I had the Libre 1 before (I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself), and it was good.\\n\\nHowever, the Libre 2 is a relevation. I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms - when they work.\\n\\nThe problem: When you put on the sensor, you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App. After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor, which is exactly 2 weeks. (You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app, but the alarms will go to the reader. I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms. If you activate with the App, the reader won\\'t work.) \\n\\nI do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times, so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3. Also, I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch, a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE. This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife.\\n\\nWhen it works - which it did at times -, the system is absolutely brilliant. It kind of gave me a new lease of life. I exercise very much, and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia.\\n\\nBUT: **The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best.** After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious \"No alarms\" warning in the app.\\n\\nDespite this, **the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings \"No connection with the sensor\" regularly, also at night.** All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep!\\n\\nLast night I was woken by several of these false alarms. This morning I got stupid \"no connection alarms\" all through the morning. The program asks you to check you sensor, but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11:30 a.m. that at my glucose was 14 mmol/l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin. So **when the system state is \"No connection\", the system will not warn about hyper- and hypoglucemia.**\\n\\nAbbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless. The whole system is a black box. Part of it works through Near field communication (NFC), part through Bluetooth (you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone), but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone\\'s Bluetooth configuration pages.\\n\\nI have 2 **questions** to the community:\\n\\n**(1) Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue?**\\n\\n**(2) Which smartphone do you use?** I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand. - Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue?

       " 'Just got up and running yesterday on Control-IQ. Yes.. I did go through the training, but I have a question about alarms that I am not sure was specifically covered.\\n\\nPrior to Control-IQ, I set my pump to not alarm for lows... I think it would always alarm for urgent lows. I always relied on my Dexcom phone app  for the alarms.\\n\\nYesterday, I had a low.. beginners bad luck. My pump alarmed at 70. I looked to see how to disable that alarm, but found that I could only set it to vibrate. Is it not possible to silence the low alarm?\\n\\nAlso... I saw on a vlogger that the tube fill continuous beeps can now be disabled.  Again, I only see the vibrate option. Am I missing something?\\n\\nThanks!',\n",
       " \"Howdy fellow T1s!\\n\\nFirst off, I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now.  I have been waiting for this for so long it's not even funny.\\n\\nBut let's talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I've been on Control IQ.\\n\\nSensor errors.\\n\\nSo I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session.  Was it slightly confusing after the hour+ long training that I didn't actually have to pair my pump to a device?  Yes.\\n\\nWorkaround: I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump.  Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected.  Probably won't have to deal with the likes of this again.  But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired.  We'll see..\\n\\nSo that sensor error...\\n\\nI awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing.  This was not, repeat, not, a compression low.  I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour (after waking up).  I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 (twice). \\n\\nWhat I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do.\\n\\nI calibrated.\\n\\nIt buzzed and told me to test again. I did so and recalibrated.\\n\\nWithin a couple minutes, the rise to 160 began on the pump.  But it didn't do it all at once.  It did it gradually over 20 minutes.   Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar.  It kicked in 2.5 units...  Um...\\n\\nSo I suspended basal and waited an hour.  I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings.  Still had a ton on board though.  It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while.  \\n\\nThis was not a relaxing experience.\\n\\nFast forward to today.  I changed the sensor last night (it was getting flakey in the evening).  This morning there was an actual compression low.  Even though I was in suspend mode, I was actually 170.  I waited for it to raise back up, after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio.  Figured that would knock me down to the 120-130 range.  But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not work out and I ended up going low.\\n\\nSO...  IN THE FUTURE...  \\n\\nAny time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low, I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour.  By then, whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won't have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change.\\n\\nIt should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience.  This may be a rare occurrence.  But if it happens to you, maybe what I'm trying will work for you.\\n\\nI'll report here if it happens again.  Also, I'll report it to customer service as well.\\n\\nHas anyone else had anything weird happen?\",\n",

I’ve been excessively thirsty, urinating way more than usual, including during the night which I’ve NEVER done before, extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class, and above all I’ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat.

She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn’t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today. Well, yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day, and then I ate lunch with a friend. Shortly after getting lunch (we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating) I had a migraine and stomach pain again, and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could. At about 7:30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn’t feel nearly that bad.

       " \"Hi, Sorry for such a long post, I just got Diagnosed as a Ti diabetic 14 days ago. 29-year-old male 250 Lbs. A little back story Never knew I had TI until a few weeks ago I started getting extremely dry mouth, urinating tons. Then I woke up throwing up, I threw up over 30 times and had zero energy, legit felt like I was dying, I thought I had food poisoning, boy was I wrong! If my mother didn't help me I would be dead right now. Thinking back on it we should have just called 911 for an ambulance. I used the last percent of energy to get into the car and she drove me to the ER. They rushed me in and my blood sugar level was over 1000. They could not get blood out of me, it was coagulating. But they finally did. I spent 6 days in ICU, the intensive care unit. My potassium levels were super low, got IV's over and over. Finally made it out and they discharged me. I feel so much better and I am so grateful to be alive and survive. The doctors said they have never seen such a high level over 1000 BS. I am on a low carb Keto diet now. I take 35 units of Levemir in the morning and take Novolog with each meal 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My blood sugar level has been in the 100's like 188 to 130 for this past week but every time around 3pm to 5pm my Blood sugar starts to drop to like 90, then 80, then 70, when this happens I drink some orange juice or glucose liquid or gel, then it spikes back up to 130 and stays like that till the morning. I have no idea why my BS keeps dropping like this every day. It's a pattern. I have been calling my doctor about and she now has me Minus 5 units for lunch and now dinner. I know that I just got diagnosed and its a feel out process my doctor doesn't know the right insulin intake yet because it's only been 2 weeks. But this scares me so much and I am afraid to go to sleep every night and is overall very stressful for me. I am doing great with my new diet. I just dip in the middle of the day. I take an AC1 test in a few weeks. I am just so new to this and wonder if anybody can help me or know why this is happening to me. \\nThis is what I have been eating every day- its the same thing everyday lol  \\n--Breakfast at 8am--\\n- 1 Cup of Cheerios cereal\\n- 1 cup of milk\\n- 1 light yogurt   - Meal equals    = 50 Carbs\\n--Snack at 10am--\\n1- boost drink\\n2- Babybel Cheeses\\n1 turkey meat stick, it's a little one  Meal equals = 28 Carbs \\n\\n--Lunch at 12 pm--\\n- McDonald's Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken \\n- 3 tablespoons of salad dressing ^  \\n- 1 cucumber with 3 cherry tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of Salad dressing.          Meal equals = 57 Carbs\\n\\n--Snack at 2 pm--\\n- 1 Apple \\n- 3 tablespoons of Cashew or Almond butter\\n- 3 Babybel Cheeses\\n- 1 or 2 turkey meat sticks    Meal equals = 40 carbs\\n\\n--Dinner at 4pm--\\n- Chicken Breast cooked in butter \\n- Salad with cucumbers 3 tablespoons of dressing, added spinach and greens\\n- 2 cups of broccoli\\n- 1 greek yogurt with 4 blueberries added to it   Meal equals =35 Carbs\\nI just wanted to put what I have been eating everyday, I am new to this and I feel like I have adjusted well since this turned my whole world upside down and I feel very scared, basically not knowing next to any information when I left the hospital. If anybody out there reads this thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can help me with any information, tips or insight about why the level keeps dropping this reply to this. I am fighting and I will never give up, I am beating this, I just want to be stable blood sugar level and be able to do stuff. Sorry for the insanely long post. I do not know what to do and I am scared. I love you all and God bless, I am on the edge hoping I get a response because this is so new to me. Thanks again.\",\n",

Clearly i didnt check it prior to eating like I thought and now im spazzing cause thats a lot of insulin that low. Im not sure what to do other then drinking juice or something and watching it. But i havent ever done this at least not in a long ass time any advice? Tried calling the drs on call no luck. Waiting on a call back.

       " '\\n\\nIn March 2018, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was 19 years old and I was around 150lbs 5’6. I found it strange getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, being that I was young and at an average weight. My doctor first put me on metformin, which seemed to work for some time. I was able to get my blood sugar under control and my A1C down to 5.6. After receiving my results, I decided to stop taking metformin to see if I can get normal blood sugar readings without it and for some time they averaged between 80-120. Months go by, and my blood sugar is still at normal range without taking metformin, so I assume I don’t have diabetes anymore. A year goes by and I’m still doing fine. I feel normal. I’m still eating healthy and working out, but I’m not checking my blood sugar because I assume that I’m not a diabetic anymore. Then November 2019 comes around and I start feeling sick (internally). It’s an unexplainable feeling. I started losing weight. I went from 150 down to 118, within a span of a couple months. I started feeling more tired, to the point where I just wanted to sleep in all day. I felt like my life was being drained away. I dealt with this for another month, until I felt that it was time for me to go see a doctor. I decided to go to the ER on 12/30/2019. When I first arrived, my blood pressure was 140/80. I told the doctor my symptoms and they did a couple tests on me and told me I had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). For those of you who don’t know what DKA is, it’s basically a life threatening condition where my body produces excess acids in my blood (ketones) caused by my blood sugar being high for a long period of time. I was hospitalized for 4 days and was put on fluids with an insulin drip. At the hospital, they did several blood tests on me. My potassium was extremely low and My A1C was at 11. They also did a test to see if I was a type 1, because they found it strange that a type 2 was being treated for DKA, since DKA is more prevalent in people with type 1. They were testing  to see if I had pancreatic antibodies, and my results came up as positive. I’m assuming my doctors from 2 years ago didn’t do the pancreatic antibody test because it would have showed up as positive. I’m now feeling so much better now that I’m getting the proper treatment. Im currently taking insulin and eating less carbs/no sugar with a proper workout routine. My blood sugar isn’t quite at the range I want it to be, but day by day it’s getting better.

I haven\\'t done it though, I\\'ve just lurked and tried to google-fu my way through figuring things out.\\n\\nI was keto for a long time, and so I\\'ve tried making a ton of different low carb things for her to eat, so that she could have tasty snacks between meals that fit the criteria her endo set. Ya know, beyond, \"go eat a cheese stick/meat stick\". She has declared hate for most of them (usually after learning they contain ingredients her father is allergic to).\\n\\nHer school nurse has asked that we drop off granola bars or some snack that is 10-15 carbs and at least 7 grams protein for a morning snack as she keeps dipping so low. AFAIK no such bar exists unless we\\'re talking about net carbs, which we aren\\'t. \\n\\nToday at the store not only did I find a yogurt that is dairy AND soy free (I\\'ve been living off trail mix and roasted veggies) but I also found yogurt that is 3 grams of carbs and 12 grams protein! My husband was rather nonplussed when I told him but I am so excited to find something that fits our needs! It feels like the universe cut me a tiny slice of a break. \\n\\nTL;DR found super low carb, high protein yogurt at the store for my 7 yr old diabetic! Hooray',\n",

Then I hear a stern, adult, voice. “I know your vaping in here you didn’t even use the bathroom.” My adrenaline began pumping, I wasn’t vaping. I was just unable to get myself to use the bathroom. Because of how “in the moment” I was, I never even thought to look at my blood sugar (Dexcom G6 by the way). The adult was an assistant principal. I walked out and in a regular toned voice (because I didn’t want an entire hall to know that I was struggling to use the bathroom) told him I was just having a hard time going.

Didn’t have any people who I could relate to or discuss diabetes with. A lot of times, even our endocrinologists and diabetic nurses can’t understand the emotional and mental strain this autoimmune disease has on us. \\n\\nA lot of us are the only ones in our family who are type ones. And those who don’t have the disease think that simply creating and following a structure makes it an “easy illness”. That we shouldn’t complain or be frustrated because we’re not going to die if we do what needs to be done.\\n\\nHowever, living and managing type one diabetes goes against the way we naturally should live life. People don’t wake up and worry about what their BGs are or if they are calculating the right amount of insulin to properly break down the sugar in the foods they consume. They don’t get worried about their blood sugar going high and entering DKA or running low in their sleep and potentially entering a comma.\\n\\nI found this reddit group about 6 months ago. Reading all the questions, comments, comedy, and outright support made me cry. And I just wanted to say thank you.

We talked about a lot of ideas but this concept should be the easiest for the user. We will host these threads every 2-4 weeks depending on how many they are used and the thread will stay up for 3 days.\\n\\n**Discord**\\n\\nWe also talked about a Discord a lot.

Going over them with the researcher to verify their integrity and their goals took a long time. We would often exchange several long messages about the survey. And while I certainly didn't mind doing that it seems that it just isn't worth it. Whenever a survey did get approved nobody was interested in them and they would barely get any comments, upvotes or responses. Understandably so, as someone with diabetes you probably get asked to fill in a survey a lot. If this is something the community doesn't want then the lengthy approval process.\\n\\nWe put up a few rules for content creators and influencers. It's still allowed but it must be kept to reasonable levels. Content creators should also link to their content directly, not just to their profiles. Post that were simply asking for followers/subscribers because the owner of the profile has type 1 diabetes are no longer allowed.\\n\\nAnd finally we set up some guidelines for posting CGM graphs. These are posted quite frequently and they will continue to be allowed but very low effort ones may be removed. The graphs must be accompanied by some context, what are we looking at, what is happening, what is going wrong/good? It should also be clear what the scale of the graph is. Sometimes a graph is posted that doesn't include any numbers at all. And we can't possibly see whether their blood sugar at that moment is 100 mg/dL or 200 mg/dL.

Reversing Diabetes is no longer a possibility ? it's a reality.\\n\\nScientists, who carried out the study on 238 patients, found that their approach led to dramatic improvements. Half of their patients saw their condition reversed after just 10 weeks and were able to reduce or stop taking Diabetes drugs. 89% of those in the study, who had been reliant on insulin due to the severity of their disease, were able to dramatically reduce or stop taking it.\\n\\nOne of the researchers behind this study – Professor Hallberg said that the standard advice for Diabetes patients needs to be changed because she believes Type 2 can be reversed, in many if not most situations, especially if treated early. Science has confirmed that there is only one way to freedom from this horrible condition. The most effective solution – a 3 phase strategy to reversing Diabetes was used with awe-inspiring 90% success rate.\\n\\nThe most important conclusion of all the research is this: developing a tailored program leads to providing each patient with the maximum perception of improvement.

My life hasn’t been very great and a lot of it I couldn’t help because I was a kid, I’m currently 23 years old right now. Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night. You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles? Yeah I’d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes. I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day, l was even craving the most random things I’ve never craved before.. after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant! So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said “your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you’re under DKA” all I could say was ok. I called my mom and said “mom I’m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly...I have diabetes.” There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry. I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room. Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here. I don’t have insurance and my job isn’t very good, they’ve cut my hours because of how sick I’ve been. I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn’t listen to me.. she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin (Levemir, Novolog) at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM, over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm. After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir... my sugars were still sitting in the 380 - 420 I kept begging her that it’s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I’m killing myself rather than helping myself.. I ended up losing about 30+ pounds in 3 months. I was 145 lbs before diagnosed, today 1/9/2020 I’m now 114lbs and not happy at all... I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels, for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I’m not even financially stabled or have insurance. On 1/4/2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out, turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 (in June it was at 7.5) thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that’s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus! Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that’s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir ... so even when I was injecting myself with insulin.....nothing was happening ... to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I’ve been using Levemir it wasn’t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I’m doing everything I can possibly do...

I needed brain surgery, a piece of the knife was imbedded into my skull and JUST millimetres from my brain. Surgery went great, i recovered and took me about 3 weeks before i was discharged. fast forward about one month, i started having pains on the top of my head where i had surgery, i went to the hospital and i had a very rare blood infection in my body from the dirty knife i was stabbed with. (hunting blade) and i needed to take IV medication everyday for 2 hours, they told me if i don’t take it, there’s a 90% chance i’ll die from this infection, but this medication had side effects, i didn’t want to hear it, i was too stressed out at that point. I did the IV medication for nearly 6 weeks, the infection was gone from my body. Fast forward 1 month, i’m back living with my parents, i was always tired, sleeping, no appetite and short of breath. My mom is type 2, she tested my BG and it was 27.0 mmol. She took me to the hospital right away, i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 20, weight 210, 6’2, i was healthy, ate normal, and lived a normal life. I’m now a type 1 diabetic, forever. I want opinions or to hear any feedback on this, i’m not blaming it on the medication i took, but it’s a big chance it was. Thank you for reading.',\n",

       " 'Hi all! Been a diabetic for almost 20 years so usually I know what I’m doing alright, but recently ran into a problem. I have been trying to get a pump for about 10 years now, but have had many problems do to insurance and money and all kinds of things. I’ve finally got a new job with really good insurance (that pays terribly but that’s a complaint for r/antiwork ha!)  I have an appointment with Endo at end of month all well and good. In my state however to get an insulin pump even with insurance you need 3 months of logged blood sugar results (at least 4 a day) and an A1C of under 7. I test closer to 10 times a day so not a problem there, and for months my blood sugar has been where it needed to be with an average of about 135 since about June. I have been working hard to keep it that way to get my pump, hence the 10 tests a day (strips without insurance are a bitch). However lately (most of December I’d say) despite doing everything the exact same as I have been doing, I’ve been running outrageously high for no reason. I even upped my lantus from 20u a day to 25u (didn’t want to go too drastic because I know going too high can actually cause you to run higher!). Using same ratios I’ve been using that was keeping me fine seems to just not be working anymore.  I’m constantly over 250 now. Just this morning I woke up at 248, gave 5 units (according to ratio I should have given 2) went back to bed woke up an hour later and was 313. I’d say maybe it could be  sickness but it’s been about a month of this constant high blood sugars. I can’t see endo till end of month and I’d actually prefer to get handled before I see him so I can immediately show him my GOOD results and get pump as quick as possible. Any help would be very appreciated. I’m just lost here and don’t know what happened! Worried it’s already ruined my chances of A1C below 7 as well.',\n",

       " 'Okay, so I have been using Tandem\\'s Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all, before this experiment, I was DIY looping with Omnipod (off-label). Being off-label, this system has it\\'s quirks, but there are a couple features, intensity, and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBefore jumping into what I like and don\\'t like about Control IQ, I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works. \\n\\nFirst off, Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal. The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading (it\\'s only integrated with Dexcomg G6) to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus, just be increased, no change at all, be decreased, or be completely suspended. The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes. Below is the Control IQ tier system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n ≥  **180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg/dL within 30 minutes, there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus. The correction bolus is 60% of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg/dL every 60 minutes. This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing.\\n\\n**160 - 180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **increased**. \\n\\n**112.5 - 159 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **not changed**. \\n\\n**112.4 - 70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **decreased**. \\n\\n ≤  **70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, basal is **suspended**. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy thoughts...\\n\\nAfter about 3 days of using Control IQ, my average is higher than what I like. However there are less lows which is awesome. BUT, my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping.  The reason for this is that unlike looping, Control IQ software doesn\\'t not use **carbs on board**. Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten.  This would be fine, if you didn\\'t have to use the CGM reading, but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus, the Tandem pump doesn\\'t remember how many carbs on are board. \\n\\nFor instance, I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg/dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced  bolus of 0.6 U. I then \"trying to be good\" used the recommendation. I then decided to have an apple, so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams, but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg/dL, the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin, it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg/dL. This isn\\'t super high, but this could have been completely avoided. ALSO, I couldn\\'t stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions, I would have been much higher. It recommended 0U, but I took 0.7U (usually I\\'m about 1U for an apple). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other feature I\\'m not crazy about is the tube. I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years, so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D, but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice, especially during workouts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple features I DO like...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like that the software works, all the time. Even if it isn\\'t nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be, I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments. With my closed loop Omnipod system, I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink (device used to connect pod to phone) and phone were connected and working. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s also nice not to have to carry an additional device (the rileylink), but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump. So that\\'s not a big change.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like the sleep feature. This allows for a tighter range, but doesn\\'t allow for the automated correction bolus. However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg/dL, your basal is increased. With normal settings, basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg/dL or above. \\n\\nOh, and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem, however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOverall I think for the masses, Control IQ could be rather helpful tool. However,  I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me, but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTAKEAWAY: Control IQ is less work but doesn\\'t allow the as tight control compared to looping. DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on, but I like the control, and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*This is just a short snapshot, I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ. I have early access to this because I\\'m a T1D, CDE, and a RDN. It\\'s a bit of work to review and report, but I hope this information is helpful to you.*',\n",

       " 'Hello all! I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer, in my case, my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons, and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue. I also take biologic meds for my illness, and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses, including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer. \\n\\nI’ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes, and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes, the illness doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the person’s daily life, and their overall ability to function and work a normal job. \\n\\nI’ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories, where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me’s in order to cover the costs of insulin, or having to resort to “Walmart insulin” (that sounds atrocious) when they don’t have insurance, and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance. \\n\\nNO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes. Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things, and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d. \\n\\nWhat are your options where you live, in the event that you don’t have health insurance? How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn’t available? \\n\\nSome states offer Medicaid, and among the states that offer Medicaid, some offer a program called “Medicaid buyin” where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market. Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid, or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid?\\n\\nRegarding employment, how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance, as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don’t have to cover health insurance? \\n\\nIf you do have a job that offers you health insurance, have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance? The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment. I don’t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person’s ability to access a life-sustaining medication, this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor, that’s it. \\n\\nI realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive, but are generally able-bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands. This would also include working long hours, as well as overtime. Someone like myself wouldn’t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes. Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized, compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities? My condition wouldn’t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds, but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn’t want to remain in that state for any length of time. \\n\\nAnd, lastly, how does your illness impact things for you socially? Are there social situations, job situations, or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative, judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you? How have strangers reacted? How have friends and/or significant others reacted?\\n\\nI live in Colorado, where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions. Here are the links for that, as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state. Your state may have a similar buyin program, I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized. \\n\\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/hcpf/medicaid-buy-program-working-adults-disabilities\\n\\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm\\n\\nAlso- feel free to ask me any questions about my autoimmune disease! I’m intrigued by science and medical stuff, and how it impacts our daily lives.',\n",
       " \"I guess I'll preface this by saying something that we all probably know well - this sucks. Basic, but true. And as I've explained to friends who have asked how they can help, only people with T1D can really understand the problems that come with it. I honestly don't think anyone who doesn't live with this in some capacity can understand constantly maintaining blood sugar levels, calculating insulin doses, giving yourself constant injections, etc. I know what it's like to think about T1D and just have your mood drop. I know what it's like to cry, and to just feel anger, and sadness, and a tidal wave of emotion hit you during a routine diabetic activity, whatever it may be. And I'm trying to say that it's okay. It's okay to hurt. It's okay to be angry, to be sad, to freak out, to cry, to express whatever you might feel. Just remember that you're stronger than this and that you can fight it. Believe in yourself - but don't force yourself to always be strong. Sometimes a good cry can make all the difference.\",\n",

This is FAR too high. I’m at 5.8 right now and I know if I injected a unit I would go hypo but I wouldn’t drop THAT far. \\n\\nIt seems to me that this is an inevitable problem with a lower carb diet. I don’t take much rapid insulin because I do not consume very many carbs that need balancing. This in itself doesn’t mean I am insulin sensitive (although I appreciate that I am). I could just go high, wait until there is no insulin in the system and then give myself a unit to determine a correction factor experimentally but it strikes me that this is likely to yield a poor precision if I were to do it again on another day... \\n\\nHow can we distinguish an individual with a moderate insulin sensitivity and low carb diet from a higher carb diet individual with high insulin sensitivity?? \\n\\n\\nThe deets; \\n- 31 yr old male\\n- diagnosis 3 months ago\\n- freestyle libre with novorapid and basarglar. \\n\\nThanks!',\n",

       " 'Hi, I’m Kaylynn. My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic. He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult. My husband takes 2 different insulin’s 1 of them is long acting Lantus &amp; the other is fast acting Humalog. \\nUnfortunately &amp; absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail, he has been they’re since 9-27-19 - presently. We had talked to somebody who works there, who answered questions we had, I had brought up my husband’s diabetes &amp; the difficulties he faces with his diabetes, this woman “assured” me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and “knew what they were doing” They’re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different, when my husband first went in it took 2-3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him, learn about his medical conditions/medications all that stuff. He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are @ 7am he gets both Lantus &amp; Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of, @ 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin’s then the night medications that were approved. Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm. That’s it. \\nOkay, now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much, please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I’m saying, is there anything I can try to do about this? Recommendations? I’d very much appreciate it. I’m lost with what I can even do about this. 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️🤦🏻\\u200d♀️🙏🏻😔 I know this is really long, please bare with me, I’m new here &amp; trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand. Okay here we go. \\nSo, this is what started first then so on, so on \\nI received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly “he doesn’t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I’m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn’t care. So I got up, got dressed &amp; got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I’ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house. I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call &amp; explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home, &amp; that since you all are administrating his medications to him, calling in refills, etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills. And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail, and we don’t know when or if he’s going to be released. \\nI know this is very long so I’m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it’s very important. \\n• I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that “contact the pharmacy” because that’s not they’re responsibility. And that whoever basically is his other half, emergency contact, on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications. \\n•So what I’ve been dealing with lately is when he calls (not every call) but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left. If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won’t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up &amp; then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine. \\n•These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him, that what they were wanting to do would not “help him at all” they forced him to take it and he nearly OD. So then they put him back on his original dose\\nThere’s been so much damn more. This is already long as hell. \\nSo lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin’s and put him only on Novolog 70/30 and he said no he wouldn’t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him. \\n•He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn’t know what he’s talking about having to do with his insulin, but 100% without a doubt think they know what they’re doing!! \\nThey’re wrong af, changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable. There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20-30units when his sugars to high?!?!

Until they have a full CGM system like Dexcom, they will be lagging. Their big advantage is cheap sensors. Maybe Abbott will create a new Libre that pushes updates via bluetooth, but even the Libre 2 (out in Europe) doesn't really do that. It just alerts you if high/low and you still need to scan the sensor. \\n* Medtronic's Guardian/Enlite is mediocre and the only people who use it were forced to because of their pump choice.

Does anyone else feel that they actually have a slight benefit to their existence because of this disease? \\n\\nRecently, I’ve come to realize how much this disease has developed my way of thinking, and way of living. I feel that I am able to empathize well with others because of diabetes. The many times I have felt humiliated because of public hypoglycemic episodes, giving shots, or just being a spectacle in my classrooms. It’s something I had to get used to early. Aside from that, I feel like I know MYSELF, so very well. I’m at a comfortable point in my life with this condition, to where I often catch physiological signs of my blood sugar altering without checking my blood sugar (of course I do check to confirm those feelings).  I am very confident that my journey with this disease has allowed me to know myself, and the interactions that I have with the world. Not only that, but I feel that both my physical and emotional awareness is finely tuned to the world I’m in. I understand hastily, my emotions and the source of them in countless scenarios. I have a very solidified sense of self thanks to the hours of my life spent inside my head, plotting different courses of actions to account for my disability.\\n\\nAll of this is the bi-product of getting down and dirty with this disease. I embraced the life choices I would have to make at a very early age, which I feel is the biggest unseen benefit of it all. I have not known a life outside of the rollercoaster of diabetes, but instead my whole subconscious was setting itself up to succeed with it.\\n\\nEmbrace the insanity that sometimes can be this disease.

There’s no more room and they stop caring about the white balls. Aka insulin resistance.\\n\\nHOWEVER, in type 1 diabetes, the player (again, your body) has taken all four hippos from the board and smashed them into pieces until there’s no more hippos (insulin). There’s nothing to eat up the white balls and they simply sit In the ring (your bloodstream). Basically, diabetics are now forced to bring along their own hippos every time they want to play the game.

I have come up with something that might combine those two ideas into one. At first I wondered: how is this group going to be different from the existing ones? The /r/diabetes_t1 chatroom has 750 members, the /r/diabetes Discord has 1500 members, is there a point in making another Discord that does essentially the same thing? So maybe we should do something different entirely. Having 750 or 1500 people in the chatrooms is great for sharing information and hearing lots of opinions on your problems, but it isn't ideal for a more personal conversation or making friends. Don't get me wrong, it's not impossible but with that many people you are going to see different names every day and having 1000 people look over your shoulder when talking to someone else doesn't make it any more comfortable to talk about your problems.\\n\\nSo how would everyone feel about instead of making a big Discord, which would function like a clone the existing /r/diabetes Discord, to make a series of smaller ones for 6-10 people. They would function as some sort of support groups(but not necessarily be just for people who are really struggling with their diabetes). Here you ca n talk to the others and stay in touch with them for a longer period of time, so you can really make friends. They also would never get so back that you would lose track of who is in the group.\\n\\nOf course I am not entirely sure if this is something people want, it's definitely not for everyone. Due to the nature of these groups there are some difference with being in a regular Discord as well. First off: the users in the groups really have to participate. If a group consists of 6 people and 4 are lurkers who never say anything then that won't work. And of course the invite to the Discord groups can't just be put online, then they would quickly reach a hundred people again. I am thinking that to apply those interested in joining should just send a brief message with basic information about them self(this wouldn't be a personality test, just a few basics like age, country, diagnosed for how many years, gender and such) to make sure there won't be anyone put in a group where they wouldn't feel comfortable.\\n\\nI hope my explanation of this idea was clear, if it isn't then feel free to ask questions.

The other 3 days have been blood sugar related issues. Now in his attendance notes, these are all property noted as such because i call the school each day he misses school.

       " 'Hello All,\\n\\nAbout 6 weeks ago, I (46 year old male), I received a surprising diagnosis of LADA.  Which if I understand correctly, is basically an adult onset of type 1.\\n\\nThe brief backstory;  for much of the late summer and fall, I was feeling tired, achy, weak, grumpy, and then later, dehydrated with unquenchable thirst.    And first I thought it was an autumn cold or something, but it kept getting worse.  I started to worry that I had Lyme disease or something.   My GP looked me over and took blood, meanwhile booking me a followup with Rheumatology.   But when the blood results started coming back, my glucose was 771.  They told me to go right to the ER.\\n\\nSo now here I am.  I feel a lot better than I did when my glucose was so high.  Apparently, I\\'m still producing insulin enough that my levels are in an acceptable range via Janumet and cutting sugar and carbs (mostly between 100 and 125).   I\\'ve seen my new endocrinologist twice, I\\'ve been pricking my fingers a lot, and I\\'ve been trying to figure out a new diet.\\n\\nThanks for keeping with me (I\\'m guessing that what I wrote seems like a familiar story to a lot of you), here are my questions...\\n\\nFrom what I understand, I\\'m really very lucky that I\\'m still producing insulin and that injections aren\\'t necessary yet.  My endocrinologist suggests that if I continue to be lucky, this may last for quite a while, though she didn\\'t want to estimate how long that may be.  Is this the \"honeymoon\" period that I\\'ve read about?   And is it true that the better my diet now (and the lower that I\\'m keeping my glucose), the longer that period may last?  Did any of you have a similar path?\\n\\nAlthough I\\'m feeling much better overall, I can\\'t shake a bit of body fatigue.  I\\'ve always been somewhat thin, and have kept up, more or less, with a simple exercise schedule.  But now exercise kind of sucks (although to be fair, my head\\'s not really in to it either).  And although I\\'m not so desperately crazy thirsty like before, there\\'s still some dehydration even though I\\'m trying to drink a good amount of water.   Any tips for getting my energy back and feeling as normal as possible?  Does the dehydration feeling go away?\\n\\nAnd damnable food.  I\\'ve been a vegetarian for my adult life, but I ate rather a lot of bread and fruit before.  And now, I\\'ve all but eliminated both.  I\\'m sick to death of nuts, eggs, cheese, tofu, and fake meat.  Raw vegetables are good, though don\\'t seem as compelling as they should.  Even avocados;  as much as I love them, it just doesn\\'t seem satisfying to eat them without good bread.     (Giving up pasta and rice has so far been OK.)    But overall, food just isn\\'t fun anymore.  It\\'s just a necessary chore, finding the balance of getting enough protein and nutrients from food that is otherwise trying to kill me with its carbs.\\n\\nSo maybe this is just something I have to work out on my own, but any suggestions for a diet that feels more satisfying?  I\\'d even consider working meat/fish back in, if necessary.\\n\\nThank you for all of your help!',\n",

That\\'s important, because fairly typically we don\\'t read instructions. We know better. \\n\\nSo I ask my wife to help out since I want to make sure I get the placement just right to mitigate any possibility that whatever I\\'m allergic to isn\\'t hitting skin. I take out the roll, cut a piece into a larger-than-the-libre circle, take of the protective film and apply it to my arm.\\n\\nSoon as it\\'s on, I say to my wife \"this doesn\\'t look right, it\\'s not really sticking...\" but just kinda plow on, since most of it seemed pretty adhered to my skin. Sensor on, scan it, and things seem alright. \\n\\nSome of you might already be chuckling.\\n\\nFast forward to the next morning. I look down, and sure enough the sensor is barely hanging in there. Upon closer inspection, I see the actual barrier firmly adhered to my arm... then the second layer of protective film (d\\'oh) flopping around with the sensor attached to it.\\n\\nTldr, did not realize there were two layers of protective film on tegaderm, shot sensor through a later of protective film, protective barrier, and then finally skin. I am now resorting to a large self-adhesive wrap bandage to keep the sensor from falling off to see if tegaderm prevents whatever stupid allergic reaction my body seems intent on triggering when I try to prolong it\\'s stupid life by using modern medical technology.\\n\\nSome days are shit, especially in this long drawn out transition when my BG can make no sense, but for some reason this lovely little failure was a laughing moment.',\n",

I don’t know if this is common thing that may happen to diabetics randomly, or if there may be a chance that my insulin has gone bad? I have been storing my pens in the fridge like normal until I begin using a new pen, but I have wondered if my fridge is too cold.\\n\\nUntil recently, I have been doing 1 unit:8g carbs of Humalog and about 20 units of tresiba in the morning, with a correction dose of 1 unit of humalog for every 50 over 150, for any reading over 150. In the past few days I have upped my Tresiba dose to 32 units per day and I have gone through over 180 units of humalog in the past two days (though, my carb consumption hasn't increased that much, despite the thanksgiving holiday—normally I can get a 300u humalog pen to last well over a week). I have been giving up to (and sometimes over) 20 units for a standard meal that has probably 50-80g of carbs, and correction doses over twice what I normally do, and I am even having trouble even causing myself to have a low reading. \\n\\nThis morning, my glucose reading was over 300 when I woke up, despite it being pretty stable levels (~120 and steady)before bed, and fasting throughout the night and drinking a lot of water. Typically, I have been having good (90-120) to moderately low (60-80) readings in the morning since I have switched from Lantus to Tresiba. Yesterday, I had taken 28 units of tresiba, and today I upped my dose to 32 units after such a high reading, and my body is still very insensitive to insulin and my sugars have been moderately high\\nthroughout the day (low 200's), without much response by a high bolus dose of humalog.\\n\\nWhat’s concerning me is that if the insulin I’m using has gone bad, I won’t really know until I try insulin straight from the Pharmacy and it potentially causes severe low glucose levels. But, it seems that a decrease in insulin sensitivity of this magnitude is a bit absurd, at least in my experience as a T1 diabetic for 12 years. This has been so frustrating!\\n\\nAdditional context: I was diagnosed with Central Adrenal Insufficiency in 2010 and was on Predinisone until 2017, when I had my cortisol levels tested again and found out that I no longer have the disease. However, lack of cortisol caused my glucose levels to get dangerously low and induced seizures, while Predisone caused my glucose levels to be absurdly high after my adrenal gland went back to normal. I have not taken Prednisone in over 2 years.\",\n",

I have had many pumps that have broken in the past, most diagnosed as a battery failure/malfunction. The broken pumps had nothing to do with anything I did wrong except for one where the screen cracked while I was sleeping.\\n\\n1 month ago I was contacted by Tandem and they told me I would be getting upgraded when my pump warranty was up in a month. The localbrep Jordyn Dooley was nice and got me all set up with a customer service rep. Both were very enthusiastic about me getting the new pump. During the last 2 weeks I went and got the dexcom G6 in anticipation for my new tslim pump.\\n\\nSo this past Monday I never got the renewal call as promised. Tuesday, no call. Now I am concerned and I called them. They tell me someone will call me back. Today I call them and I got told that they won't be issuing me a new pump and to call my doctor. I asked to speak to a supervisor because the woman on the phone was being very short and rude towards me and I could sense a very bad time in her voice. She refused to get me a supervisor and hung up. I called back and the next customer service rep, Brooke, told me there was no one at all at Tandem for me to talk to. After some back and forth with her she tells me that the Director of Sales will call me on Monday, I ask for his name and she mumbles some profanity then hangs up.\\n\\nSo now I am pretty upset and I call back again. She just keeps picking up and immediately disconnecting, and this happened like 5 or 6 times. I am beginning to have some panic attacks, this is my life and I am not calling about getting like my gutters cleaned here... I go upstairs and ask my wife to call from her phone. The customer service rep, Brooke, immediately answers and is now talking to my wife. She is extremely rude to my wife when she realizes my wife is calling to get some information for me. She gives my wife the name of the Director of Sales, Jim Simpson, but refuses to give any other info on how to contact him. Ultimately she just hangs up on my wife as well. \\n\\n5 hours later I actually get a call from Jim Simpson. He tells me I am no longer a good fit for Tandem because I am not a good look for them with all of the broken pumps I have had. I tell him that I don't be live that is very fair as the pumps that have broken were not my fault. I mean it's not like I have done anything to cause the pumps to break, I live a very normal life, although I do have many problems from my 32 years with diabetes; kidney disease, advanced retinopathy, and neuropathy. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, but that is all of the activity I am involved in, so the pumps are not put through any stress. \\n\\nWhat do I do from here? Diabetes is enough of a problem and it has been a lot on my wife and my son, on top of all of the other problems that have come from my diabetes. To be treated like this by a company that is supposed to be doing things to make life better for diabetics is extremely upsetting. I am on Medicare so I don't have many choices. I would switch to Medtronic's closed loop pump, but unfortunately Medicare won't allow me to use the Medtronic cgm, so tandem is really my only choice.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? Maybe the best thing is for my story to go viral so Tandem knows I am not just another number and I am a person, a diabetic with feelings, and a person who doesn't deserve to be treated like they don't matter. \\n\\nThank you for reading all of this if you did. 🖤🖤🖤\",\n",
