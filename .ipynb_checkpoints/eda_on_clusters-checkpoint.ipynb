I have been in counseling for two months and I am having mental health concerns consistent with cyclothymia that is almost like a soft bipolar disorder. My counselor suggested that I reach out to the diabetic community and see if it may be a common experience. I know that having a chronic disease in general can make you more prone to depression too, so I thought I would ask here.   \n",

It’s resulted in great blood sugar control but in the last few check ups he’s been falling well behind on height milestones.  \\n\\nDoes anyone have any experience good or bad with this?

I have been in counseling for two months and I am having mental health concerns consistent with cyclothymia that is almost like a soft bipolar disorder. My counselor suggested that I reach out to the diabetic community and see if it may be a common experience. I know that having a chronic disease in general can make you more prone to depression too, so I thought I would ask here.   \n",

       "      <td>This article looks at how you can reverse type 2 diabetes naturally.\\n\\nDiabetes is one of the most popular diseases in people around the world. It is a condition that makes your blood sugar level higher than normal. Diabetes can be divided into Type 1 and Type Diabetes, the latter being the most common.\\n\\n# What is type 2 diabetes? Important &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ([Complete Guide About Diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/search/label/Diabetes)) &amp;lt;&amp;lt;\\n\\nThis is a chronic condition that prevents your body from using the insulin it produces properly. Insulin is responsible for regulating the movement of sugar in your cells. In type 2 diabetes, instead of the body converting sugar into energy, it stores it in the bloodstream.\\n\\nThe difference between [type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-diabetes-dysfunction-and-dementia-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) and type 1 diabetes is that the latter is caused by insufficient insulin in the body due to the immune system in some people who destroy the cells that produce insulin. Unlike type 2 diabetes, a person's lifestyle does not contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, making it difficult to prevent it.\\n\\n# Why type 2 diabetes occurs\\n\\nThis type of diabetes occurs because the body cells become insulin resistant, ignoring sugar from the blood. If there is too much sugar in your bloodstream for a longer period of time, muscle and fat cells ignore the instructions of insulin to remove sugar from the blood and therefore more sugar accumulation in your bloodstream. Under normal circumstances, your pancreas produces enough insulin to drive sugar into your cells. However, during the development phase of type 2 diabetes, your cells ignore sugar and therefore the sugar continues to move freely in your bloodstream. This forces the pancreas to produce more insulin to try to maintain normal sugar levels, but fails to keep up with the long-term pace. The excess sugar in your body is sometimes converted and stored as cholesterol, which is why most victims of this type of diabetes are overweight. Inactive lifestyles, smoking, and poor nutrition are the most important factors associated with the development of this diabetes. The disease can also be hereditary. Although the disease can affect a person of any age, people from the early to mid 40s have a higher risk of getting this condition.\\n\\n# What it is like on a daily basis for people with type 2 diabetes\\n\\n[People with type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-Diabetes-Symptoms-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) have the highest risk of increased hunger, fatigue, numbness of the hands and feet, excessive thirst and the urge to urinate frequently. Blurred vision, weight loss and slow cure for infections other symptoms that people with diabetes have. These symptoms develop gradually so that some people will not notice the change in life and will not even know that they are suffering from this condition. This condition is progressive and can have devastating consequences if it is not checked in time. Over time, high levels of sugar in the bloodstream can cause damage to small blood vessels and optic nerves, kidneys, or worse the heart. Large arteries run a high risk of hardening, which can lead to heart failure and stroke. Frequent urination can lead to excessive loss of water in the body, causing it to dry out. The kidneys are also forced to work harder so they can fail. In the worst condition, type 2 diabetes can lead to organ failure, causing amputation. Keeping on taking medication is a struggle that people with type 2 diabetes must endure every day for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n# Treatment for type 2 diabetes\\n\\nIf you, a family member or a friend are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you will be happy to know that there are treatment methods that can control or even reverse the condition.\\n\\n# Diet and training treatment\\n\\nThe first way to treat type 2 diabetes is to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep your body fit. By exercising your body consumes a lot of energy, hence the need to process more sugar. If more sugar is processed, there will be no excess sugar in your blood. When it comes to dieting, avoid high protein and fat intake and make complex carbohydrates a large part of your meals instead. Such carbohydrates include whole grains, potatoes, and pasta. You should also regularly take meals in small amounts to ensure a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream. If you maintain a healthy lifestyle, you can easily fight the disease without using drugs.\\n\\n# Medication approach and [management of type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/12/diabetes-management-nurse-training.html)\\n\\nAlthough the above treatment approach is simple and easy to follow, it may not be certain whether it will work, hence the need for medication. Medications are usually given to help the body respond more quickly to insulin. Below are some of the drugs that people must take to survive if they have type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n**Metformin andquot**; This medicine works by reducing the amount of sugar released by the liver and reducing sugar absorption in the digestive tract. This automatically lowers blood sugar levels and therefore makes cells sensitive to insulin. However, this medication can cause bloating, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\\n\\n**Sulfonylureas and quot;** This medicine works by stimulating insulin production. However, they may stop working after some time, cause weight gain and abnormally lower sugar levels.\\n\\n**Biguanides survey;** These drugs work by reducing the amount of glucose in the body. The side effect of this medication includes weight loss.\\n\\n**Megalitinides survey;** These medicines are taken before meals with the aim of stimulating the production of insulin. Their impact is short-lived, although they have immediate effects. They can cause low blood sugar levels and cause you to arrive.\\n\\n**Thiazolidinediones -** These drugs work by allowing body cells to accept insulin. However, they can cause a heart attack. SGLT2 inhibitors - They work by preventing the re-uptake of sugar in the blood by preventing the kidneys from losing it in the urine. However, they can cause low blood pressure, vaginal yeast infections, diabetic ketoacidosis and urinary tract infections. Regardless of their side effects, these drugs are good for patients at risk for heart attack or stroke.\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors; They block the functionality of dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Their side effects are joint pain and pancreatitis.\\n\\nGLP-1 receptor agonists and quot; These are injections that slow down the metabolism and therefore lower the blood sugar level. They can cause weight loss, pancreatitis and nausea.\\n\\nThe decision to use medication can be influenced by various factors, including blood sugar levels and other health problems you may have. Finding the ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes may require medical advice. You may need to combine different medicines to control your disease.\\n\\nDo you have to keep using the above medication for a lifetime? Is it possible to reverse type 2 diabetes? Well, there are some programs designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who treat the condition naturally. Such a program is The Big Diabetes Lie.\\n\\nThe Big Diabetes Lie. This is a 456-page book written by Max Sidorov and The International Council for Truth in Medicine (ICTM). It contains strategies for naturally reversing type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, the book promises to free you from drug slavery through a procedural health guide called The 7 Steps to Healthy and the Big Diabetes Lie.\\n\\n# How it works\\n\\nThe program informs users about everything that has to do with type 2 diabetes, how it develops and how to combat it. With this program they learn about the adjustments they can make to their lifestyle to protect them against not only type 2 diabetes, but also against other diseases. The program asks the reader the question: do your current food choices keep you diabetic? Some of the lessons that will be learned from this book include healthy food and the avoidable, choice of vitamins, distinguishing healthy fats from the unhealthy, and how, among other things, to reduce the craving for food. The book also teaches you how to maintain the correct PH level to make your body unfriendly to diseases such as cancer. In general, the guide emphasizes healthy eating and lifestyle routines as the key to controlling and even reversing type 2 diabetes and preventing an attack by other diseases.\\n\\nThe Big Diabetes Lie claims that the pharmaceutical industry is out to exploit the people living with type 2 diabetes. Based on the authors' argument, the industry is running for profit by selling drugs that they know cannot fully treat Type 2 Diabetes, but insist that one cannot survive without their use. The major pharmaceutical companies are afraid that other successful approaches will affect their business results and bankrupt them. According to the authors, drugs treat symptoms instead of removing the cause of the disease and cause even more life-threatening side effects compared to those of the disease itself. This is evident in the medicines mentioned above because none of them lacks a side effect.\\n\\n# Why it is successful\\n\\nUnlike the drugs that only address the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, this program addresses the cause of the problem to free the patient forever. It teaches you how to reverse type 2 diabetes naturally. Medicines are only intended to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. The guide also uses natural strategies and does not cause any adverse consequences for the user. The program has worked for thousands of people around the world and perhaps your solution.\\n\\nConclusion All in all, type 2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disease. Although there are other factors, a poor lifestyle is the main culprit. Informing people about this disease is the first step to combat it. How do we inform the victims and prevent others from being diagnosed? Understanding everything about the situation is the key. The above guide sketches practically everything about this disease. There must be public awareness of what people should eat, how they should exercise, control their weight and change their lifestyle. Most people have a hectic life and have little or no time to exercise. To make matters worse, they consume junk food in large quantities, making them easy prey for type 2 diabetes. With proper training on observing a healthy lifestyle, type 2 diabetes can become a thing of the past. This can be the breakthrough of diabetes that saves your life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How to Naturally Reverse Type 2 DiabetesThis article looks at how you can reverse type 2 diabetes naturally Diabetes is one of the most popular diseases in people around the world It is a condition that makes your blood sugar level higher than normal Diabetes can be divided into Type 1 and Type Diabetes the latter being the most common What is type 2 diabetes Important gt gt Complete Guide About Diabetes https www howwebs com search label Diabetes lt lt This is a chronic condition that prevents your body from using the insulin it produces properly Insulin is responsible for regulating the movement of sugar in your cells In type 2 diabetes instead of the body converting sugar into energy it stores it in the bloodstream The difference between type 2 diabetes https www howwebs com 2018 11 Type 2 diabetes dysfunction and dementia Diabetes Health How Webs United States USA html and type 1 diabetes is that the latter is caused by insufficient insulin in the body due to the immune system in some people who destroy the cells that produce insulin Unlike type 2 diabetes a person s lifestyle does not contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes making it difficult to prevent it Why type 2 diabetes occurs This type of diabetes occurs because the body cells become insulin resistant ignoring sugar from the blood If there is too much sugar in your bloodstream for a longer period of time muscle and fat cells ignore the instructions of insulin to remove sugar from the blood and therefore more sugar accumulation in your bloodstream Under normal circumstances your pancreas produces enough insulin to drive sugar into your cells However during the development phase of type 2 diabetes your cells ignore sugar and therefore the sugar continues to move freely in your bloodstream This forces the pancreas to produce more insulin to try to maintain normal sugar levels but fails to keep up with the long term pace The excess sugar in your body is sometimes converted and stored as cholesterol which is why most victims of this type of diabetes are overweight Inactive lifestyles smoking and poor nutrition are the most important factors associated with the development of this diabetes The disease can also be hereditary Although the disease can affect a person of any age people from the early to mid 40s have a higher risk of getting this condition What it is like on a daily basis for people with type 2 diabetes People with type 2 diabetes https www howwebs com 2018 11 Type 2 Diabetes Symptoms Diabetes Health How Webs United States USA html have the highest risk of increased hunger fatigue numbness of the hands and feet excessive thirst and the urge to urinate frequently Blurred vision weight loss and slow cure for infections other symptoms that people with diabetes have These symptoms develop gradually so that some people will not notice the change in life and will not even know that they are suffering from this condition This condition is progressive and can have devastating consequences if it is not checked in time Over time high levels of sugar in the bloodstream can cause damage to small blood vessels and optic nerves kidneys or worse the heart Large arteries run a high risk of hardening which can lead to heart failure and stroke Frequent urination can lead to excessive loss of water in the body causing it to dry out The kidneys are also forced to work harder so they can fail In the worst condition type 2 diabetes can lead to organ failure causing amputation Keeping on taking medication is a struggle that people with type 2 diabetes must endure every day for the rest of their lives Treatment for type 2 diabetes If you a family member or a friend are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes you will be happy to know that there are treatment methods that can control or even reverse the condition Diet and training treatment The first way to treat type 2 diabetes is to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep your body fit By exercising your body consumes a lot of energy hence the need to process more sugar If more sugar is processed there will be no excess sugar in your blood When it comes to dieting avoid high protein and fat intake and make complex carbohydrates a large part of your meals instead Such carbohydrates include whole grains potatoes and pasta You should also regularly take meals in small amounts to ensure a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream If you maintain a healthy lifestyle you can easily fight the disease without using drugs Medication approach and management of type 2 diabetes https www howwebs com 2018 12 diabetes management nurse training html Although the above treatment approach is simple and easy to follow it may not be certain whether it will work hence the need for medication Medications are usually given to help the body respond more quickly to insulin Below are some of the drugs that people must take to survive if they have type 2 diabetes Metformin andquot This medicine works by reducing the amount of sugar released by the liver and reducing sugar absorption in the digestive tract This automatically lowers blood sugar levels and

and other health problems you may have Finding the ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes may require medical advice You may need to combine different medicines to control your disease Do you have to keep using the above medication for a lifetime Is it possible to reverse type 2 diabetes Well there are some programs designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who treat the condition naturally Such a program is The Big Diabetes Lie The Big Diabetes Lie This is a 456 page book written by Max Sidorov and The International Council for Truth in Medicine ICTM It contains strategies for naturally reversing type 2 diabetes If you have diabetes the book promises to free you from drug slavery through a procedural health guide called The 7 Steps to Healthy and the Big Diabetes Lie How it works The program informs users about everything that has to do with type 2 diabetes how it develops and how to combat it With this program they learn about the adjustments they can make to their lifestyle to protect them against not only type 2 diabetes but also against other diseases The program asks the reader the question do your current food choices keep you diabetic Some of the lessons that will be learned from this book include healthy food and the avoidable choice of vitamins distinguishing healthy fats from the unhealthy and how among other things to reduce the craving for food The book also teaches you how to maintain the correct PH level to make your body unfriendly to diseases such as cancer In general the guide emphasizes healthy eating and lifestyle routines as the key to controlling and even reversing type 2 diabetes and preventing an attack by other diseases The Big Diabetes Lie claims that the pharmaceutical industry is out to exploit the people living with type 2 diabetes Based on the authors argument the industry is running for profit by selling drugs that they know cannot fully treat Type 2 Diabetes but insist that one cannot survive without their use The major pharmaceutical companies are afraid that other successful approaches will affect their business results and bankrupt them According to the authors drugs treat symptoms instead of removing the cause of the disease and cause even more life threatening side effects compared to those of the disease itself This is evident in the medicines mentioned above because none of them lacks a side effect Why it is successful Unlike the drugs that only address the symptoms of type 2 diabetes this program addresses the cause of the problem to free the patient forever It teaches you how to reverse type 2 diabetes naturally Medicines are only intended to benefit the pharmaceutical industry The guide also uses natural strategies and does not cause any adverse consequences for the user The program has worked for thousands of people around the world and perhaps your solution Conclusion All in all type 2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disease Although there are other factors a poor lifestyle is the main culprit Informing people about this disease is the first step to combat it How do we inform the victims and prevent others from being diagnosed Understanding everything about the situation is the key The above guide sketches practically everything about this disease There must be public awareness of what people should eat how they should exercise control their weight and change their lifestyle Most people have a hectic life and have little or no time to exercise To make matters worse they consume junk food in large quantities making them easy prey for type 2 diabetes With proper training on observing a healthy lifestyle type 2 diabetes can become a thing of the past This can be the breakthrough of diabetes that saves your life</td>\n",

I’m sorry your child has diabetes.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry my uninformed opinion — about a man in a restaurant who was checking his blood sugar and administering life-saving insulin before his meal — was hurtful. I was unaware. I was not being intentionally hateful.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m repenting for my mistake by using what happened as a teaching moment to help raise awareness about this cruel disease, [**as many on Twitter hoped I would**](https://twitter.com/Diabetes_DRI/status/1146780153420402694). Please know, I wasn’t intentionally trying to perpetuate misinformation. Please understand, my views reflected a lack of understanding about this incurable disease. That is why my comment struck a nerve and went viral. I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry I didn’t understand anything about Type 1 diabetes (T1D), which often occurs in children. Those with diabetes have a pancreas that does not make enough insulin. Blood testing, oral medications and injections become a way of life. Forever. I did know about Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, because some of my friends and family have it.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry I was woefully uninformed about what people living with diabetes go though, especially those with T1D, to stay alive. I’ve learned some must check blood sugar multiple times a day, and calculate correct doses of insulin based on calorie and carbs immediately before eating. I didn’t know that. I am thankful I don’t have diabetes or have to do that.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I have learned so much. More than 100 million Americans now live with diabetes, according to [**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/reports/reportcard.html). It’s good news that diabetes in adults has decreased, but sad and discouraging that it is on the rise for children. I can’t image how hard it must be for parents to manage this disease in young children. I’m blessed I don’t have to.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry parents have to teach their beautiful children with T1D to endure repeated needle pricks, to have no shame when it comes to testing blood sugar and to learn how to give themselves insulin shots before meals or snacks when in a restaurant, airplane, stadium or any public space. [**It is your right to manage your condition openly, anywhere, and in any place**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html). “People with diabetes have the right to participate fully in our society without sacrificing their medical safety or facing discrimination because of misunderstandings, fears, and stereotypes about diabetes,” according to the American Diabetes Association.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry that, before dashing an off-the-cuff opinion based on an emotional reaction on [**Let’s Eat South Florida**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/letseatsouthflorida/), I didn’t educate myself by visiting the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation at [**DiabetesResearch.org**](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__www.diabetesresearch.org_%26d%3DCwMFaQ%26c%3Dy2w-uYmhgFWijp_IQN0DhA%26r%3D8L2QR-YsbRfJPRpEthsVg_SZwcMRtUJg1T_XGDIFJIY%26m%3D92YS5pMszBmPh_bYKtAtTX5-ZrHyJaIeiOH1NhzS-Qs%26s%3D7ZdwHKg-L3i64-8rOdmZ5A_KTQVZhgmGYsxqjwAXyMg%26e%3D&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdchristensen%40sunsentinel.com%7C6efb625dbaea41cdecd108d6ffe9a05f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636977776228408544&amp;amp;sdata=KrKdiZVJiGmQogKPWCQ4v4RYzeijVzfATJBzWXrjVGQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0), the American Association of Diabetes Educators at[ **Diabeteseducator.org**](http://diabeteseducator.org/), the Centers for Disease Control at [**CDC.gov/diabetes**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/education.html), the American Diabetes Foundation at [**Diabetes.org**](http://www.diabetes.org/) or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at [**JDRF.org**](https://www.jdrf.org/). Many of these organizations kindly offered to assist and educate me, and I thank them for that. As a journalist, I understand I have a responsibility to the truth, and I take that extremely seriously. But I also have opinions and views as a human, separate from my job. My comments were made in that capacity, a Jane Q. Citizen. But, alas, where does being a journalist begin and end when it comes to these sorts of things? It was not my wish to reflect badly upon my newspaper, colleagues, family or friends. Or, to become an internet pinata. For the record, the Sun Sentinel did not order me to apologize or write this column, nor did it threaten my job.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry some people think those with diabetes should test and administer insulin in a public restroom. I did not suggest that, as many incorrectly attributed to me. I do understand that a filthy bathroom can be a dangerous place to self-dose. There was equal outrage about my suggestion of going to the car. [**People with diabetes say they have a right to shameless public displays of diabetes**](https://insulinnation.com/treatment/shameless-public-displays-of-diabetes/), according to an enlightening post on InsulinNation.com.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry my opinion helped [**perpetuate stigma and shame**](https://www.diabetesdaily.com/blog/2013/07/the-stigma-of-diabetes/), leading some, *especially*children, to hide their condition. I’ve learned this can develop into poor management because people wait to treat until they are in a private space. That’s dangerous and puts their health at serious risk. Many members of the diabetes community have educated me about the hell they go though to live. I thank them for sharing their gut-wrenching stories with me. I wish they didn’t have this sadistic disease.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry this disease could result in the loss of limbs, eyesight, causes diabetic heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, high blood pressure, nerve damage and other medical complications. How utterly awful that must be to lose a foot, leg, or your life, or have to endure regular, painful [**dialysis as kidneys begin to fail**](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/diabetes).  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry life-sustaining insulin can cost thousands of dollars a month. [**It’s wrong that companies are trying to make a profit off millions of humans who need his medication to live**](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-op-edit-drug-pricing-nat-scandal-20190319-story.html#nt=instory-link). “As many as one in every five Americans are trying to cope with Big Pharma’s morally indefensible pricing schemes by leaving prescriptions unfilled, skipping doses or splitting pills,” according to an editorial the Sun Sentinel recently published.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry people often fat- and food-shame those living with diabetes for what they eat and for \"not maintaining a healthy diet.” It’s nobody’s business what anyone eats or how diabetes is managed.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry low or high blood sugar can kill or cause a coma from insulin shock because medicine wasn’t dosed correctly or taken on time, or because of shame.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry some members of the diabetes community felt it was OK to bully, harass and threaten me, my family and friends on social media. I received death threats, was subjected to abusive language, and have been relentlessly trolled by hundreds of members of the diabetes community for days. That’s not OK. Emails and Facebook messages were sent to the Sun Sentinel demanding I be fired for my opinion (that’s my job). Some kind souls were ashamed of this behavior and warned me I wasn’t safe. I thank them for that. Others sent emails to help educate me. Thanks for that.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;Others, not so much. “I saw your post about someone taking literally life saving insulin in a restaurant and that you thought it was “gross,” wrote Kristen Hohmann in an email. “I can only hope someone or everyone you love or you directly discover an entirely unprovoked genetic illness that destroys your ability to live life as a normal person and have to do something like that to stay alive. I hope you die in a fire you ignorant bitch.”  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;More said they hoped I would die from a diabetic coma. Scads of others called me vile, unpublishable names on my personal [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217244351173136&amp;amp;set=a.2749052177793&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater) and [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/doreenchristensen/?hl=en) accounts. No matter how offensive some thought my comments were, they had no right to threaten bodily harm. That’s not OK.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I contacted administrators of Facebook diabetes groups and asked them to moderate member comments that advocated harassing me online. They assured me they would, and they have. I thank them for that, and trust the diabetes community will police itself and speak out against such dangerous mob mentality.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry some think my opinion was discrimination. It was not. I didn’t not violate anyone’s rights by having an *opinion*. I took no action. My speech and this column is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Those out there who disagree with me and others — who also happen to have diabetes — have the right to express their opinions. I celebrate and welcome that. My comments did not violate the Americans With Disability Act. I did not violate any law. There is no need to report me to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as some on Twitter advocated. If people with diabetes are truly discriminated against, they can call [**ADA legal advocates at 800-342-2383**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html). Know your rights.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry I couldn’t make larger donations to the American Diabetes Foundation at [**Diabetes.org**](http://www.diabetes.org/) and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation at [**JDRF.org**](https://www.jdrf.org/) to repent for my insensitive comments. I dedicated my contributions to all those who have died from the disease. I know my money will help further diabetes education and research, but mostly, to one day find a cure.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;I’m sorry diabetes sucks.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPersonally, I would love to scream at this woman.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Apologies in advance for the length, I just need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nThree years ago I weighed 310lbs and was starting to feel very ill. I was thirsty all the time, constantly peeing, and just overall not well. Before my symptoms started I knew I was unhealthy. I was a morbidly obese 27 year old woman. I'd tried dieting and exercise so many times and couldn't manage to lose weight. I was so hungry all. the. time. I couldn't get enough food, nothing satisfied me. I was very down on myself and depressed for all of my early 20s (not all of this was weight related, had some family trauma, a string of awful boyfriends, etc.). I ignored my symptoms for months telling myself it was all obesity related and I brought this on myself. \\n\\nWell, finally, the thing I'd always dreamed of happened. I started losing weight without changing my diet. I was joking with my coworkers about my new \"super power\" but inside I knew something was really wrong. When I lost 40lbs in one month, I finally made an appointment with my doctor (had to find a new doctor because at that point I'd last been seen by my pediatrician) got the blood work done, and received a Type 2 diagnosis. I was prescribed Metformin and Glimipiride. My a1c was 13.1.\\n\\nMy world was rocked. I beat myself up so much. I had done this to myself, I let myself get so fat I gave myself diabetes. It was really rough. But a little self care, and a lot of education later I learned that that's not true, and there are a lot of factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes. (Although, I have to admit while I outwardly preached this I did still blame my obesity and the way I treated my body for my diagnosis.)\\n\\nI did a lot of research and ignored my diabetes educator in lieu of internet experts (eye roll) and started a very strict keto diet. Within thee months I'd brought my a1c down to 5.3. I was my doctor's favorite patient. I felt better than I ever have in my life (though, if I'm being honest, still not 100%). For what felt like the first time My friends and family were so proud of me. I was the diabetes wonder child! My insurance stopped covering the 4X a day test strips I was receiving at this time, and I SO STUPIDLY stopped checking my blood sugar.\\n\\n It took about a year and I lost a total of 135lbs. I've weighed 175lbs for the past 2 years, and as a 5'8 female I've been mostly ok with that. Another 20lbs and I'll be at what's considered a healthy weight, but I still really prefer this body (loose skin, stretch marks and all!) over my previous 300+lbs body. \\n\\nThe reason I stopped losing weight is probably because I became a lot more lax on the keto diet. I never went back to drinking any sugary drinks, but more carbs slowly crept back into my life. I let myself have french fries occasionally, then maybe some Taco Bell, then a slice of cake on my birthday, a piece of pecan pie on Thanksgiving. For about 6 months I ate a keto diet probably 50% of the time. \\n\\nMeanwhile, my a1c was climbing higher and higher. My doctor was lecturing me (the reason I avoided the doctor for 10 years prior) and trying different medications. Then last October I was laid off from my job of 6 years. I completely gave up on myself and didn't care about myself, and fell into a depression, completely devoid of fucks to give. \\n\\nI scheduled a doctor's appointment before my insurance ran out and at that time my a1c was 9.2. Luckily, I was able to find a new, better, job fairly quickly but once you go off the rails it's hard to get back on track. I was eating so poorly, lots of fast food, sneaking lots of packaged sweets behind my fiance's back, but still pretending I was eating keto most of the time. (Why did I think it was ok to eat 12 oreos but still deny myself like fruit, yogurt, and whole wheat bread???)\\n\\nAnyway, to make an already way too long story short- about two weeks ago I started having symptoms of what I thought was acid reflux. Lots of heartburn, that burning gut feeling, etc. I was in SUCH denial. I knew what DKA was. I was constantly hungry and thirsty like when I was fat. I was practically guzzling Zantac and Tums. WHY DIDN'T I CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR??\\n\\nThen last Thursday, April 25th,  I started having trouble breathing. I left work, went home and took a nap. I asked my fiance to bring me frozen yogurt as I thought it would soothe my stomach. It did but he begged me to go to the doctor. I told him I was fine and I just needed to sleep. I sent him to go play on his PC and even joked to him \"You're going to be so sad if I die\" (just the kind of awful, dark humor that I have) He was like \"why the fuck would you say that??\"\\n\\nThe next morning I went to work. My fiance begged me to call out and go to the doctor. I was still struggling to breathe. I was at work for two hours before they forced me to go to a walk-in. I insisted on driving myself. \\n\\nAt the walk-in I KNOW I filled out all my paperwork correctly, stating that I was (to my knowledge at the time) Type 2 diabetic. I told them I was having acid reflux like symptoms. They insisted I was having a panic attack. I told them no, I know what a panic attack feels like, this wasn't it. I just wanted to breathe normally again. They kept insisting, brought multiple doctors in, and finally decided to run an EKG because of the family history of heart issues I have. \\n\\nThat's when I had an actual panic attack. Luckily, it came back clear. They sent me home with a prescription for a one-a-day acid reflux medication and some generic form of xanax. I went and got the prescription filled but started feeling a lot worse. I sent my fiance some really loopy texts. He begged me to call someone close by to come get me. I told him I was fine but was starting to get really loopy. I managed to make it home after stopping for more frozen yogurt. \\n\\nThe last thing I remember from that Friday is my fiance calling, and me telling him I made it home safe and not to worry. \\n\\nHe found me passed out on the living room floor. I wasn't wearing pants. My phone was by the sink, my purse upstairs, I don't know what was going through my mind. I had pooped myself. My body was shutting down. That night they told my mom and my fiance that they didn't know if I was going to make it.\\n\\nI woke up in the ICU, bruised to all hell. I spent 4 days receiving amazing care where every Endo who came to see me was certain that I was actually a Type 1 and in complete disbelief that I hadn't been diagnosed sooner. \\n\\nFriday I went to my diabetes education where my nurse practitioner confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis. It's been a real rollercoaster of emotions. \\n\\nMy outer body is still very sore and bruised but I can already tell I feel so much better being on insulin this past week. Emotionally, it's been hard too. I feel so bad for what I put my parents and fiance through. My poor dad flew all the way across the country not knowing if I was going to live or die. They all want to sue the walk-in clinic for not checking my blood sugar but I just blame myself.\\n\\nAnyway, I feel like I have a million questions but the ones that come to mind right now are:\\n\\n*How do you guys handle alcohol? Can I still drink? What about marijuana? They don't teach you about this in diabetes education class\\n\\n*Do you all actually stick to the recommended 60g of carbs per meal? Do you just learn how to take more insulin? I'm getting married next year and want to do the cake tasting! I also have a huge sweet tooth and have just been so frightened of anything sweet.\\n\\n*Pizza. What do?\\n\\n*I'm supposed to take my lantus at 9pm every night, what if I'm seeing a movie or something?\\n\\n*I'm seeing the endo next week. They said I would probably be set up with a CGM and a pump. If I have a choice, is this a good option? Which are the best? General tips and tricks are welcome. \\n\\nI think I'll leave it there and save the rest of my questions for my Endo but any general words of advice are sooo welcome. \\n\\nOne last thought- I watch Fellowship of the Ring yesterday since that's always been one of my comfort movies. When Frodo says \"I wish the ring never came to me. I wish none of this had happened\" and Gandalf gives the famous line \"So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" I. fucking. lost. it. I could not stop crying. Of course, that line is repeated later on in the movie so I lost it twice. I also lost it when Frodo is stabbed on Weathertop and almost dies because it just really hit close to home more than ever.\\n\\nAnyway, if you read that whole thing- bless you. Thank you so much for letting me get that off my chest.\\n\\ntl;dr CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was just diagnosed T1 after suffering DKA at age 30 and I m just freaking out a little bit Apologies in advance for the length I just need to get this off my chest Three years ago I weighed 310lbs and was starting to feel very ill I was thirsty all the time constantly peeing and just overall not well Before my symptoms started I knew I was unhealthy I was a morbidly obese 27 year old woman I d tried dieting and exercise so many times and couldn t manage to lose weight I was so hungry all the time I couldn t get enough food nothing satisfied me I was very down on myself and depressed for all of my early 20s not all of this was weight related had some family trauma a string of awful boyfriends etc I ignored my symptoms for months telling myself it was all obesity related and I brought this on myself Well finally the thing I d always dreamed of happened I started losing weight without changing my diet I was joking with my coworkers about my new super power but inside I knew something was really wrong When I lost 40lbs in one month I finally made an appointment with my doctor had to find a new doctor because at that point I d last been seen by my pediatrician got the blood work done and received a Type 2 diagnosis I was prescribed Metformin and Glimipiride My a1c was 13 1 My world was rocked I beat myself up so much I had done this to myself I let myself get so fat I gave myself diabetes It was really rough But a little self care and a lot of education later I learned that that s not true and there are a lot of factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes Although I have to admit while I outwardly preached this I did still blame my obesity and the way I treated my body for my diagnosis I did a lot of research and ignored my diabetes educator in lieu of internet experts eye roll and started a very strict keto diet Within thee months I d brought my a1c down to 5 3 I was my doctor s favorite patient I felt better than I ever have in my life though if I m being honest still not 100 For what felt like the first time My friends and family were so proud of me I was the diabetes wonder child My insurance stopped covering the 4X a day test strips I was receiving at this time and I SO STUPIDLY stopped checking my blood sugar It took about a year and I lost a total of 135lbs I ve weighed 175lbs for the past 2 years and as a 5 8 female I ve been mostly ok with that Another 20lbs and I ll be at what s considered a healthy weight but I still really prefer this body loose skin stretch marks and all over my previous 300 lbs body The reason I stopped losing weight is probably because I became a lot more lax on the keto diet I never went back to drinking any sugary drinks but more carbs slowly crept back into my life I let myself have french fries occasionally then maybe some Taco Bell then a slice of cake on my birthday a piece of pecan pie on Thanksgiving For about 6 months I ate a keto diet probably 50 of the time Meanwhile my a1c was climbing higher and higher My doctor was lecturing me the reason I avoided the doctor for 10 years prior and trying different medications Then last October I was laid off from my job of 6 years I completely gave up on myself and didn t care about myself and fell into a depression completely devoid of fucks to give I scheduled a doctor s appointment before my insurance ran out and at that time my a1c was 9 2 Luckily I was able to find a new better job fairly quickly but once you go off the rails it s hard to get back on track I was eating so poorly lots of fast food sneaking lots of packaged sweets behind my fiance s back but still pretending I was eating keto most of the time Why did I think it was ok to eat 12 oreos but still deny myself like fruit yogurt and whole wheat bread Anyway to make an already way too long story short about two weeks ago I started having symptoms of what I thought was acid reflux Lots of heartburn that burning gut feeling etc I was in SUCH denial I knew what DKA was I was constantly hungry and thirsty like when I was fat I was practically guzzling Zantac and Tums WHY DIDN T I CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR Then last Thursday April 25th I started having trouble breathing I left work went home and took a nap I asked my fiance to bring me frozen yogurt as I thought it would soothe my stomach It did but he begged me to go to the doctor I told him I was fine and I just needed to sleep I sent him to go play on his PC and even joked to him You re going to be so sad if I die just the kind of awful dark humor that I have He was like why the fuck would you say that The next morning I went to work My fiance begged me to call out and go to the doctor I was still struggling to breathe I was at work for two hours before they forced me to go to a walk in I insisted on driving myself At the walk in I KNOW I filled out all my paperwork correctly stating that I was to my knowledge at the time Type 2 diabetic I told them I was having acid reflux like symptoms They insisted I was having a panic attack I told them no I know what a panic attack feels like this wasn t it I just wanted to breathe normally again They kept insisting brought multiple doctors in and finally decided to run an EKG because of the family history of heart issues I have That s when I had an actual panic attack Luckily it came back clear They sent me home with a prescription for a one a day acid reflux medication and some generic form of xanax I went and got the prescription filled but started feeling a lot worse I sent my fiance some really loopy texts He begged me to call someone close by to come get me I told him I was fine but was starting to get really loopy I managed to make it home after stopping for more frozen yogurt The last thing I remember from that Friday is my fiance calling and me telling him I made it home safe and not to worry He found me passed out on the living room floor I wasn t wearing pants My phone was by the sink my purse upstairs I don t know what was going through my mind I had pooped myself My body was shutting down That night they told my mom and my fiance that they didn t know if I was going to make it I woke up in the ICU bruised to all hell I spent 4 days receiving amazing care where every Endo who came to see me was certain that I was actually a Type 1 and in complete disbelief that I hadn t been diagnosed sooner Friday I went to my diabetes education where my nurse practitioner confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis It s been a real rollercoaster of emotions My outer body is still very sore and bruised but I can already tell I feel so much better being on insulin this past week Emotionally it s been hard too I feel so bad for what I put my parents and fiance through My poor dad flew all the way across the country not knowing if I was going to live or die They all want to sue the walk in clinic for not checking my blood sugar but I just blame myself Anyway I feel like I have a million questions but the ones that come to mind right now are How do you guys handle alcohol Can I still drink What about marijuana They don t teach you about this in diabetes education class Do you all actually stick to the recommended 60g of carbs per meal Do you just learn how to take more insulin I m getting married next year and want to do the cake tasting I also have a huge sweet tooth and have just been so frightened of anything sweet Pizza What do I m supposed to take my lantus at 9pm every night what if I m seeing a movie or something I m seeing the endo next week They said I would probably be set up with a CGM and a pump If I have a choice is this a good option Which are the best General tips and tricks are welcome I think I ll leave it there and save the rest of my questions for my Endo but any general words of advice are sooo welcome One last thought I watch Fellowship of the Ring yesterday since that s always been one of my comfort movies When Frodo says I wish the ring never came to me I wish none of this had happened and Gandalf gives the famous line So do all who live to see such times But that is not for them to decide All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us I fucking lost it I could not stop crying Of course that line is repeated later on in the movie so I lost it twice I also lost it when Frodo is stabbed on Weathertop and almost dies because it just really hit close to home more than ever Anyway if you read that whole thing bless you Thank you so much for letting me get that off my chest tl dr CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR</td>\n",

       "      <td>Conquering your inner “It.”\\nBeating Diabetes Burnout\\n\\n   We’ve all experienced it. “Maybe if I ignore it, act like it doesn’t exist, it will go away.” Whether your “it” is a class you’re failing, your clingy girlfriend or your autoimmune disease that you are required to maintain every day, we all have our own “it.” But what happens when the burden that you chose to ignore, doesn’t care whether you want it to exist or not? Is the effort you exert really worth the life you will lead to live? Or are you so arrogant that you believe you are the one that, “Beats the Odds,” as they say?  Let me take you through the journey of my own “It.” A little thing my endocrinologist calls, “Diabetes Burnout.”\\n\\n   ‘BRR BRR’ Your cellphone is vibrating for the 27th time today because you didn’t show up for your 7 o’clock dinner date last night with your girl. It’s only been three months since you decided, “to take things serious,” as the kids call it these days. ‘We’re done, all guys are the same and you are no different,’ the new text notification says. Mission Accomplished, no more girl holding you down, nobody to tell you what to do. Simple right? Just ignore the text and go about your life, happy and care free. Now, what if there were no text messages? What if, you missed the date, but when you get home the next day after a long day at work, she’s still there acting like nothing ever happened. Better yet, she’s already setting up your next date, and you already know you’re going to skip that one too. Welcome to the life of a Type One diabetic. Whether it’s not checking your sugar or not giving yourself the insulin required for the cookie you just snuck by, no matter how much you ignore it, diabetes isn’t going tell you “we’re done.” She’s locked in and ready for the long haul. “Until Death Do Us Part,” but what I had failed to realize was Death was on my doorstep and this marriage between my diabetes and myself was on a crash course to an abrupt end. \\n\\n   First, let me take you down the “Highway to Hell,” that I was on with my diabetes. I was done. I was defeated and I no longer felt like the hand I was dealt, was the hand I was supposed to hold. To this day I remember the look on my mom’s face, and the tears in my dad’s eyes when the ER nurse looked at me and said, “Your life as you know it, is over.” Now, I don’t believe the nurse was attempting to be malicious or rude at that moment, but the life of a typical 17 year old who is attempting to fit in with all of his buddies, isn’t a life that a Type 1 diabetic should live. Well, for me anyway. “We’ll do this together,” I can still hear my dad saying to me. To my dad’s credit, he tried. We ate the same food, followed the same carb ratio and tried to work as a team to ‘defeat’ this nasty beast. However, what I didn’t know was after I’d go to sleep, dad would go and sneak a peanut butter sandwich. (Sneaky man he is.) In a 17 year olds brain, if your dad can’t do it, nobody can. That was my mindset. I tried to stay strong. I tried to keep up with the charity walks, and mentoring newly diagnosed diabetics, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking, “Damn, if dad can’t do this, superman can’t and if superman can’t, I damn sure can’t.” It became easier to bring that thought to the forefront of my brain, and my diabetes wellness on the backburner. It became easier to make up fictional number when my mom asked me what my blood sugar was then to take the work and go check it. Hell, it came easier to eat my lunch and go have a beer with the buddies, ignoring the fact that I need to take insulin. But why would I do all of these? For what, so I could live a couple years longer? Why did God deal all of this extra work to a kid who’s never really done any extra work? I could still go and socialize with my buddies. I could still go hang out in a parking lot until 3 a.m. and get up the next day and be totally fine, without dealing with my stupid diabetes. Why is my endocrinologist stressing to me to get things under control? He doesn’t understand! I’m living the life right now and I’ll be damned if I take time out of my day to tend to a disease that will affect me down the road. I’m living in the NOW! Boy, was that a mistake. \\n   \\n   After so many years of ignoring my responsibilities I was dealt, I developed an arrogance with myself. Maybe I’m the exception, maybe my health isn’t as bad as everyone keeps saying. I mean, they don’t know me. They don’t know how I feel. I feel great, at least that’s what I kept telling myself. So what, maybe I do sleep until 11:30 in the morning, waking up feeling groggy and ready to go back to sleep. Yeah, so what if my body feels dehydrated, I still woke up today. Diabetes couldn’t touch me. I’m Brandon freakin’ Leasure. I’m better than this, I’m better than some stupid disease. Looking back, I became the person that I was raised to avoid. I became arrogant. Yeah, I’d still hold the door for the next person, or refer to everyone as ma’am or sir, I wasn’t arrogant towards other people. I was arrogant towards myself and that’s the most dangerous arrogance you can obtain. For these purposes, we’ll call the arrogance towards other people, “Social Arrogance,” and arrogance towards yourself, “Self Arrogance.” Just as a social arrogant person would do to their peers, I stuck my nose up to the signs my body was telling me. It’s like, if you’re arrogant to your peers, one of these days, you’re going to catch a right hook right to the chin. It’s the exact same if you’re a “Self-Arrogant.” Except, I didn’t catch a right hook to the chin, I caught a one way ticket to the bathroom floor in the ER vomiting so violently, I couldn’t move. \\n\\n   Wow, how did this happen. How in the hell did I, Brandon freakin’ Leasure, wind up here. I mean, I was the poster boy. Everyone on the outside would tell me how proud of me they were, how I took diabetes and, “Kicked its ass.” I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be weak and vulnerable. At least, that’s what I told myself. To better understand the level of “self-arrogance” I had established, let me take you to the day my world came crashing down. It was a normal morning, I had gotten up, ate some cereal and was preparing to start my work for the day. (I worked from home.) But as I was setting up my day, I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t feel all too good and I knew a date to the toilet bowl was inevitable. Now, being an uncontrolled diabetic, puking was nothing to me. I figured I’d puke, feel better, and be a couple minutes late to logging in for work and all would be fine in the world. Except that’s not what happened. One puke turned into three, which turned into 4, which eventually ended up at 7 trips to the toilet bowl that morning. I couldn’t move. I worked up enough energy to climb back in bed and did what every boy does, I called my mom. Now after that phone call, I don’t remember much of anything, until I woke up on the floor of the ER Bathroom. Finally, I was taken into a room and immediately placed on fluids. To this point, I was good. Just another 3 day trip in the hospital and out I’d be ready to go back to my normal life. What I didn’t know, was this was the day my world would be flipped upside down. My parent’s had had enough of my way of living. They showed me tough love that day in the hospital and I earned my fair share of bedside lectures from my mom, dad and my fierce little grandmother. It was the talk I had with my grandmother, Mamaw as we call her, that really opened my eyes. She looked at me that day, and asked me the one question I wasn’t ready for. “Why?” Why was I in this hospital bed, what was so bad in my life that I ran away from all the responsibilities of my health to end up here. That one word, that one simple word, changed my life. \\n\\n   That day, I realized that Diabetes isn’t something you can just ignore and it will go away. If you ignore it too long, it will put you away. \\n\\n   The next few weeks entailed some crucial life changes that have helped me become the man I am today. I called off a wedding that was supposed to happen in 6 weeks. I decided to relinquish my rights to work from home, putting myself on a schedule. I removed all of the negative impacts that I had in my life the day I wound up on that bathroom floor. The beautiful thing is no matter how long it took me to acquire all of these negative influences, it took no time to remove them. Everything about my life is healthier now. I’m in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who doesn’t try to dictate my health, but encourages me to be the best diabetic I can be. With that beautiful woman came an eccentric two year old step daughter, who doesn’t see the diabetes, but sees a man who’s trying to be the best he can be, and she holds me accountable, whether she realizes it or not. I have an amazing relationship with my parents, better than I ever have before. But, the biggest thing that’s pulled me out of my Diabetic Burnout, is I’ve became what I like to call a, “First Responder Diabetic.” What I mean by that is, I no longer run away from my disease or the community that this disease has brought together, I want to run head first into it. \\n\\n   In closing, I’d just like to say this. You’re not alone. There is help out there, don’t be ashamed to use it. Don’t let your “Self-Arrogance” be the reason you end up on the bathroom floor in the local ER. You are valuable and you bring your own uniqueness to the table, don’t let a disease that is 100% manageable keep you from that. I think we all have a little, “Diabetic First Responder,” in us and we all can help each other with our everyday struggles. Diabetic Burnout is a pain in the ass, but I know you can dig yourself out of it, because I did. \\n\\n-\\tBrandon Leasure \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I don t really know what this is Just me a word document and my story Conquering your inner It Beating Diabetes Burnout We ve all experienced it Maybe if I ignore it act like it doesn t exist it will go away Whether your it is a class you re failing your clingy girlfriend or your autoimmune disease that you are required to maintain every day we all have our own it But what happens when the burden that you chose to ignore doesn t care whether you want it to exist or not Is the effort you exert really worth the life you will lead to live Or are you so arrogant that you believe you are the one that Beats the Odds as they say Let me take you through the journey of my own It A little thing my endocrinologist calls Diabetes Burnout BRR BRR Your cellphone is vibrating for the 27th time today because you didn t show up for your 7 o clock dinner date last night with your girl It s only been three months since you decided to take things serious as the kids call it these days We re done all guys are the same and you are no different the new text notification says Mission Accomplished no more girl holding you down nobody to tell you what to do Simple right Just ignore the text and go about your life happy and care free Now what if there were no text messages What if you missed the date but when you get home the next day after a long day at work she s still there acting like nothing ever happened Better yet she s already setting up your next date and you already know you re going to skip that one too Welcome to the life of a Type One diabetic Whether it s not checking your sugar or not giving yourself the insulin required for the cookie you just snuck by no matter how much you ignore it diabetes isn t going tell you we re done She s locked in and ready for the long haul Until Death Do Us Part but what I had failed to realize was Death was on my doorstep and this marriage between my diabetes and myself was on a crash course to an abrupt end First let me take you down the Highway to Hell that I was on with my diabetes I was done I was defeated and I no longer felt like the hand I was dealt was the hand I was supposed to hold To this day I remember the look on my mom s face and the tears in my dad s eyes when the ER nurse looked at me and said Your life as you know it is over Now I don t believe the nurse was attempting to be malicious or rude at that moment but the life of a typical 17 year old who is attempting to fit in with all of his buddies isn t a life that a Type 1 diabetic should live Well for me anyway We ll do this together I can still hear my dad saying to me To my dad s credit he tried We ate the same food followed the same carb ratio and tried to work as a team to defeat this nasty beast However what I didn t know was after I d go to sleep dad would go and sneak a peanut butter sandwich Sneaky man he is In a 17 year olds brain if your dad can t do it nobody can That was my mindset I tried to stay strong I tried to keep up with the charity walks and mentoring newly diagnosed diabetics but in the back of my mind I kept thinking Damn if dad can t do this superman can t and if superman can t I damn sure can t It became easier to bring that thought to the forefront of my brain and my diabetes wellness on the backburner It became easier to make up fictional number when my mom asked me what my blood sugar was then to take the work and go check it Hell it came easier to eat my lunch and go have a beer with the buddies ignoring the fact that I need to take insulin But why would I do all of these For what so I could live a couple years longer Why did God deal all of this extra work to a kid who s never really done any extra work I could still go and socialize with my buddies I could still go hang out in a parking lot until 3 a m and get up the next day and be totally fine without dealing with my stupid diabetes Why is my endocrinologist stressing to me to get things under control He doesn t understand I m living the life right now and I ll be damned if I take time out of my day to tend to a disease that will affect me down the road I m living in the NOW Boy was that a mistake After so many years of ignoring my responsibilities I was dealt I developed an arrogance with myself Maybe I m the exception maybe my health isn t as bad as everyone keeps saying I mean they don t know me They don t know how I feel I feel great at least that s what I kept telling myself So what maybe I do sleep until 11 30 in the morning waking up feeling groggy and ready to go back to sleep Yeah so what if my body feels dehydrated I still woke up today Diabetes couldn t touch me I m Brandon freakin Leasure I m better than this I m better than some stupid disease Looking back I became the person that I was raised to avoid I became arrogant Yeah I d still hold the door for the next person or refer to everyone as ma am or sir I wasn t arrogant towards other people I was arrogant towards myself and that s the most dangerous arrogance you can obtain For these purposes we ll call the arrogance towards other people Social Arrogance and arrogance towards yourself Self Arrogance Just as a social arrogant person would do to their peers I stuck my nose up to the signs my body was telling me It s like if you re arrogant to your peers one of these days you re going to catch a right hook right to the chin It s the exact same if you re a Self Arrogant Except I didn t catch a right hook to the chin I caught a one way ticket to the bathroom floor in the ER vomiting so violently I couldn t move Wow how did this happen How in the hell did I Brandon freakin Leasure wind up here I mean I was the poster boy Everyone on the outside would tell me how proud of me they were how I took diabetes and Kicked its ass I m not supposed to be here I m not supposed to be weak and vulnerable At least that s what I told myself To better understand the level of self arrogance I had established let me take you to the day my world came crashing down It was a normal morning I had gotten up ate some cereal and was preparing to start my work for the day I worked from home But as I was setting up my day I knew something wasn t right I didn t feel all too good and I knew a date to the toilet bowl was inevitable Now being an uncontrolled diabetic puking was nothing to me I figured I d puke feel better and be a couple minutes late to logging in for work and all would be fine in the world Except that s not what happened One puke turned into three which turned into 4 which eventually ended up at 7 trips to the toilet bowl that morning I couldn t move I worked up enough energy to climb back in bed and did what every boy does I called my mom Now after that phone call I don t remember much of anything until I woke up on the floor of the ER Bathroom Finally I was taken into a room and immediately placed on fluids To this point I was good Just another 3 day trip in the hospital and out I d be ready to go back to my normal life What I didn t know was this was the day my world would be flipped upside down My parent s had had enough of my way of living They showed me tough love that day in the hospital and I earned my fair share of bedside lectures from my mom dad and my fierce little grandmother It was the talk I had with my grandmother Mamaw as we call her that really opened my eyes She looked at me that day and asked me the one question I wasn t ready for Why Why was I in this hospital bed what was so bad in my life that I ran away from all the responsibilities of my health to end up here That one word that one simple word changed my life That day I realized that Diabetes isn t something you can just ignore and it will go away If you ignore it too long it will put you away The next few weeks entailed some crucial life changes that have helped me become the man I am today I called off a wedding that was supposed to happen in 6 weeks I decided to relinquish my rights to work from home putting myself on a schedule I removed all of the negative impacts that I had in my life the day I wound up on that bathroom floor The beautiful thing is no matter how long it took me to acquire all of these negative influences it took no time to remove them Everything about my life is healthier now I m in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who doesn t try to dictate my health but encourages me to be the best diabetic I can be With that beautiful woman came an eccentric two year old step daughter who doesn t see the diabetes but sees a man who s trying to be the best he can be and she holds me accountable whether she realizes it or not I have an amazing relationship with my parents better than I ever have before But the biggest thing that s pulled me out of my Diabetic Burnout is I ve became what I like to call a First Responder Diabetic What I mean by that is I no longer run away from my disease or the community that this disease has brought together I want to run head first into it In closing I d just like to say this You re not alone There is help out there don t be ashamed to use it Don t let your Self Arrogance be the reason you end up on the bathroom floor in the local ER You are valuable and you bring your own uniqueness to the table don t let a disease that is 100 manageable keep you from that I think we all have a little Diabetic First Responder in us and we all can help each other with our everyday struggles Diabetic Burnout is a pain in the ass but I know you can dig yourself out of it because I did Brandon Leasure</td>\n",

       "2671  This article looks at how you can reverse type 2 diabetes naturally.\\n\\nDiabetes is one of the most popular diseases in people around the world. It is a condition that makes your blood sugar level higher than normal. Diabetes can be divided into Type 1 and Type Diabetes, the latter being the most common.\\n\\n# What is type 2 diabetes? Important &gt;&gt; ([Complete Guide About Diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/search/label/Diabetes)) &lt;&lt;\\n\\nThis is a chronic condition that prevents your body from using the insulin it produces properly. Insulin is responsible for regulating the movement of sugar in your cells. In type 2 diabetes, instead of the body converting sugar into energy, it stores it in the bloodstream.\\n\\nThe difference between [type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-diabetes-dysfunction-and-dementia-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) and type 1 diabetes is that the latter is caused by insufficient insulin in the body due to the immune system in some people who destroy the cells that produce insulin. Unlike type 2 diabetes, a person's lifestyle does not contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, making it difficult to prevent it.\\n\\n# Why type 2 diabetes occurs\\n\\nThis type of diabetes occurs because the body cells become insulin resistant, ignoring sugar from the blood. If there is too much sugar in your bloodstream for a longer period of time, muscle and fat cells ignore the instructions of insulin to remove sugar from the blood and therefore more sugar accumulation in your bloodstream. Under normal circumstances, your pancreas produces enough insulin to drive sugar into your cells. However, during the development phase of type 2 diabetes, your cells ignore sugar and therefore the sugar continues to move freely in your bloodstream. This forces the pancreas to produce more insulin to try to maintain normal sugar levels, but fails to keep up with the long-term pace. The excess sugar in your body is sometimes converted and stored as cholesterol, which is why most victims of this type of diabetes are overweight. Inactive lifestyles, smoking, and poor nutrition are the most important factors associated with the development of this diabetes. The disease can also be hereditary. Although the disease can affect a person of any age, people from the early to mid 40s have a higher risk of getting this condition.\\n\\n# What it is like on a daily basis for people with type 2 diabetes\\n\\n[People with type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-Diabetes-Symptoms-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) have the highest risk of increased hunger, fatigue, numbness of the hands and feet, excessive thirst and the urge to urinate frequently. Blurred vision, weight loss and slow cure for infections other symptoms that people with diabetes have. These symptoms develop gradually so that some people will not notice the change in life and will not even know that they are suffering from this condition. This condition is progressive and can have devastating consequences if it is not checked in time. Over time, high levels of sugar in the bloodstream can cause damage to small blood vessels and optic nerves, kidneys, or worse the heart. Large arteries run a high risk of hardening, which can lead to heart failure and stroke. Frequent urination can lead to excessive loss of water in the body, causing it to dry out. The kidneys are also forced to work harder so they can fail. In the worst condition, type 2 diabetes can lead to organ failure, causing amputation. Keeping on taking medication is a struggle that people with type 2 diabetes must endure every day for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n# Treatment for type 2 diabetes\\n\\nIf you, a family member or a friend are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you will be happy to know that there are treatment methods that can control or even reverse the condition.\\n\\n# Diet and training treatment\\n\\nThe first way to treat type 2 diabetes is to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep your body fit. By exercising your body consumes a lot of energy, hence the need to process more sugar. If more sugar is processed, there will be no excess sugar in your blood. When it comes to dieting, avoid high protein and fat intake and make complex carbohydrates a large part of your meals instead. Such carbohydrates include whole grains, potatoes, and pasta. You should also regularly take meals in small amounts to ensure a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream. If you maintain a healthy lifestyle, you can easily fight the disease without using drugs.\\n\\n# Medication approach and [management of type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/12/diabetes-management-nurse-training.html)\\n\\nAlthough the above treatment approach is simple and easy to follow, it may not be certain whether it will work, hence the need for medication. Medications are usually given to help the body respond more quickly to insulin. Below are some of the drugs that people must take to survive if they have type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n**Metformin andquot**; This medicine works by reducing the amount of sugar released by the liver and reducing sugar absorption in the digestive tract. This automatically lowers blood sugar levels and therefore makes cells sensitive to insulin. However, this medication can cause bloating, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\\n\\n**Sulfonylureas and quot;** This medicine works by stimulating insulin production. However, they may stop working after some time, cause weight gain and abnormally lower sugar levels.\\n\\n**Biguanides survey;** These drugs work by reducing the amount of glucose in the body. The side effect of this medication includes weight loss.\\n\\n**Megalitinides survey;** These medicines are taken before meals with the aim of stimulating the production of insulin. Their impact is short-lived, although they have immediate effects. They can cause low blood sugar levels and cause you to arrive.\\n\\n**Thiazolidinediones -** These drugs work by allowing body cells to accept insulin. However, they can cause a heart attack. SGLT2 inhibitors - They work by preventing the re-uptake of sugar in the blood by preventing the kidneys from losing it in the urine. However, they can cause low blood pressure, vaginal yeast infections, diabetic ketoacidosis and urinary tract infections. Regardless of their side effects, these drugs are good for patients at risk for heart attack or stroke.\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors; They block the functionality of dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Their side effects are joint pain and pancreatitis.\\n\\nGLP-1 receptor agonists and quot; These are injections that slow down the metabolism and therefore lower the blood sugar level. They can cause weight loss, pancreatitis and nausea.\\n\\nThe decision to use medication can be influenced by various factors, including blood sugar levels and other health problems you may have. Finding the ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes may require medical advice. You may need to combine different medicines to control your disease.\\n\\nDo you have to keep using the above medication for a lifetime? Is it possible to reverse type 2 diabetes? Well, there are some programs designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who treat the condition naturally. Such a program is The Big Diabetes Lie.\\n\\nThe Big Diabetes Lie. This is a 456-page book written by Max Sidorov and The International Council for Truth in Medicine (ICTM). It contains strategies for naturally reversing type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, the book promises to free you from drug slavery through a procedural health guide called The 7 Steps to Healthy and the Big Diabetes Lie.\\n\\n# How it works\\n\\nThe program informs users about everything that has to do with type 2 diabetes, how it develops and how to combat it. With this program they learn about the adjustments they can make to their lifestyle to protect them against not only type 2 diabetes, but also against other diseases. The program asks the reader the question: do your current food choices keep you diabetic? Some of the lessons that will be learned from this book include healthy food and the avoidable, choice of vitamins, distinguishing healthy fats from the unhealthy, and how, among other things, to reduce the craving for food. The book also teaches you how to maintain the correct PH level to make your body unfriendly to diseases such as cancer. In general, the guide emphasizes healthy eating and lifestyle routines as the key to controlling and even reversing type 2 diabetes and preventing an attack by other diseases.\\n\\nThe Big Diabetes Lie claims that the pharmaceutical industry is out to exploit the people living with type 2 diabetes. Based on the authors' argument, the industry is running for profit by selling drugs that they know cannot fully treat Type 2 Diabetes, but insist that one cannot survive without their use. The major pharmaceutical companies are afraid that other successful approaches will affect their business results and bankrupt them. According to the authors, drugs treat symptoms instead of removing the cause of the disease and cause even more life-threatening side effects compared to those of the disease itself. This is evident in the medicines mentioned above because none of them lacks a side effect.\\n\\n# Why it is successful\\n\\nUnlike the drugs that only address the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, this program addresses the cause of the problem to free the patient forever. It teaches you how to reverse type 2 diabetes naturally. Medicines are only intended to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. The guide also uses natural strategies and does not cause any adverse consequences for the user. The program has worked for thousands of people around the world and perhaps your solution.\\n\\nConclusion All in all, type 2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disease. Although there are other factors, a poor lifestyle is the main culprit. Informing people about this disease is the first step to combat it. How do we inform the victims and prevent others from being diagnosed? Understanding everything about the situation is the key. The above guide sketches practically everything about this disease. There must be public awareness of what people should eat, how they should exercise, control their weight and change their lifestyle. Most people have a hectic life and have little or no time to exercise. To make matters worse, they consume junk food in large quantities, making them easy prey for type 2 diabetes. With proper training on observing a healthy lifestyle, type 2 diabetes can become a thing of the past. This can be the breakthrough of diabetes that saves your life.   \n",

I’m sorry your child has diabetes.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry my uninformed opinion — about a man in a restaurant who was checking his blood sugar and administering life-saving insulin before his meal — was hurtful. I was unaware. I was not being intentionally hateful.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m repenting for my mistake by using what happened as a teaching moment to help raise awareness about this cruel disease, [**as many on Twitter hoped I would**](https://twitter.com/Diabetes_DRI/status/1146780153420402694). Please know, I wasn’t intentionally trying to perpetuate misinformation. Please understand, my views reflected a lack of understanding about this incurable disease. That is why my comment struck a nerve and went viral. I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry I didn’t understand anything about Type 1 diabetes (T1D), which often occurs in children. Those with diabetes have a pancreas that does not make enough insulin. Blood testing, oral medications and injections become a way of life. Forever. I did know about Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, because some of my friends and family have it.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry I was woefully uninformed about what people living with diabetes go though, especially those with T1D, to stay alive. I’ve learned some must check blood sugar multiple times a day, and calculate correct doses of insulin based on calorie and carbs immediately before eating. I didn’t know that. I am thankful I don’t have diabetes or have to do that.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I have learned so much. More than 100 million Americans now live with diabetes, according to [**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/reports/reportcard.html). It’s good news that diabetes in adults has decreased, but sad and discouraging that it is on the rise for children. I can’t image how hard it must be for parents to manage this disease in young children. I’m blessed I don’t have to.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry parents have to teach their beautiful children with T1D to endure repeated needle pricks, to have no shame when it comes to testing blood sugar and to learn how to give themselves insulin shots before meals or snacks when in a restaurant, airplane, stadium or any public space. [**It is your right to manage your condition openly, anywhere, and in any place**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html). “People with diabetes have the right to participate fully in our society without sacrificing their medical safety or facing discrimination because of misunderstandings, fears, and stereotypes about diabetes,” according to the American Diabetes Association.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry that, before dashing an off-the-cuff opinion based on an emotional reaction on [**Let’s Eat South Florida**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/letseatsouthflorida/), I didn’t educate myself by visiting the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation at [**DiabetesResearch.org**](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__www.diabetesresearch.org_%26d%3DCwMFaQ%26c%3Dy2w-uYmhgFWijp_IQN0DhA%26r%3D8L2QR-YsbRfJPRpEthsVg_SZwcMRtUJg1T_XGDIFJIY%26m%3D92YS5pMszBmPh_bYKtAtTX5-ZrHyJaIeiOH1NhzS-Qs%26s%3D7ZdwHKg-L3i64-8rOdmZ5A_KTQVZhgmGYsxqjwAXyMg%26e%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdchristensen%40sunsentinel.com%7C6efb625dbaea41cdecd108d6ffe9a05f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636977776228408544&amp;sdata=KrKdiZVJiGmQogKPWCQ4v4RYzeijVzfATJBzWXrjVGQ%3D&amp;reserved=0), the American Association of Diabetes Educators at[ **Diabeteseducator.org**](http://diabeteseducator.org/), the Centers for Disease Control at [**CDC.gov/diabetes**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/education.html), the American Diabetes Foundation at [**Diabetes.org**](http://www.diabetes.org/) or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at [**JDRF.org**](https://www.jdrf.org/). Many of these organizations kindly offered to assist and educate me, and I thank them for that. As a journalist, I understand I have a responsibility to the truth, and I take that extremely seriously. But I also have opinions and views as a human, separate from my job. My comments were made in that capacity, a Jane Q. Citizen. But, alas, where does being a journalist begin and end when it comes to these sorts of things? It was not my wish to reflect badly upon my newspaper, colleagues, family or friends. Or, to become an internet pinata. For the record, the Sun Sentinel did not order me to apologize or write this column, nor did it threaten my job.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry some people think those with diabetes should test and administer insulin in a public restroom. I did not suggest that, as many incorrectly attributed to me. I do understand that a filthy bathroom can be a dangerous place to self-dose. There was equal outrage about my suggestion of going to the car. [**People with diabetes say they have a right to shameless public displays of diabetes**](https://insulinnation.com/treatment/shameless-public-displays-of-diabetes/), according to an enlightening post on InsulinNation.com.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry my opinion helped [**perpetuate stigma and shame**](https://www.diabetesdaily.com/blog/2013/07/the-stigma-of-diabetes/), leading some, *especially*children, to hide their condition. I’ve learned this can develop into poor management because people wait to treat until they are in a private space. That’s dangerous and puts their health at serious risk. Many members of the diabetes community have educated me about the hell they go though to live. I thank them for sharing their gut-wrenching stories with me. I wish they didn’t have this sadistic disease.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry this disease could result in the loss of limbs, eyesight, causes diabetic heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, high blood pressure, nerve damage and other medical complications. How utterly awful that must be to lose a foot, leg, or your life, or have to endure regular, painful [**dialysis as kidneys begin to fail**](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/diabetes).  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry life-sustaining insulin can cost thousands of dollars a month. [**It’s wrong that companies are trying to make a profit off millions of humans who need his medication to live**](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-op-edit-drug-pricing-nat-scandal-20190319-story.html#nt=instory-link). “As many as one in every five Americans are trying to cope with Big Pharma’s morally indefensible pricing schemes by leaving prescriptions unfilled, skipping doses or splitting pills,” according to an editorial the Sun Sentinel recently published.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry people often fat- and food-shame those living with diabetes for what they eat and for \"not maintaining a healthy diet.” It’s nobody’s business what anyone eats or how diabetes is managed.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry low or high blood sugar can kill or cause a coma from insulin shock because medicine wasn’t dosed correctly or taken on time, or because of shame.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry some members of the diabetes community felt it was OK to bully, harass and threaten me, my family and friends on social media. I received death threats, was subjected to abusive language, and have been relentlessly trolled by hundreds of members of the diabetes community for days. That’s not OK. Emails and Facebook messages were sent to the Sun Sentinel demanding I be fired for my opinion (that’s my job). Some kind souls were ashamed of this behavior and warned me I wasn’t safe. I thank them for that. Others sent emails to help educate me. Thanks for that.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Others, not so much. “I saw your post about someone taking literally life saving insulin in a restaurant and that you thought it was “gross,” wrote Kristen Hohmann in an email. “I can only hope someone or everyone you love or you directly discover an entirely unprovoked genetic illness that destroys your ability to live life as a normal person and have to do something like that to stay alive. I hope you die in a fire you ignorant bitch.”  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;More said they hoped I would die from a diabetic coma. Scads of others called me vile, unpublishable names on my personal [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217244351173136&amp;set=a.2749052177793&amp;type=3&amp;theater) and [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/doreenchristensen/?hl=en) accounts. No matter how offensive some thought my comments were, they had no right to threaten bodily harm. That’s not OK.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I contacted administrators of Facebook diabetes groups and asked them to moderate member comments that advocated harassing me online. They assured me they would, and they have. I thank them for that, and trust the diabetes community will police itself and speak out against such dangerous mob mentality.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry some think my opinion was discrimination. It was not. I didn’t not violate anyone’s rights by having an *opinion*. I took no action. My speech and this column is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Those out there who disagree with me and others — who also happen to have diabetes — have the right to express their opinions. I celebrate and welcome that. My comments did not violate the Americans With Disability Act. I did not violate any law. There is no need to report me to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as some on Twitter advocated. If people with diabetes are truly discriminated against, they can call [**ADA legal advocates at 800-342-2383**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html).

I dedicated my contributions to all those who have died from the disease. I know my money will help further diabetes education and research, but mostly, to one day find a cure.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I’m sorry diabetes sucks.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPersonally, I would love to scream at this woman.                                                     \n",
       "3687  Apologies in advance for the length, I just need to get this off my chest.\\n\\nThree years ago I weighed 310lbs and was starting to feel very ill. I was thirsty all the time, constantly peeing, and just overall not well. Before my symptoms started I knew I was unhealthy. I was a morbidly obese 27 year old woman. I'd tried dieting and exercise so many times and couldn't manage to lose weight. I was so hungry all. the. time. I couldn't get enough food, nothing satisfied me. I was very down on myself and depressed for all of my early 20s (not all of this was weight related, had some family trauma, a string of awful boyfriends, etc.). I ignored my symptoms for months telling myself it was all obesity related and I brought this on myself. \\n\\nWell, finally, the thing I'd always dreamed of happened. I started losing weight without changing my diet. I was joking with my coworkers about my new \"super power\" but inside I knew something was really wrong. When I lost 40lbs in one month, I finally made an appointment with my doctor (had to find a new doctor because at that point I'd last been seen by my pediatrician) got the blood work done, and received a Type 2 diagnosis. I was prescribed Metformin and Glimipiride. My a1c was 13.1.\\n\\nMy world was rocked. I beat myself up so much. I had done this to myself, I let myself get so fat I gave myself diabetes. It was really rough. But a little self care, and a lot of education later I learned that that's not true, and there are a lot of factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes. (Although, I have to admit while I outwardly preached this I did still blame my obesity and the way I treated my body for my diagnosis.)\\n\\nI did a lot of research and ignored my diabetes educator in lieu of internet experts (eye roll) and started a very strict keto diet. Within thee months I'd brought my a1c down to 5.3. I was my doctor's favorite patient. I felt better than I ever have in my life (though, if I'm being honest, still not 100%). For what felt like the first time My friends and family were so proud of me. I was the diabetes wonder child! My insurance stopped covering the 4X a day test strips I was receiving at this time, and I SO STUPIDLY stopped checking my blood sugar.\\n\\n It took about a year and I lost a total of 135lbs. I've weighed 175lbs for the past 2 years, and as a 5'8 female I've been mostly ok with that. Another 20lbs and I'll be at what's considered a healthy weight, but I still really prefer this body (loose skin, stretch marks and all!) over my previous 300+lbs body. \\n\\nThe reason I stopped losing weight is probably because I became a lot more lax on the keto diet. I never went back to drinking any sugary drinks, but more carbs slowly crept back into my life. I let myself have french fries occasionally, then maybe some Taco Bell, then a slice of cake on my birthday, a piece of pecan pie on Thanksgiving. For about 6 months I ate a keto diet probably 50% of the time. \\n\\nMeanwhile, my a1c was climbing higher and higher. My doctor was lecturing me (the reason I avoided the doctor for 10 years prior) and trying different medications. Then last October I was laid off from my job of 6 years. I completely gave up on myself and didn't care about myself, and fell into a depression, completely devoid of fucks to give. \\n\\nI scheduled a doctor's appointment before my insurance ran out and at that time my a1c was 9.2. Luckily, I was able to find a new, better, job fairly quickly but once you go off the rails it's hard to get back on track. I was eating so poorly, lots of fast food, sneaking lots of packaged sweets behind my fiance's back, but still pretending I was eating keto most of the time. (Why did I think it was ok to eat 12 oreos but still deny myself like fruit, yogurt, and whole wheat bread???)\\n\\nAnyway, to make an already way too long story short- about two weeks ago I started having symptoms of what I thought was acid reflux. Lots of heartburn, that burning gut feeling, etc. I was in SUCH denial. I knew what DKA was. I was constantly hungry and thirsty like when I was fat. I was practically guzzling Zantac and Tums. WHY DIDN'T I CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR??\\n\\nThen last Thursday, April 25th,  I started having trouble breathing. I left work, went home and took a nap. I asked my fiance to bring me frozen yogurt as I thought it would soothe my stomach. It did but he begged me to go to the doctor. I told him I was fine and I just needed to sleep. I sent him to go play on his PC and even joked to him \"You're going to be so sad if I die\" (just the kind of awful, dark humor that I have) He was like \"why the fuck would you say that??\"\\n\\nThe next morning I went to work. My fiance begged me to call out and go to the doctor. I was still struggling to breathe. I was at work for two hours before they forced me to go to a walk-in. I insisted on driving myself. \\n\\nAt the walk-in I KNOW I filled out all my paperwork correctly, stating that I was (to my knowledge at the time) Type 2 diabetic. I told them I was having acid reflux like symptoms. They insisted I was having a panic attack. I told them no, I know what a panic attack feels like, this wasn't it. I just wanted to breathe normally again. They kept insisting, brought multiple doctors in, and finally decided to run an EKG because of the family history of heart issues I have. \\n\\nThat's when I had an actual panic attack. Luckily, it came back clear. They sent me home with a prescription for a one-a-day acid reflux medication and some generic form of xanax. I went and got the prescription filled but started feeling a lot worse. I sent my fiance some really loopy texts. He begged me to call someone close by to come get me. I told him I was fine but was starting to get really loopy. I managed to make it home after stopping for more frozen yogurt. \\n\\nThe last thing I remember from that Friday is my fiance calling, and me telling him I made it home safe and not to worry. \\n\\nHe found me passed out on the living room floor. I wasn't wearing pants. My phone was by the sink, my purse upstairs, I don't know what was going through my mind. I had pooped myself. My body was shutting down. That night they told my mom and my fiance that they didn't know if I was going to make it.\\n\\nI woke up in the ICU, bruised to all hell. I spent 4 days receiving amazing care where every Endo who came to see me was certain that I was actually a Type 1 and in complete disbelief that I hadn't been diagnosed sooner. \\n\\nFriday I went to my diabetes education where my nurse practitioner confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis. It's been a real rollercoaster of emotions. \\n\\nMy outer body is still very sore and bruised but I can already tell I feel so much better being on insulin this past week. Emotionally, it's been hard too. I feel so bad for what I put my parents and fiance through. My poor dad flew all the way across the country not knowing if I was going to live or die. They all want to sue the walk-in clinic for not checking my blood sugar but I just blame myself.\\n\\nAnyway, I feel like I have a million questions but the ones that come to mind right now are:\\n\\n*How do you guys handle alcohol? Can I still drink? What about marijuana? They don't teach you about this in diabetes education class\\n\\n*Do you all actually stick to the recommended 60g of carbs per meal? Do you just learn how to take more insulin? I'm getting married next year and want to do the cake tasting! I also have a huge sweet tooth and have just been so frightened of anything sweet.\\n\\n*Pizza. What do?\\n\\n*I'm supposed to take my lantus at 9pm every night, what if I'm seeing a movie or something?\\n\\n*I'm seeing the endo next week. They said I would probably be set up with a CGM and a pump. If I have a choice, is this a good option? Which are the best? General tips and tricks are welcome. \\n\\nI think I'll leave it there and save the rest of my questions for my Endo but any general words of advice are sooo welcome. \\n\\nOne last thought- I watch Fellowship of the Ring yesterday since that's always been one of my comfort movies. When Frodo says \"I wish the ring never came to me. I wish none of this had happened\" and Gandalf gives the famous line \"So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" I. fucking. lost. it. I could not stop crying. Of course, that line is repeated later on in the movie so I lost it twice. I also lost it when Frodo is stabbed on Weathertop and almost dies because it just really hit close to home more than ever.\\n\\nAnyway, if you read that whole thing- bless you. Thank you so much for letting me get that off my chest.\\n\\ntl;dr CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "4181  Conquering your inner “It.”\\nBeating Diabetes Burnout\\n\\n   We’ve all experienced it. “Maybe if I ignore it, act like it doesn’t exist, it will go away.” Whether your “it” is a class you’re failing, your clingy girlfriend or your autoimmune disease that you are required to maintain every day, we all have our own “it.” But what happens when the burden that you chose to ignore, doesn’t care whether you want it to exist or not? Is the effort you exert really worth the life you will lead to live? Or are you so arrogant that you believe you are the one that, “Beats the Odds,” as they say?  Let me take you through the journey of my own “It.” A little thing my endocrinologist calls, “Diabetes Burnout.”\\n\\n   ‘BRR BRR’ Your cellphone is vibrating for the 27th time today because you didn’t show up for your 7 o’clock dinner date last night with your girl. It’s only been three months since you decided, “to take things serious,” as the kids call it these days. ‘We’re done, all guys are the same and you are no different,’ the new text notification says. Mission Accomplished, no more girl holding you down, nobody to tell you what to do. Simple right? Just ignore the text and go about your life, happy and care free. Now, what if there were no text messages? What if, you missed the date, but when you get home the next day after a long day at work, she’s still there acting like nothing ever happened. Better yet, she’s already setting up your next date, and you already know you’re going to skip that one too. Welcome to the life of a Type One diabetic. Whether it’s not checking your sugar or not giving yourself the insulin required for the cookie you just snuck by, no matter how much you ignore it, diabetes isn’t going tell you “we’re done.” She’s locked in and ready for the long haul. “Until Death Do Us Part,” but what I had failed to realize was Death was on my doorstep and this marriage between my diabetes and myself was on a crash course to an abrupt end. \\n\\n   First, let me take you down the “Highway to Hell,” that I was on with my diabetes. I was done. I was defeated and I no longer felt like the hand I was dealt, was the hand I was supposed to hold. To this day I remember the look on my mom’s face, and the tears in my dad’s eyes when the ER nurse looked at me and said, “Your life as you know it, is over.” Now, I don’t believe the nurse was attempting to be malicious or rude at that moment, but the life of a typical 17 year old who is attempting to fit in with all of his buddies, isn’t a life that a Type 1 diabetic should live. Well, for me anyway. “We’ll do this together,” I can still hear my dad saying to me. To my dad’s credit, he tried. We ate the same food, followed the same carb ratio and tried to work as a team to ‘defeat’ this nasty beast. However, what I didn’t know was after I’d go to sleep, dad would go and sneak a peanut butter sandwich. (Sneaky man he is.) In a 17 year olds brain, if your dad can’t do it, nobody can. That was my mindset. I tried to stay strong. I tried to keep up with the charity walks, and mentoring newly diagnosed diabetics, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking, “Damn, if dad can’t do this, superman can’t and if superman can’t, I damn sure can’t.” It became easier to bring that thought to the forefront of my brain, and my diabetes wellness on the backburner. It became easier to make up fictional number when my mom asked me what my blood sugar was then to take the work and go check it. Hell, it came easier to eat my lunch and go have a beer with the buddies, ignoring the fact that I need to take insulin. But why would I do all of these? For what, so I could live a couple years longer? Why did God deal all of this extra work to a kid who’s never really done any extra work? I could still go and socialize with my buddies. I could still go hang out in a parking lot until 3 a.m. and get up the next day and be totally fine, without dealing with my stupid diabetes. Why is my endocrinologist stressing to me to get things under control? He doesn’t understand! I’m living the life right now and I’ll be damned if I take time out of my day to tend to a disease that will affect me down the road. I’m living in the NOW! Boy, was that a mistake. \\n   \\n   After so many years of ignoring my responsibilities I was dealt, I developed an arrogance with myself. Maybe I’m the exception, maybe my health isn’t as bad as everyone keeps saying. I mean, they don’t know me. They don’t know how I feel. I feel great, at least that’s what I kept telling myself. So what, maybe I do sleep until 11:30 in the morning, waking up feeling groggy and ready to go back to sleep. Yeah, so what if my body feels dehydrated, I still woke up today. Diabetes couldn’t touch me. I’m Brandon freakin’ Leasure. I’m better than this, I’m better than some stupid disease. Looking back, I became the person that I was raised to avoid. I became arrogant. Yeah, I’d still hold the door for the next person, or refer to everyone as ma’am or sir, I wasn’t arrogant towards other people. I was arrogant towards myself and that’s the most dangerous arrogance you can obtain. For these purposes, we’ll call the arrogance towards other people, “Social Arrogance,” and arrogance towards yourself, “Self Arrogance.” Just as a social arrogant person would do to their peers, I stuck my nose up to the signs my body was telling me. It’s like, if you’re arrogant to your peers, one of these days, you’re going to catch a right hook right to the chin. It’s the exact same if you’re a “Self-Arrogant.” Except, I didn’t catch a right hook to the chin, I caught a one way ticket to the bathroom floor in the ER vomiting so violently, I couldn’t move. \\n\\n   Wow, how did this happen. How in the hell did I, Brandon freakin’ Leasure, wind up here. I mean, I was the poster boy. Everyone on the outside would tell me how proud of me they were, how I took diabetes and, “Kicked its ass.” I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be weak and vulnerable. At least, that’s what I told myself. To better understand the level of “self-arrogance” I had established, let me take you to the day my world came crashing down. It was a normal morning, I had gotten up, ate some cereal and was preparing to start my work for the day. (I worked from home.) But as I was setting up my day, I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t feel all too good and I knew a date to the toilet bowl was inevitable. Now, being an uncontrolled diabetic, puking was nothing to me. I figured I’d puke, feel better, and be a couple minutes late to logging in for work and all would be fine in the world. Except that’s not what happened. One puke turned into three, which turned into 4, which eventually ended up at 7 trips to the toilet bowl that morning. I couldn’t move. I worked up enough energy to climb back in bed and did what every boy does, I called my mom. Now after that phone call, I don’t remember much of anything, until I woke up on the floor of the ER Bathroom. Finally, I was taken into a room and immediately placed on fluids. To this point, I was good. Just another 3 day trip in the hospital and out I’d be ready to go back to my normal life. What I didn’t know, was this was the day my world would be flipped upside down. My parent’s had had enough of my way of living. They showed me tough love that day in the hospital and I earned my fair share of bedside lectures from my mom, dad and my fierce little grandmother. It was the talk I had with my grandmother, Mamaw as we call her, that really opened my eyes. She looked at me that day, and asked me the one question I wasn’t ready for. “Why?” Why was I in this hospital bed, what was so bad in my life that I ran away from all the responsibilities of my health to end up here. That one word, that one simple word, changed my life. \\n\\n   That day, I realized that Diabetes isn’t something you can just ignore and it will go away. If you ignore it too long, it will put you away. \\n\\n   The next few weeks entailed some crucial life changes that have helped me become the man I am today. I called off a wedding that was supposed to happen in 6 weeks. I decided to relinquish my rights to work from home, putting myself on a schedule. I removed all of the negative impacts that I had in my life the day I wound up on that bathroom floor. The beautiful thing is no matter how long it took me to acquire all of these negative influences, it took no time to remove them. Everything about my life is healthier now. I’m in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who doesn’t try to dictate my health, but encourages me to be the best diabetic I can be. With that beautiful woman came an eccentric two year old step daughter, who doesn’t see the diabetes, but sees a man who’s trying to be the best he can be, and she holds me accountable, whether she realizes it or not. I have an amazing relationship with my parents, better than I ever have before. But, the biggest thing that’s pulled me out of my Diabetic Burnout, is I’ve became what I like to call a, “First Responder Diabetic.” What I mean by that is, I no longer run away from my disease or the community that this disease has brought together, I want to run head first into it. \\n\\n   In closing, I’d just like to say this. You’re not alone. There is help out there, don’t be ashamed to use it. Don’t let your “Self-Arrogance” be the reason you end up on the bathroom floor in the local ER. You are valuable and you bring your own uniqueness to the table, don’t let a disease that is 100% manageable keep you from that. I think we all have a little, “Diabetic First Responder,” in us and we all can help each other with our everyday struggles. Diabetic Burnout is a pain in the ass, but I know you can dig yourself out of it, because I did. \\n\\n-\\tBrandon Leasure \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

a condition that makes your blood sugar level higher than normal Diabetes can be divided into Type 1 and Type Diabetes the latter being the most common What is type 2 diabetes Important gt gt Complete Guide About Diabetes https www howwebs com search label Diabetes lt lt This is a chronic condition that prevents your body from using the insulin it produces properly Insulin is responsible for regulating the movement of sugar in your cells In type 2 diabetes instead of the body converting sugar into energy it stores it in the bloodstream The difference between type 2 diabetes https www howwebs com 2018 11 Type 2 diabetes dysfunction and dementia Diabetes Health How Webs United States USA html and type 1 diabetes is that the latter is caused by insufficient insulin in the body due to the immune system in some people who destroy the cells that produce insulin Unlike type 2 diabetes a person s lifestyle does not contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes making it difficult to prevent it Why type 2 diabetes occurs This type of diabetes occurs because the body cells become insulin resistant ignoring sugar from the blood If there is too much sugar in your bloodstream for a longer period of time muscle and fat cells ignore the instructions of insulin to remove sugar from the blood and therefore more sugar accumulation in your bloodstream Under normal circumstances your pancreas produces enough insulin to drive sugar into your cells However during the development phase of type 2 diabetes your cells ignore sugar and therefore the sugar continues to move freely in your bloodstream This forces the pancreas to produce more insulin to try to maintain normal sugar levels but fails to keep up with the long term pace The excess sugar in your body is sometimes converted and stored as cholesterol which is why most victims of this type of diabetes are overweight Inactive lifestyles smoking and poor nutrition are the most important factors associated with the development of this diabetes The disease can also be hereditary Although the disease can affect a person of any age people from the early to mid 40s have a higher risk of getting this condition What

reversing type 2 diabetes If you have diabetes the book promises to free you from drug slavery through a procedural health guide called The 7 Steps to Healthy and the Big Diabetes Lie How it works The program informs users about everything that has to do with type 2 diabetes how it develops and how to combat it With this program they learn about the adjustments they can make to their lifestyle to protect them against not only type 2 diabetes but also against other diseases The program asks the reader the question do your current food choices keep you diabetic Some of the lessons that will be

teaches you how to maintain the correct PH level to make your body unfriendly to diseases such as cancer In general the guide emphasizes healthy eating and lifestyle routines as the key to controlling

Based on the authors argument the industry is running for profit by selling drugs that they know cannot fully treat Type 2 Diabetes but insist that one cannot survive without their use The major pharmaceutical companies are afraid that other successful approaches will affect their business results and bankrupt them According to the authors drugs treat symptoms instead of removing the cause of the disease and cause even more life threatening side effects compared to those of the disease itself This is evident in the medicines mentioned above because none of them lacks a side effect Why it is successful Unlike the drugs that only address the symptoms of type 2 diabetes this program addresses the cause of the problem to free the patient forever It teaches you how to reverse type 2

the main culprit Informing people about this disease is the first step to combat it How do we inform the victims and prevent others from being diagnosed Understanding everything about the situation is the key The above guide sketches practically everything about this disease There must be public awareness of what people should eat how they should exercise control their weight and change their lifestyle Most people have a hectic life and have little or no time to exercise To make matters worse they consume junk food in large quantities making them easy prey for type 2 diabetes With proper training on observing a healthy lifestyle type 2 diabetes can become a thing of the past This can be the breakthrough of diabetes that saves your life   \n",

       "3687  I was just diagnosed T1 after suffering DKA at age 30 and I m just freaking out a little bit Apologies in advance for the length I just need to get this off my chest Three years ago I weighed 310lbs and was starting to feel very ill I was thirsty all the time constantly peeing and just overall not well Before my symptoms started I knew I was unhealthy I was a morbidly obese 27 year old woman I d tried dieting and exercise so many times and couldn t manage to lose weight I was so hungry all the time I couldn t get enough food nothing satisfied me I was very down on myself and depressed for all of my early 20s not all of this was weight related had some family trauma a string of awful boyfriends etc I ignored my symptoms for months telling myself it was all obesity related and I brought this on myself Well finally the thing I d always dreamed of happened I started losing weight without changing my diet I was joking with my coworkers about my new super power but inside I knew something was really wrong When I lost 40lbs in one month I finally made an appointment with my doctor had to find a new doctor because at that point I d last been seen by my pediatrician got the blood work done and received a Type 2 diagnosis I was prescribed Metformin and Glimipiride My a1c was 13 1 My world was rocked I beat myself up so much I had done this to myself I let myself get so fat I gave myself diabetes It was really rough But a little self care and a lot of education later I learned that that s not true and there are a lot of factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes Although I have to admit while I outwardly preached this I did still blame my obesity and the way I treated my body for my diagnosis I did a lot of research and ignored my diabetes educator in lieu of internet experts eye roll and started a very strict keto diet Within thee months I d brought my a1c down to 5 3 I was my doctor s favorite patient I felt better than I ever have in my life though if I m being honest still not 100 For what felt like the first time My friends and family were so proud of me I was the diabetes wonder child My insurance stopped covering the 4X a day test strips I was receiving at this time and I SO STUPIDLY stopped checking my blood sugar It took about a year and I lost a total of 135lbs I ve weighed 175lbs for the past 2 years and as a 5 8 female I ve been mostly ok with that Another 20lbs and I ll be at what s considered a healthy weight but I still really prefer this body loose skin stretch marks and all over my previous 300 lbs body The reason I stopped losing weight is probably because I became a lot more lax on the keto diet I never went back to drinking any sugary drinks but more carbs slowly crept back into my life I let myself have french fries occasionally then maybe some Taco Bell then a slice of cake on my birthday a piece of pecan pie on Thanksgiving For about 6 months I ate a keto diet probably 50 of the time Meanwhile my a1c was climbing higher and higher My doctor was lecturing me the reason I avoided the doctor for 10 years prior and trying different medications Then last October I was laid off from my job of 6 years I completely gave up on myself and didn t care about myself and fell into a depression completely devoid of fucks to give I scheduled a doctor s appointment before my insurance ran out and at that time my a1c was 9 2 Luckily I was able to find a new better job fairly quickly but once you go off the rails it s hard to get back on track I was eating so poorly lots of fast food sneaking lots of packaged sweets behind my fiance s back but still pretending I was eating keto most of the time Why did I think it was ok to eat 12 oreos but still deny myself like fruit yogurt and whole wheat bread Anyway to make an already way too long story short about two weeks ago I started having symptoms of what I thought was acid reflux Lots of heartburn that burning gut feeling etc I was in SUCH denial I knew what DKA was I was constantly hungry and thirsty like when I was fat I was practically guzzling Zantac and Tums WHY DIDN T I CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR Then last Thursday April 25th I started having trouble breathing I left work went home and took a nap I asked my fiance to bring me frozen yogurt as I thought it would soothe my stomach It did but he begged me to go to the doctor I told him I was fine and I just needed to sleep I sent him to go play on his PC and even joked to him You re going to be so sad if I die just the kind of awful dark humor that I have He was like why the fuck would you say that The next morning I went to work My fiance begged me to call out and go to the doctor I was still struggling to breathe I was at work for two hours before they forced me to go to a walk in I insisted on driving myself At the walk in I KNOW I filled out all my paperwork correctly stating that I was to my knowledge at the time Type 2 diabetic I told them I was having acid reflux like symptoms They insisted I was having a panic attack I told them no I know what a panic attack feels like this wasn t it I just wanted to breathe normally again They kept insisting brought multiple doctors in and finally decided to run an EKG because of the family history of heart issues I have That s when I had an actual panic attack Luckily it came back clear They sent me home with a prescription for a one a day acid reflux medication and some generic form of xanax I went and got the prescription filled but started feeling a lot worse I sent my fiance some really loopy texts He begged me to call someone close by to come get me I told him I was fine but was starting to get really loopy I managed to make it home after stopping for more frozen yogurt The last thing I remember from that Friday is my fiance calling and me telling him I made it home safe and not to worry He found me passed out on the living room floor I wasn t wearing pants My phone was by the sink my purse upstairs I don t know what was going through my mind I had pooped myself My body was shutting down That night they told my mom and my fiance that they didn t know if I was going to make it I woke up in the ICU bruised to all hell I spent 4 days receiving amazing care where every Endo who came to see me was certain that I was actually a Type 1 and in complete disbelief that I hadn t been diagnosed sooner Friday I went to my diabetes education where my nurse practitioner confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis It s been a real rollercoaster of emotions My outer body is still very sore and bruised but I can already tell I feel so much better being on insulin this past week Emotionally it s been hard too I feel so bad for what I put my parents and fiance through My poor dad flew all the way across the country not knowing if I was going to live or die They all want to sue the walk in clinic for not checking my blood sugar but I just blame myself Anyway I feel like I have a million questions but the ones that come to mind right now are How do you guys handle alcohol Can I still drink What about marijuana They don t teach you about this in diabetes education class Do you all actually stick to the recommended 60g of carbs per meal Do you just learn how to take more insulin I m getting married next year and want to do the cake tasting I also have a huge sweet tooth and have just been so frightened of anything sweet Pizza What do I m supposed to take my lantus at 9pm every night what if I m seeing a movie or something I m seeing the endo next week They said I would probably be set up with a CGM and a pump If I have a choice is this a good option Which are the best General tips and tricks are welcome I think I ll leave it there and save the rest of my questions for my Endo but any general words of advice are sooo welcome One last thought I watch Fellowship of the Ring yesterday since that s always been one of my comfort movies When Frodo says I wish the ring never came to me I wish none of this had happened and Gandalf gives the famous line So do all who live to see such times But that is not for them to decide All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us I fucking lost it I could not stop crying Of course that line is repeated later on in the movie so I lost it twice I also lost it when Frodo is stabbed on Weathertop and almost dies because it just really hit close to home more than ever Anyway if you read that whole thing bless you Thank you so much for letting me get that off my chest tl dr CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR

       "4181  I don t really know what this is Just me a word document and my story Conquering your inner It Beating Diabetes Burnout We ve all experienced it Maybe if I ignore it act like it doesn t exist it will go away Whether your it is a class you re failing your clingy girlfriend or your autoimmune disease that you are required to maintain every day we all have our own it But what happens when the burden that you chose to ignore doesn t care whether you want it to exist or not Is the effort you exert really worth the life you will lead to live Or are you so arrogant that you believe you are the one that Beats the Odds as they say Let me take you through the journey of my own It A little thing my endocrinologist calls Diabetes Burnout BRR BRR Your cellphone is vibrating for the 27th time today because you didn t show up for your 7 o clock dinner date last night with your girl It s only been three months since you decided to take things serious as the kids call it these days We re done all guys are the same and you are no different the new text notification says Mission Accomplished no more girl holding you down nobody to tell you what to do Simple right Just ignore the text and go about your life happy and care free Now what if there were no text messages What if you missed the date but when you get home the next day after a long day at work she s still there acting like nothing ever happened Better yet she s already setting up your next date and you already know you re going to skip that one too Welcome to the life of a Type One diabetic Whether it s not checking your sugar or not giving yourself the insulin required for the cookie you just snuck by no matter how much you ignore it diabetes isn t going tell you we re done She s locked in and ready for the long haul Until Death Do Us Part but what I had failed to realize was Death was on my doorstep and this marriage between my diabetes and myself was on a crash course to an abrupt end First let me take you down the Highway to Hell that I was on with my diabetes I was done I was defeated and I no longer felt like the hand I was dealt was the hand I was supposed to hold To this day I remember the look on my mom s face and the tears in my dad s eyes when the ER nurse looked at me and said Your life as you know it is over Now I don t believe the nurse was attempting to be malicious or rude at that moment but the life of a typical 17 year old who is attempting to fit in with all of his buddies isn t a life that a Type 1 diabetic should live Well for me anyway We ll do this together I can still hear my dad saying to me To my dad s credit he tried We ate the same food followed the same carb ratio and tried to work as a team to defeat this nasty beast However what I didn t know was after I d go to sleep dad would go and sneak a peanut butter sandwich Sneaky man he is In a 17 year olds brain if your dad can t do it nobody can That was my mindset I tried to stay strong I tried to keep up with the charity walks and mentoring newly diagnosed diabetics but in the back of my mind I kept thinking Damn if dad can t do this superman can t and if superman can t I damn sure can t It became easier to bring that thought to the forefront of my brain and my diabetes wellness on the backburner It became easier to make up fictional number when my mom asked me what my blood sugar was then to take the work and go check it Hell it came easier to eat my lunch and go have a beer with the buddies ignoring the fact that I need to take insulin But why would I do all of these For what so I could live a couple years longer Why did God deal all of this extra work to a kid who s never really done any extra work I could still go and socialize with my buddies I could still go hang out in a parking lot until 3 a m and get up the next day and be totally fine without dealing with my stupid diabetes Why is my endocrinologist stressing to me to get things under control He doesn t understand I m living the life right now and I ll be damned if I take time out of my day to tend to a disease that will affect me down the road I m living in the NOW Boy was that a mistake After so many years of ignoring my responsibilities I was dealt I developed an arrogance with myself Maybe I m the exception maybe my health isn t as bad as everyone keeps saying I mean they don t know me They don t know how I feel I feel great at least that s what I kept telling myself So what maybe I do sleep until 11 30 in the morning waking up feeling groggy and ready to go back to sleep Yeah so what if my body feels dehydrated I still woke up today Diabetes couldn t touch me I m Brandon freakin Leasure I m better than this I m better than some stupid disease Looking back I became the person that I was raised to avoid I became arrogant Yeah I d still hold the door for the next person or refer to everyone as ma am or sir I wasn t arrogant towards other people I was arrogant towards myself and that s the most dangerous arrogance you can obtain For these purposes we ll call the arrogance towards other people Social Arrogance and arrogance towards yourself Self Arrogance Just as a social arrogant person would do to their peers I stuck my nose up to the signs my body was telling me It s like if you re arrogant to your peers one of these days you re going to catch a right hook right to the chin It s the exact same if you re a Self Arrogant Except I didn t catch a right hook to the chin I caught a one way ticket to the bathroom floor in the ER vomiting so violently I couldn t move Wow how did this happen How in the hell did I Brandon freakin Leasure wind up here I mean I was the poster boy Everyone on the outside would tell me how proud of me they were how I took diabetes and Kicked its ass I m not supposed to be here I m not supposed to be weak and vulnerable At least that s what I told myself To better understand the level of self arrogance I had established let me take you to the day my world came crashing down It was a normal morning I had gotten up ate some cereal and was preparing to start my work for the day I worked from home But as I was setting up my day I knew something wasn t right I didn t feel all too good and I knew a date to the toilet bowl was inevitable Now being an uncontrolled diabetic puking was nothing to me I figured I d puke feel better and be a couple minutes late to logging in for work and all would be fine in the world Except that s not what happened One puke turned into three which turned into 4 which eventually ended up at 7 trips to the toilet bowl that morning I couldn t move I worked up enough energy to climb back in bed and did what every boy does I called my mom Now after that phone call I don t remember much of anything until I woke up on the floor of the ER Bathroom Finally I was taken into a room and immediately placed on fluids To this point I was good Just another 3 day trip in the hospital and out I d be ready to go back to my normal life What I didn t know was this was the day my world would be flipped upside down My parent s had had enough of my way of living They showed me tough love that day in the hospital and I earned my fair share of bedside lectures from my mom dad and my fierce little grandmother It was the talk I had with my grandmother Mamaw as we call her that really opened my eyes She looked at me that day and asked me the one question I wasn t ready for Why Why was I in this hospital bed what was so bad in my life that I ran away from all the responsibilities of my health to end up here That one word that one simple word changed my life That day I realized that Diabetes isn t something you can just ignore and it will go away If you ignore it too long it will put you away The next few weeks entailed some crucial life changes that have helped me become the man I am today I called off a wedding that was supposed to happen in 6 weeks I decided to relinquish my rights to work from home putting myself on a schedule I removed all of the negative impacts that I had in my life the day I wound up on that bathroom floor The beautiful thing is no matter how long it took me to acquire all of these negative influences it took no time to remove them Everything about my life is healthier now I m in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who doesn t try to dictate my health but encourages me to be the best diabetic I can be With that beautiful woman came an eccentric two year old step daughter who doesn t see the diabetes but sees a man who s trying to be the best he can be and she holds me accountable whether she realizes it or not I have an amazing relationship with my parents better than I ever have before But the biggest thing that s pulled me out of my Diabetic Burnout is I ve became what I like to call a First Responder Diabetic What I mean by that is I no longer run away from my disease or the community that this disease has brought together I want to run head first into it In closing I d just like to say this You re not alone There is help out there don t be ashamed to use it Don t let your Self Arrogance be the reason you end up on the bathroom floor in the local ER You are valuable and you bring your own uniqueness to the table don t let a disease that is 100 manageable keep you from that I think we all have a little Diabetic First Responder in us and we all can help each other with our everyday struggles Diabetic Burnout is a pain in the ass but I know you can dig yourself out of it because I did Brandon Leasure

       "      <td>Since December (maybe even November/October) I've been struggling to properly regulate my blood sugar. Despite 7 years of experience, I've ran out of ideas for what is causing these irregular spikes. I would go see my doctor, but my appointment is still a another month away without any possibility of getting one sooner.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/625phcy37oh41.png?width=1387&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1fd46e754394737658712e47c25c90bcb742b65\\n\\nThe graph does a good job of representing how my blood sugar has been acting for a while now.\\n\\nThis is what a typical day looks like;\\n\\n1. I wake up within range of where I want to be(, sometimes without the initial spike shown at the end of the graph), which to me would indicate that my basal insulin (Toujeo) is fine.\\n2. I eat breakfast, usually 4 slices of bread with salami and cheese, which sends my sugar flying (the very first spike on the left is caused by this).\\n3. I take an additional dose of bolus insulin (Fiasp) to get the sugar back down.\\n4. After several (5-6+) hours, once my blood sugar is relatively close to range, I go for a 2nd meal (dinner) which either, despite any kind of fine tuning, sends my sugar flying up (13+) again or crashing down (3.5-). (What occurred on that graph is pretty unusual for me. where the dose seemed to actually be fine, but then later spiked up after me falling asleep.) Even when I attempt to regulate for a similar meal the following day with minor adjustments, the result is either the same or hard in the complete opposite direction.\\n5. The rest of the day is then usually spent trying to fix the chaos that the meals have caused, without being able to go for a 3rd meal that day before bed. This usually takes 1-3 additional doses of bolus (Fiasp) insulin to do.\\n\\nOther information:\\n\\n* During January I attempted to get more active at the gym. Before then I was taking 30 basal (Toujeo) units before bed, which was a new record high (throughout the 7 years) for me set in that month. After a few sessions at the gym, I was back down to my pre-December usual, 18 units. But this only increased the rate of the spikes, causing even more confusion and without still being able to eat more than twice a day just made me feel nauseous. So these days are mostly spent indoors with minimal activity.\\n* I've recently lowered my basal insulin to 19 (gradually down from 30 in January), as I'd wake up below range at night without any additional bolus insulin for hours prior to falling asleep. This does seem to change a lot though.\\n* Last summer I was able to regulate my blood sugar just fine. I was regularly jogging and otherwise relatively active. So I think I know how to dose under normal conditions.\\n\\nI've spent the better part of my functioning hours, those where I'm not experiencing strong symptoms, to find any sort of reasoning behind these irregular spikes and lack of control. I'm on my last semester at uni, which is certainly can be stressful, but wouldn't expect it to be the cause of this long period of consistent irregularities. Though I suppose it could have a spiraling effect, that again is just a another guess at something that might not even be related.\\n\\nWould love some input and suggestions. Thanks for reading. :)</td>\n",

I spend 7 months in Hospital after my son was born and lost my pancreas in the process. \\n\\nIn the middle of last year, I fell pregnant. It wasn’t planned. Two days after the blood test got confirmed (I had only taken a at home test before that and the lines were very faint) I had a miscarriage. \\n\\nAlthough my partner and I were devastated it was easier to accept as we weren’t planning and we’ve have already had our fair share of devastating news in the last year or so. \\n\\nAfter all that trauma had passed, we seriously talked about expanding our family. We originally wanted at least 4 kids but I honestly struggle with my sugar so we knew that wasn’t going to happen. \\n\\nAfter talking we decided to have one more kid, regardless of gender, and we’d stop. I want to get my tubes tied after our last kid as to not experience anymore unwanted pregnancy as the doctor said they’d all most likely end in miscarriages. \\n\\nI started to work with my doctor, a diabetes nurse and a dietician to work towards a healthy pregnancy. My sugar has improved so much but it’s nowhere near perfect and we’ve had to push make the ‘conceiving’ date twice now..\\n\\nSo, one with the actually post...\\n\\nMy last period was in November. I’ve missed 3 periods now. \\n\\nI’ve taken 3 at home test, all spanned out over the months and all of them negative. \\n\\nI wasn’t worried at first because my period had been unreliable in the past, I thought that perhaps that cycle was starting again. \\n\\nAfter the third month hit, I got worried and went to my doctor for a blood test. \\n\\nI got the results back today. She said they were inconclusive. \\n\\nI’m not a medical expert so sorry for this bad explanation... \\n\\nShe said if the human grow hormone (I think that’s what it’s called?) is below 5 you’re not pregnant and if it’s above 25 you are pregnant. Mine was 10. \\n\\nShe said, it could be too early to tell and to come back for another blood test in two weeks. \\n\\nI was very angry (?) and confused. I was sure that I definitely wasn’t in the early stages of pregnancy because my period has been late for around 6 weeks so IF I was pregnant I should be further along then that. \\n\\nMy instant conclusion was that I must have fell pregnant late last year and had miscarriage and I didn’t bleed so I might get I’ll etc etc. it was a moment of panic since my first miscarriage was traumatic and I really wasn’t thinking straight. \\n\\nLater that day, tonight, I thought about what my doctor said and the logic of it all. If I did have a miscarriage last year there wouldn’t be any traces of the hormone left would there? \\n\\nI was confused and upset. \\n\\nI couldn’t wait two more weeks to find out, Especially since I’ve had two semi low sugars for my readings. My sugar is supposed to be between 4-10. My sugars were all 4.3 and 4 which make me start to shake and feel sick. \\n\\n\\n I took a at home kit again, basically to prove to myself that it was nothing and shake the anxiety... \\n\\nIt came up positive right away, not even the weird very faint line that happened during the miscarriage, it looked normally.\\n\\n(This is important to me because my doctor said that the faint line would have been because there wasn’t enough of the hormone in my system to detect. That my sugar levels would have caused an early development defect in the embryo and it wouldn’t have formed correctly, so it stopping growing and produced the hormone.) \\n\\n\\nSo I figured that if the results from the test I did a few days ago said my levels a low but they were higher enough to appear on a at home test then perhaps I am pregnant and there may be a chance of a successful pregnancy. \\n\\nI’ve been told by almost all the medical experts in my life that the best way to achieve a healthy pregnancy and baby is to have perfect sugar not only during the pregnancy but while you conceive and the first few weeks. \\n\\nIt basically lays down a perfect foundation for the embryo to form upon. I’m sure my sugar levels haven’t been the best...  No major lows but a few highs. My highest level is supposed to be 10, I’ve had 15-17. \\n\\nHas anyone had a similar problem? Not the best levels during the start but had a healthy baby? Thanks.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi,\\n\\nI am a 17yr old T1D (diagnosed Sep. 2018) in Canada and for the past few days I've been considering upgrading from my **current setup** of: The Freestyle Libre + MDI using Humalog/Lantus (Regular Pens)\\n\\nI have **looked into pumps** including the tubeless omnipod and after having been initially intrigued by the Tandem/Dexcom combo (due to the level of automation, control, and accuracy it seems to provide), I decided pumps weren't worth it for me at this time due to:\\n\\n* The discomfort of having a pump on 24/7 esp. w/ exercise, bumping into things, showering, sleeping, sweating, etc. (e.g. I was totally horrified w/ insulin pens at the start - I would sit 30 mins. and not be able to inject myself)\\n* The potential for developing scar tissue and finding new spots to keep putting pumps at (esp. as the years go by)\\n* My A1C has been throughout the 6's (as low as 6.3 and as high as 6.9) which doesn't seem to call for pump usage (according to me diabetes nurse) - my TDD has generally been less than 30 units - sometimes as low as 15 if I am extremely low carb.\\n\\n**What I am now considering is:** using a Freestyle Libre w/ a Smart Insulin Pen. Does anyone know if this (see link) has materialized and what the extent of the technology is? \\n\\n[https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/novo-nordisks-new-insulin-pens-will-integrate-abbotts-freestyle-libre-system](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/novo-nordisks-new-insulin-pens-will-integrate-abbotts-freestyle-libre-system) \\n\\nMy **ideal vision** for diabetes management would be the following if it could happen: one app where one can track their food (so carbs AND protein are automatically determined based on grams of x, y, or z in your meal), then based on the BG readings from the Libre you are given the amount of insulin you should take (it would sense changes in your insulin sensitivity and adapt your carb/protein to insulin ratio accordingly as time passes), it then tracks your insulin on board (and keeps it in mind at future meals/exercise), if you exercise you can input that (it adapts accordingly), if it senses a daily dawn phenomenon, or blood sugar going low, the AI could automatically tell you to increase/decrease basal or to bolus insulin or to eat x grams of carbs (almost like an artifical pancreas). To clarify: The AI would keep in mind the amount of insulin your using from the smart pen and would learn to adjust over time.\\n\\nAdditional Ideas: It could suggest foods that don't work well with you, or keep in mind your dieting preferences. It could have a satiety option and suggest meals you've had in the past that make you full yet don't raise your BG. It could optimize for micronutrients in food as well and tell you what you're lacking in.\\n\\nWhat's the closest to that there now is? What are the options in Canada?\\n\\nBTW: the reason I'm going for the Libre and not Dexcom is it seems to last a bit longer (14 vs. 10 days) and it doesn't seem as intrusive (a bit smaller) and it seems a bit more convenient.\\n\\nThanks a lot!</td>\n",

If possible, measure the temperature (e.g. with an instant read thermometer).\\n   * Measure your blood glucose with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.\\n      * If you don't have both types of meters, use whichever you do have (data will still be useful for the second goal)\\n   * Take a 20 minute shower.\\n   * As soon as you finish the shower, measure your blood glucose again with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.\\n   * Monitor your blood sugar for one hour (measure every 15 min. for finger-stick meter)\\n   * Record anything that might have affected blood glucose during the experiment.\\n   * Repeat the experiment multiple times (preferably ≥3, but any data is better than nothing) to assess within-person variability.\\n   * Post your data in a comment or PM to [u/sskaye](https://www.reddit.com/u/sskaye/).

       "      <td>Howdy fellow T1s!\\n\\nFirst off, I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now.  I have been waiting for this for so long it's not even funny.\\n\\nBut let's talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I've been on Control IQ.\\n\\nSensor errors.\\n\\nSo I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session.  Was it slightly confusing after the hour+ long training that I didn't actually have to pair my pump to a device?  Yes.\\n\\nWorkaround: I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump.  Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected.  Probably won't have to deal with the likes of this again.  But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired.  We'll see..\\n\\nSo that sensor error...\\n\\nI awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing.  This was not, repeat, not, a compression low.  I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour (after waking up).  I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 (twice). \\n\\nWhat I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do.\\n\\nI calibrated.\\n\\nIt buzzed and told me to test again. I did so and recalibrated.\\n\\nWithin a couple minutes, the rise to 160 began on the pump.  But it didn't do it all at once.  It did it gradually over 20 minutes.   Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar.  It kicked in 2.5 units...  Um...\\n\\nSo I suspended basal and waited an hour.  I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings.  Still had a ton on board though.  It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while.  \\n\\nThis was not a relaxing experience.\\n\\nFast forward to today.  I changed the sensor last night (it was getting flakey in the evening).  This morning there was an actual compression low.  Even though I was in suspend mode, I was actually 170.  I waited for it to raise back up, after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio.  Figured that would knock me down to the 120-130 range.  But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not work out and I ended up going low.\\n\\nSO...  IN THE FUTURE...  \\n\\nAny time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low, I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour.  By then, whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won't have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change.\\n\\nIt should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience.  This may be a rare occurrence.  But if it happens to you, maybe what I'm trying will work for you.\\n\\nI'll report here if it happens again.  Also, I'll report it to customer service as well.\\n\\nHas anyone else had anything weird happen?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Control IQ Pitfalls and Possible WorkaroundsHowdy fellow T1s First off I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now I have been waiting for this for so long it s not even funny But let s talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I ve been on Control IQ Sensor errors So I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session Was it slightly confusing after the hour long training that I didn t actually have to pair my pump to a device Yes Workaround I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected Probably won t have to deal with the likes of this again But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired We ll see So that sensor error I awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing This was not repeat not a compression low I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour after waking up I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 twice What I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do I calibrated It buzzed and told me to test again I did so and recalibrated Within a couple minutes the rise to 160 began on the pump But it didn t do it all at once It did it gradually over 20 minutes Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar It kicked in 2 5 units Um So I suspended basal and waited an hour I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings Still had a ton on board though It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while This was not a relaxing experience Fast forward to today I changed the sensor last night it was getting flakey in the evening This morning there was an actual compression low Even though I was in suspend mode I was actually 170 I waited for it to raise back up after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio Figured that would knock me down to the 120 130 range But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units Needless to say I did not work out and I ended up going low SO IN THE FUTURE Any time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour By then whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won t have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change It should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience This may be a rare occurrence But if it happens to you maybe what I m trying will work for you I ll report here if it happens again Also I ll report it to customer service as well Has anyone else had anything weird happen</td>\n",

       "      <td>At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway - not for everyone, but for hand-picked DM I patients like me. I had the Libre 1 before (I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself), and it was good.\\n\\nHowever, the Libre 2 is a relevation. I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms - when they work.\\n\\nThe problem: When you put on the sensor, you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App. After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor, which is exactly 2 weeks. (You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app, but the alarms will go to the reader. I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms. If you activate with the App, the reader won't work.) \\n\\nI do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times, so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3. Also, I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch, a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE. This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife.\\n\\nWhen it works - which it did at times -, the system is absolutely brilliant. It kind of gave me a new lease of life. I exercise very much, and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia.\\n\\nBUT: **The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best.** After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious \"No alarms\" warning in the app.\\n\\nDespite this, **the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings \"No connection with the sensor\" regularly, also at night.** All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep!\\n\\nLast night I was woken by several of these false alarms. This morning I got stupid \"no connection alarms\" all through the morning. The program asks you to check you sensor, but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11:30 a.m. that at my glucose was 14 mmol/l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin. So **when the system state is \"No connection\", the system will not warn about hyper- and hypoglucemia.**\\n\\nAbbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless. The whole system is a black box. Part of it works through Near field communication (NFC), part through Bluetooth (you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone), but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone's Bluetooth configuration pages.\\n\\nI have 2 **questions** to the community:\\n\\n**(1) Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue?**\\n\\n**(2) Which smartphone do you use?** I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand. - Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue? Can anyone with Sony Xperia Z5 confirm that the LibreLink App gives out correct alarms? Is there another android phone that works reliably against a Libre 2?</td>\n",

       "      <td>LibreLink App for Libre 2 Alarms not working with Sony Xperia XZ3At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway not for everyone but for hand picked DM I patients like me I had the Libre 1 before I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself and it was good However the Libre 2 is a relevation I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms when they work The problem When you put on the sensor you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor which is exactly 2 weeks You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app but the alarms will go to the reader I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms If you activate with the App the reader won t work I do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3 Also I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife When it works which it did at times the system is absolutely brilliant It kind of gave me a new lease of life I exercise very much and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia BUT The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious No alarms warning in the app Despite this the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings No connection with the sensor regularly also at night All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep Last night I was woken by several of these false alarms This morning I got stupid no connection alarms all through the morning The program asks you to check you sensor but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11 30 a m that at my glucose was 14 mmol l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin So when the system state is No connection the system will not warn about hyper and hypoglucemia Abbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless The whole system is a black box Part of it works through Near field communication NFC part through Bluetooth you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone s Bluetooth configuration pages I have 2 questions to the community 1 Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue 2 Which smartphone do you use I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue Can anyone with Sony Xperia Z5 confirm that the LibreLink App gives out correct alarms Is there another android phone that works reliably against a Libre 2</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello to everyone who reads this, I’ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors. I’m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on. I’ve been excessively thirsty, urinating way more than usual, including during the night which I’ve NEVER done before, extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class, and above all I’ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat. All I was told was my glucose was high, and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment, and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension. She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn’t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today. Well, yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day, and then I ate lunch with a friend. Shortly after getting lunch (we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating) I had a migraine and stomach pain again, and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could. At about 7:30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn’t feel nearly that bad. I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9:00 when I couldn’t stand it anymore, mind you, I’ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER, so it’s obviously bad. I tell the nurse everything that’s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done, I just kinda got sent away. The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton. The CT scan comes back normal, which isn’t surprising, and I’m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches, and then the nurse came in and discharged me. At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them, not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER. I feel incredibly stupid. I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on, and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork. I’m just at a loss for words, and I don’t know what to do.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scared and ConfusedHello to everyone who reads this I ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors I m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on I ve been excessively thirsty urinating way more than usual including during the night which I ve NEVER done before extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class and above all I ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat All I was told was my glucose was high and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today Well yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day and then I ate lunch with a friend Shortly after getting lunch we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating I had a migraine and stomach pain again and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could At about 7 30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn t feel nearly that bad I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9 00 when I couldn t stand it anymore mind you I ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER so it s obviously bad I tell the nurse everything that s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done I just kinda got sent away The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton The CT scan comes back normal which isn t surprising and I m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches and then the nurse came in and discharged me At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER I feel incredibly stupid I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork I m just at a loss for words and I don t know what to do</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi, Sorry for such a long post, I just got Diagnosed as a Ti diabetic 14 days ago. 29-year-old male 250 Lbs. A little back story Never knew I had TI until a few weeks ago I started getting extremely dry mouth, urinating tons. Then I woke up throwing up, I threw up over 30 times and had zero energy, legit felt like I was dying, I thought I had food poisoning, boy was I wrong! If my mother didn't help me I would be dead right now. Thinking back on it we should have just called 911 for an ambulance. I used the last percent of energy to get into the car and she drove me to the ER. They rushed me in and my blood sugar level was over 1000. They could not get blood out of me, it was coagulating. But they finally did. I spent 6 days in ICU, the intensive care unit. My potassium levels were super low, got IV's over and over. Finally made it out and they discharged me. I feel so much better and I am so grateful to be alive and survive. The doctors said they have never seen such a high level over 1000 BS. I am on a low carb Keto diet now. I take 35 units of Levemir in the morning and take Novolog with each meal 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My blood sugar level has been in the 100's like 188 to 130 for this past week but every time around 3pm to 5pm my Blood sugar starts to drop to like 90, then 80, then 70, when this happens I drink some orange juice or glucose liquid or gel, then it spikes back up to 130 and stays like that till the morning. I have no idea why my BS keeps dropping like this every day. It's a pattern. I have been calling my doctor about and she now has me Minus 5 units for lunch and now dinner. I know that I just got diagnosed and its a feel out process my doctor doesn't know the right insulin intake yet because it's only been 2 weeks. But this scares me so much and I am afraid to go to sleep every night and is overall very stressful for me. I am doing great with my new diet. I just dip in the middle of the day. I take an AC1 test in a few weeks. I am just so new to this and wonder if anybody can help me or know why this is happening to me. \\nThis is what I have been eating every day- its the same thing everyday lol  \\n--Breakfast at 8am--\\n- 1 Cup of Cheerios cereal\\n- 1 cup of milk\\n- 1 light yogurt   - Meal equals    = 50 Carbs\\n--Snack at 10am--\\n1- boost drink\\n2- Babybel Cheeses\\n1 turkey meat stick, it's a little one  Meal equals = 28 Carbs \\n\\n--Lunch at 12 pm--\\n- McDonald's Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken \\n- 3 tablespoons of salad dressing ^  \\n- 1 cucumber with 3 cherry tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of Salad dressing.          Meal equals = 57 Carbs\\n\\n--Snack at 2 pm--\\n- 1 Apple \\n- 3 tablespoons of Cashew or Almond butter\\n- 3 Babybel Cheeses\\n- 1 or 2 turkey meat sticks    Meal equals = 40 carbs\\n\\n--Dinner at 4pm--\\n- Chicken Breast cooked in butter \\n- Salad with cucumbers 3 tablespoons of dressing, added spinach and greens\\n- 2 cups of broccoli\\n- 1 greek yogurt with 4 blueberries added to it   Meal equals =35 Carbs\\nI just wanted to put what I have been eating everyday, I am new to this and I feel like I have adjusted well since this turned my whole world upside down and I feel very scared, basically not knowing next to any information when I left the hospital. If anybody out there reads this thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can help me with any information, tips or insight about why the level keeps dropping this reply to this. I am fighting and I will never give up, I am beating this, I just want to be stable blood sugar level and be able to do stuff. Sorry for the insanely long post. I do not know what to do and I am scared. I love you all and God bless, I am on the edge hoping I get a response because this is so new to me. Thanks again.</td>\n",

I know, I should have paid better attention.\\n\\nI contacted my new insurance company to figure out who I needed to go through to get them to pay for part of my new G5.\\n\\nI have sensors due to multiple failures from earlier times that Dexcom kindly replaced. I was just trying to get a new G5 transmitter.\\n\\n\"Hello, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\" Crazy Lady at medical supply company my insurance pays for.\\n\\nI told her my name.\\n\\n\"Hello! And what can I help you with today?\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I'd like to see if you guys carry the G5 transmitter.\" -me\\n\\n\"We certainly do carry the G4 transmitter! Shall I start a new account for you?\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I said the G5 transmitter. I'm not interested in the G4.\" -me\\n\\n\"They don't make a G5 transmitter. They make G5 sensors and a G4 transmitter that goes with the G5 sensors.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"Umm... What? I've been on the G5 for 2 years now.\" -me\\n\\n\"You must be mistaken. The sensors that come with the G4 transmitter are labeled as G5, but they do not make a G5 transmitter.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"No, the sensors are labeled as working with both the G4 and the G5 transmitters. I've been on the G5 for 2 years now, I think I know they exists.\" -me\\n\\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, but you are mistaken.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"Ok, so what do you say if I ask about the G6?\" -me, not wanting the G6, I want the G5 that I have sensors for.\\n\\n\"Yes, we also carry the G6 which I can help you ordering right now if you'd like.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I really wouldn't like the G6, I would like the G5.\" -me\\n\\n\"I can get you G5 sensors, but we only carry the G4 and the G6 because Dexcom doesn't make a G5 transmitter.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I've had the G5 transmitter for two years now, and suddenly they don't make it?\" -me\\n\\n\"Ma'am, you can contact Dexcom if you'd like to, and they will tell you that the only transmitters they make are the G4 and the G6. The G5 is the sensors to the G4. There is no such thing as a-\" -Crazy Lady, as I hung up on her.\\n\\nSigh.\\n\\nI called the other company my insurance covers.\\n\\nThey had it, and are shipping it out to me expedited.\\n\\nI can't believe I wasted so much time trying to get an idiot to believe something she knew she was right about.\\n\\nTL;DR I switched insurance companies. The crazy lady on the phone didn't believe me that there was a Dexcom G5 transmitter, when I've been on it for 2 years now. Insisted she was right, and that Dexcom only makes a G4 and a G6. Hung up on her while she was insisting I contact Dexcom to prove she was right. Called another company, which had it, and is shipping it to me ASAP.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello reddit users and other T1D I am new to the reddit thing and I’ve basically been looking for support since I’ve been diagnosed... all my family members who have had T1D are no longer with us so I’m fighting this by myself and blindly. \\n\\nSo let me just say that my father was diagnosed at 25 and he never took it seriously and it took his life. My grandmother (moms side) got diagnosed at like 60? Due to a car accident. Through out my life i was warned about this disease and so were my brothers, of course like the rest of us I ignored it and kept being a kid eating anything and everything. My life hasn’t been very great and a lot of it I couldn’t help because I was a kid, I’m currently 23 years old right now. Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night. You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles? Yeah I’d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes. I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day, l was even craving the most random things I’ve never craved before.. after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant! So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said “your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you’re under DKA” all I could say was ok. I called my mom and said “mom I’m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly...I have diabetes.” There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry. I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room. Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here. I don’t have insurance and my job isn’t very good, they’ve cut my hours because of how sick I’ve been. I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn’t listen to me.. she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin (Levemir, Novolog) at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM, over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm. After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir... my sugars were still sitting in the 380 - 420 I kept begging her that it’s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I’m killing myself rather than helping myself.. I ended up losing about 30+ pounds in 3 months. I was 145 lbs before diagnosed, today 1/9/2020 I’m now 114lbs and not happy at all... I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels, for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I’m not even financially stabled or have insurance. On 1/4/2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out, turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 (in June it was at 7.5) thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that’s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus! Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that’s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir ... so even when I was injecting myself with insulin.....nothing was happening ... to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I’ve been using Levemir it wasn’t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I’m doing everything I can possibly do... I want to be apart of this community and have people I can talk to when things get overwhelming, my boyfriend is my supporter but he still doesn’t fully understand how much this effects someone, is there anyone else how there who struggles to live daily because they aren’t stable I’m tired of feeling alone with this stupid sickness.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This might cause a debate, but hear me out, i’m not here to offend anyone or make fun of it by any means, cause i am a type one diabetic now since beginning of 2017. Back in December of 2016, on the 16th, i was approached by 2 males who asked me to use my phone cause they were lost, i said sure. I handed them my phone, afterwards they proceeded to tell me to empty my pockets. At first i was confused, then i realized i was being robbed. They had no weapon out at the time, but they tried to cover their face after i already seen their faces when they asked to use my phone. I’m a brown belt in karate and blue belt in brazilian jiu-jitsu, i felt like i could more than handle these guys. I threw a punch, knocked out the first guy and took the other guy down and started fighting him on the ground, 20 or so seconds go by and i felt a sharp kind of hit to the top of my head, my shoulder, my lower back, stomach, arms, at first i thought it was some brass studded knuckles, but they both got up and ran. I realized what had just happened, i was stabbed multiple times. I was very lucky to run 3 blocks to the hospital with a collapsed lung, i made it. I fell unconscious from blood loss in the front entrance of the hospital and nurses saw me and i was wheelchaired in. I woke up to many nurses and doctors working on stitching me up and pumping blood into me. Fast forward to next day. I was told the severity of the stabbing, i was stabbed 3 times in the cranium, once in the lung, 3 times in my back (they just missed my L4 &amp;amp;amp; L5 vertebrae’s) which i would of lost all motor mobility of my body, i was also stabbed in the hand, arm, shoulder, and the back of my neck. I needed brain surgery, a piece of the knife was imbedded into my skull and JUST millimetres from my brain. Surgery went great, i recovered and took me about 3 weeks before i was discharged. fast forward about one month, i started having pains on the top of my head where i had surgery, i went to the hospital and i had a very rare blood infection in my body from the dirty knife i was stabbed with. (hunting blade) and i needed to take IV medication everyday for 2 hours, they told me if i don’t take it, there’s a 90% chance i’ll die from this infection, but this medication had side effects, i didn’t want to hear it, i was too stressed out at that point. I did the IV medication for nearly 6 weeks, the infection was gone from my body. Fast forward 1 month, i’m back living with my parents, i was always tired, sleeping, no appetite and short of breath. My mom is type 2, she tested my BG and it was 27.0 mmol. She took me to the hospital right away, i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 20, weight 210, 6’2, i was healthy, ate normal, and lived a normal life. I’m now a type 1 diabetic, forever. I want opinions or to hear any feedback on this, i’m not blaming it on the medication i took, but it’s a big chance it was. Thank you for reading.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I posted a [thread here 7 months ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/bldosc/need_help_trying_to_understand_budget_us_insurance/) looking for advice about moving to the US from another country.\\n\\n\\nI've now been in the US since the end of October and healthcare is really the only thing that remains a pain in the arse.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm enrolled on my partner's work health care plan now, which is by Anthem Blue Cross (we did think initially this was Blue Shield). The plan cost $28 a month for my partner, but once I was added on the price unexpectedly went up to ~$250. This is even before getting any medication. My partner works part time, and I'm unable to work until I get my paperwork from the government, and even then who knows how long it will take for me to find work. Since I couldn't enroll in medicare we figured the only option was to go with the work benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey wouldn't tell us their formulary before signing up and we had to wait until coverage started yesterday. Upon looking, most insulins are not covered. **I am currently on Novorapid (Novolog in the US I think?) and Tresiba, both of which are listed as 'EXCLUDED' on the formulary. Humalog and Lantus are listed, however, are these the closest comparable insulins? Which combination would you recommend?**\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel really bad about how much this plan will take from my partner's pay cheque, so I was considering outright getting private coverage out of my own pocket. **Are there any good / more affordable plans out there? Or am I better sticking with my partner's coverage?** I did look at Blue Shield but I have to call to get a quote. Unfortunately, this whole thing is incredibly stressful and confusing and the only area I've kind of felt out of my depth and I keep getting more questions and I'm not sure where to head to have them answered.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few other things,\\n\\n\\n* Our understanding is we need to set up a primary care doctor first, discuss with them what I need, and they refer me to an Endo who is in our network, who then will write a prescription for me and I go and take that to a pharmacy. Is this correct?\\n\\n\\n\\n* What would be the correct course of action for going via a community pharmacy for 340b prices? Follow the same steps as above, and then sign up at the local community health centre?\\n\\n\\n\\n* Could the endo add things to the prescription that aren't listed on the formulary and I still get coverage, or is that just up to me to pay the full amount? CGMs are on the formulary as 'non-preferred', if I filled out the FreeStyle Libre form on their website, and got a prescription, do I still have to pay full price for the sensors, for example?\\n\\n\\n\\n* Which insulins have manufacturer discounts? I think most of the Novo Nordisk ones have them available, but it doesn't seem like these are covered by my insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much for your help.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Okay, so I have been using Tandem's Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all, before this experiment, I was DIY looping with Omnipod (off-label). Being off-label, this system has it's quirks, but there are a couple features, intensity, and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBefore jumping into what I like and don't like about Control IQ, I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works. \\n\\nFirst off, Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal. The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading (it's only integrated with Dexcomg G6) to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus, just be increased, no change at all, be decreased, or be completely suspended. The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes. Below is the Control IQ tier system.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n ≥  **180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg/dL within 30 minutes, there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus. The correction bolus is 60% of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg/dL every 60 minutes. This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing.\\n\\n**160 - 180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **increased**. \\n\\n**112.5 - 159 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **not changed**. \\n\\n**112.4 - 70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **decreased**. \\n\\n ≤  **70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, basal is **suspended**. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy thoughts...\\n\\nAfter about 3 days of using Control IQ, my average is higher than what I like. However there are less lows which is awesome. BUT, my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping.  The reason for this is that unlike looping, Control IQ software doesn't not use **carbs on board**. Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten.  This would be fine, if you didn't have to use the CGM reading, but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus, the Tandem pump doesn't remember how many carbs on are board. \\n\\nFor instance, I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg/dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced  bolus of 0.6 U. I then \"trying to be good\" used the recommendation. I then decided to have an apple, so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams, but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg/dL, the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin, it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg/dL. This isn't super high, but this could have been completely avoided. ALSO, I couldn't stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions, I would have been much higher. It recommended 0U, but I took 0.7U (usually I'm about 1U for an apple). \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other feature I'm not crazy about is the tube. I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years, so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D, but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice, especially during workouts. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple features I DO like...\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like that the software works, all the time. Even if it isn't nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be, I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments. With my closed loop Omnipod system, I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink (device used to connect pod to phone) and phone were connected and working. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt's also nice not to have to carry an additional device (the rileylink), but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump. So that's not a big change.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like the sleep feature. This allows for a tighter range, but doesn't allow for the automated correction bolus. However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg/dL, your basal is increased. With normal settings, basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg/dL or above. \\n\\nOh, and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem, however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOverall I think for the masses, Control IQ could be rather helpful tool. However,  I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me, but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTAKEAWAY: Control IQ is less work but doesn't allow the as tight control compared to looping. DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on, but I like the control, and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*This is just a short snapshot, I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ. I have early access to this because I'm a T1D, CDE, and a RDN. It's a bit of work to review and report, but I hope this information is helpful to you.*</td>\n",

       "      <td>My thoughts on Control IQ vs DIY LoopingOkay so I have been using Tandem s Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts amp x200B First of all before this experiment I was DIY looping with Omnipod off label Being off label this system has it s quirks but there are a couple features intensity and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem amp x200B Before jumping into what I like and don t like about Control IQ I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works First off Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading it s only integrated with Dexcomg G6 to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus just be increased no change at all be decreased or be completely suspended The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes Below is the Control IQ tier system amp x200B 180 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg dL within 30 minutes there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus The correction bolus is 60 of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg dL every 60 minutes This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing 160 180 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is increased 112 5 159 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is not changed 112 4 70 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is decreased 70 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg dL within 30 minutes basal is suspended amp x200B My thoughts After about 3 days of using Control IQ my average is higher than what I like However there are less lows which is awesome BUT my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping The reason for this is that unlike looping Control IQ software doesn t not use carbs on board Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten This would be fine if you didn t have to use the CGM reading but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus the Tandem pump doesn t remember how many carbs on are board For instance I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced bolus of 0 6 U I then trying to be good used the recommendation I then decided to have an apple so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg dL the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account amp x200B Fast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg dL This isn t super high but this could have been completely avoided ALSO I couldn t stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions I would have been much higher It recommended 0U but I took 0 7U usually I m about 1U for an apple amp x200B The other feature I m not crazy about is the tube I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice especially during workouts amp x200B A couple features I DO like amp x200B I like that the software works all the time Even if it isn t nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments With my closed loop Omnipod system I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink device used to connect pod to phone and phone were connected and working amp x200B It s also nice not to have to carry an additional device the rileylink but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump So that s not a big change amp x200B I like the sleep feature This allows for a tighter range but doesn t allow for the automated correction bolus However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg dL your basal is increased With normal settings basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg dL or above Oh and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system amp x200B Overall I think for the masses Control IQ could be rather helpful tool However I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days amp x200B TAKEAWAY Control IQ is less work but doesn t allow the as tight control compared to looping DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on but I like the control and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature amp x200B This is just a short snapshot I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ I have early access to this because I m a T1D CDE and a RDN It s a bit of work to review and report but I hope this information is helpful to you</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello all! I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer, in my case, my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons, and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue. I also take biologic meds for my illness, and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses, including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer. \\n\\nI’ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes, and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes, the illness doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the person’s daily life, and their overall ability to function and work a normal job. \\n\\nI’ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories, where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me’s in order to cover the costs of insulin, or having to resort to “Walmart insulin” (that sounds atrocious) when they don’t have insurance, and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance. \\n\\nNO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes. Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things, and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d. \\n\\nWhat are your options where you live, in the event that you don’t have health insurance? How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn’t available? \\n\\nSome states offer Medicaid, and among the states that offer Medicaid, some offer a program called “Medicaid buyin” where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market. Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid, or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid?\\n\\nRegarding employment, how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance, as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don’t have to cover health insurance? \\n\\nIf you do have a job that offers you health insurance, have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance? The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment. I don’t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person’s ability to access a life-sustaining medication, this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor, that’s it. \\n\\nI realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive, but are generally able-bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands. This would also include working long hours, as well as overtime. Someone like myself wouldn’t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes. Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized, compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities? My condition wouldn’t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds, but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn’t want to remain in that state for any length of time. \\n\\nAnd, lastly, how does your illness impact things for you socially? Are there social situations, job situations, or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative, judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you? How have strangers reacted? How have friends and/or significant others reacted?\\n\\nI live in Colorado, where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions. Here are the links for that, as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state. Your state may have a similar buyin program, I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized. \\n\\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/hcpf/medicaid-buy-program-working-adults-disabilities\\n\\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm\\n\\nAlso- feel free to ask me any questions about my autoimmune disease! I’m intrigued by science and medical stuff, and how it impacts our daily lives.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi, I’m Kaylynn. My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic. He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult. My husband takes 2 different insulin’s 1 of them is long acting Lantus &amp;amp; the other is fast acting Humalog. \\nUnfortunately &amp;amp; absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail, he has been they’re since 9-27-19 - presently. We had talked to somebody who works there, who answered questions we had, I had brought up my husband’s diabetes &amp;amp; the difficulties he faces with his diabetes, this woman “assured” me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and “knew what they were doing” They’re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different, when my husband first went in it took 2-3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him, learn about his medical conditions/medications all that stuff. He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are @ 7am he gets both Lantus &amp;amp; Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of, @ 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin’s then the night medications that were approved. Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm. That’s it. \\nOkay, now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much, please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I’m saying, is there anything I can try to do about this? Recommendations? I’d very much appreciate it. I’m lost with what I can even do about this. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙏🏻😔 I know this is really long, please bare with me, I’m new here &amp;amp; trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand. Okay here we go. \\nSo, this is what started first then so on, so on \\nI received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly “he doesn’t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I’m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn’t care. So I got up, got dressed &amp;amp; got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I’ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house. I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call &amp;amp; explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home, &amp;amp; that since you all are administrating his medications to him, calling in refills, etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills. And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail, and we don’t know when or if he’s going to be released. \\nI know this is very long so I’m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it’s very important. \\n• I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that “contact the pharmacy” because that’s not they’re responsibility. And that whoever basically is his other half, emergency contact, on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications. \\n•So what I’ve been dealing with lately is when he calls (not every call) but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left. If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won’t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up &amp;amp; then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine. \\n•These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him, that what they were wanting to do would not “help him at all” they forced him to take it and he nearly OD. So then they put him back on his original dose\\nThere’s been so much damn more. This is already long as hell. \\nSo lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin’s and put him only on Novolog 70/30 and he said no he wouldn’t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him. \\n•He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn’t know what he’s talking about having to do with his insulin, but 100% without a doubt think they know what they’re doing!! \\nThey’re wrong af, changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable. There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20-30units when his sugars to high?!?! That would kill him!!! \\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP PLEASE PLEASE DO!! I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Very Important Question If anybody could help with what they know an answer I d greatly appreciate it very much Hi I m Kaylynn My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult My husband takes 2 different insulin s 1 of them is long acting Lantus amp the other is fast acting Humalog Unfortunately amp absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail he has been they re since 9 27 19 presently We had talked to somebody who works there who answered questions we had I had brought up my husband s diabetes amp the difficulties he faces with his diabetes this woman assured me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and knew what they were doing They re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different when my husband first went in it took 2 3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him learn about his medical conditions medications all that stuff He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are 7am he gets both Lantus amp Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin s then the night medications that were approved Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm That s it Okay now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I m saying is there anything I can try to do about this Recommendations I d very much appreciate it I m lost with what I can even do about this I know this is really long please bare with me I m new here amp trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand Okay here we go So this is what started first then so on so on I received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly he doesn t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn t care So I got up got dressed amp got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call amp explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home amp that since you all are administrating his medications to him calling in refills etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail and we don t know when or if he s going to be released I know this is very long so I m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it s very important I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that contact the pharmacy because that s not they re responsibility And that whoever basically is his other half emergency contact on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications So what I ve been dealing with lately is when he calls not every call but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up amp then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him that what they were wanting to do would not help him at all they forced him to take it and he nearly OD So then they put him back on his original dose There s been so much damn more This is already long as hell So lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin s and put him only on Novolog 70 30 and he said no he wouldn t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn t know what he s talking about having to do with his insulin but 100 without a doubt think they know what they re doing They re wrong af changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20 30units when his sugars to high That would kill him PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP PLEASE PLEASE DO I DON T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was originally writing this as a comment for another post but I got too way many thoughts on this so I just had to make this it’s own thread.....\\n\\nCan I just take this as an opportunity to point out that the perception that the A1C metric of average glucose control is good? It’s not. It’s total bullshit. It’s laughable and anytime an endo excitedly pats me on the back for having a good one it immediately makes me want to look for a new endo. Which I’ve done a lot. \\n\\nTest your endo, if this metric is their only quantitative assessment of your behaviors as a diabetic then you have a shitty endo. I have met a lot of shitty endos so it’s a trigger with many indicators that I’m very sensitive too. \\n\\nAn A1C purportedly gives you a metric correlative to your long term glucose average over the past several weeks. My A1C is always amazing. Like weirdly so. But it’s not because I’m a great T1. It’s because I’m a really bad one lol. Or maybe a really good one with bad days? Or a great one? I’m not sure and that’s the point. An A1C is incapable of distinguishing whether anyone is good or bad. \\n\\nMy glucose control has two main modes of behavior on any given day. First is just very flat all day between 120-160. So pretty much perfect. A mode that would lend itself to a great A1C in the end. I drink a lot of water, run, and am very strategic about the carb quality more than the count of the carb for any given meal on these days (fast carbs = bad). A philosophy that’s never taught but yields way better control than anything an endo or diabetic educator could show you. I always assumed this good/bad carb thing is an intuition all T1s get several years into having it. \\n\\nThe second mode of glucose behavior is a day I’m active and wanting tons and tons of short acting sugary things (ice cream, cake, chocolate) combined with TONS of caffeine. These are my ‘I’m young and strong and can do tf I want days’ where I’m generally in a great mood and not giving any fucks. Not a great example of health in any light but we gotta love ourselves. Sometimes that means being self indulgent. To my point though, on these days my sugar is a harmonic set of fast moving roller coaster waves. Huge and quick glucose spikes in the high 200 to low 300 range (because it’s short acting carbs) followed by insulin over compensating followed by huge and very fast / sudden drops into lows below 50/60 (again, short acting carbs). The insulin over compensating is an intentional part of the scam too by the way. I over compensate means I get to eat more junk food in the end....As you can surmise, I should not be proud of these days. \\n\\nBut type-1 diabetics have very cool cheat codes in normal life the normie’s don’t get such as \\n\\n-huge control over our energy levels in any state of activity (marathon runners unite! set your basal to zero and cruise by everyone else 😎), \\n\\n-or our own ghetto version of Aderall (lows keep you spritely and very awake at 4am), \\n\\n-or ‘food entitlement’ so you don’t have to share your freakin’ fries. The ‘can’t share I took insulin for that sorry’ has never failed. \\n\\nI will very ashamedly exploit all of these on occasion. I will say it now, I know this paragraph will trigger people and totally agree 99% of this is horrible advice. But most of you would be lying if you said you’ve never done any of these. \\n\\nHere’s the kicker though, if an A1C is a long term average of the past several weeks what do days of repeated huge spikes and repeated huge lows average out too? Well, a spike of 260 and a low of 40 average out to 150.....a number that would if by itself be represented with a great A1C. In an aforementioned ‘roller coaster day’ this whole day would then theoretically yield an awesome A1C. \\n\\nUltimately, if these are the two main modes of glucose behavior I have then my A1C is always awesome. Tons of highs mixed with tons of lows gives you the same A1C as a perfectly flat line at 150.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So 3 days ago I was do for a pump renewal as my 5 years was up. I am a tslim user since November 24, 2014. I have had many pumps that have broken in the past, most diagnosed as a battery failure/malfunction. The broken pumps had nothing to do with anything I did wrong except for one where the screen cracked while I was sleeping.\\n\\n1 month ago I was contacted by Tandem and they told me I would be getting upgraded when my pump warranty was up in a month. The localbrep Jordyn Dooley was nice and got me all set up with a customer service rep. Both were very enthusiastic about me getting the new pump. During the last 2 weeks I went and got the dexcom G6 in anticipation for my new tslim pump.\\n\\nSo this past Monday I never got the renewal call as promised. Tuesday, no call. Now I am concerned and I called them. They tell me someone will call me back. Today I call them and I got told that they won't be issuing me a new pump and to call my doctor. I asked to speak to a supervisor because the woman on the phone was being very short and rude towards me and I could sense a very bad time in her voice. She refused to get me a supervisor and hung up. I called back and the next customer service rep, Brooke, told me there was no one at all at Tandem for me to talk to. After some back and forth with her she tells me that the Director of Sales will call me on Monday, I ask for his name and she mumbles some profanity then hangs up.\\n\\nSo now I am pretty upset and I call back again. She just keeps picking up and immediately disconnecting, and this happened like 5 or 6 times. I am beginning to have some panic attacks, this is my life and I am not calling about getting like my gutters cleaned here... I go upstairs and ask my wife to call from her phone. The customer service rep, Brooke, immediately answers and is now talking to my wife. She is extremely rude to my wife when she realizes my wife is calling to get some information for me. She gives my wife the name of the Director of Sales, Jim Simpson, but refuses to give any other info on how to contact him. Ultimately she just hangs up on my wife as well. \\n\\n5 hours later I actually get a call from Jim Simpson. He tells me I am no longer a good fit for Tandem because I am not a good look for them with all of the broken pumps I have had. I tell him that I don't be live that is very fair as the pumps that have broken were not my fault. I mean it's not like I have done anything to cause the pumps to break, I live a very normal life, although I do have many problems from my 32 years with diabetes; kidney disease, advanced retinopathy, and neuropathy. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, but that is all of the activity I am involved in, so the pumps are not put through any stress. \\n\\nWhat do I do from here? Diabetes is enough of a problem and it has been a lot on my wife and my son, on top of all of the other problems that have come from my diabetes. To be treated like this by a company that is supposed to be doing things to make life better for diabetics is extremely upsetting. I am on Medicare so I don't have many choices. I would switch to Medtronic's closed loop pump, but unfortunately Medicare won't allow me to use the Medtronic cgm, so tandem is really my only choice.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? Maybe the best thing is for my story to go viral so Tandem knows I am not just another number and I am a person, a diabetic with feelings, and a person who doesn't deserve to be treated like they don't matter. \\n\\nThank you for reading all of this if you did. 🖤🖤🖤</td>\n",

       "      <td>My daughter was diagnosed with t1d 3 months ago today.  She just turned 5 and was 4 at dx.  She takes Humalog Jr. and her basal is Tresiba she also has a Dexcom G6  It has been a struggle.  I'm trying to follow all the guidelines I was given in the hospital, but I'm also trying to figure out some things on my own.  I'm really looking for some good advice or academic resources because I want to understand specifically how the body is working.  I don't feel like her treatment team is answering my questions, they sort of ignore my concerns and tell me to change her carb ratios.  Sorry for the super long post and at least one crazy question.\\n\\n1. How can I estimate or calculate the absorption of carbs into the bloodstream?  For example, I was taught if my daughter is below 80 to give 15g carbs and check again 15 minutes later.  That seems to spike her way up into the 300's and she won't come down even with a correction dose.  If I look at it from a purely numbers perspective, I see it as pouring 15000mg carbs into about 14dL of blood.  Giving me 1071mg/dL, which obviously isn't the case because she only spikes to the upper 300s.  However, I would like to be able to estimate how many carbs are going to end up in the blood stream so I can more accurately gauge what treating a low should look like.  I'm also just interested in the biological process.  I know this will be different for different foods, but when I treat a low I always end up giving her a high.\\n2. Related to number one, I'd like to know more about the process of digestion and absorption of carbs into the body and how long the process from eating to eliminating takes.  I've gotten my daughters pre-bolus down pretty well.  Her turn happens between 20-24 minutes post injection, a 10 minute pre-bolus will yield a relatively flat line, any longer and she'll go hypo before dinner can kick in, any shorter and she starts going high and it's like her body ignores the insulin.  Here is the issue, I can almost set my watch to when her Humalog loses effectiveness, appx 2 hours post meal she steadily goes up until she levels off in the 240-260 range.\\n3. She has been having really weird and unexplained lows, usually at night.  Can anyone tell me what causes these?  Three nights in a row, hours after dinner, so presumably her fast acting really isn't active anyone, she will drop dangerously low.  She eventually dropped down to 46 last night (41 on dex; 46 on finger stick).  When I gave her a juice box she was 71 on finger stick, 15 minutes later she was 46.  So I gave her another juice box and some fruit gummies, because I was terrified.  This sent her to 400 over the course of 2-3 hours.  I don't understand how she can crash so hard without being given insulin.\\n4. Lastly, I can't seem to find an answer on this one.  Does a t1d need carbs and insulin at every meal?  Sometimes my daughter just wants eggs and bacon or a plain hot dog cut up, but I make her have toast or fries because she needs her insulin.  Is this a valid thought process?  Basically everyone I've asked says \"that's a question for the doctor\", which sucks because we only see the nurses and NP right now.  I don't get to take her to see the doctor until the end of December.  I am not in any way trying to avoid carbs, I understand the important role carbs play in the body, I'm just not sure if a carb free meal here and there should be avoided.  It would be nice if I had a chart that said \"A 5 y/o girl who is active a lot needs 60 carbs per day\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>Looking for some advice for my daughterMy daughter was diagnosed with t1d 3 months ago today She just turned 5 and was 4 at dx She takes Humalog Jr and her basal is Tresiba she also has a Dexcom G6 It has been a struggle I m trying to follow all the guidelines I was given in the hospital but I m also trying to figure out some things on my own I m really looking for some good advice or academic resources because I want to understand specifically how the body is working I don t feel like her treatment team is answering my questions they sort of ignore my concerns and tell me to change her carb ratios Sorry for the super long post and at least one crazy question 1 How can I estimate or calculate the absorption of carbs into the bloodstream For example I was taught if my daughter is below 80 to give 15g carbs and check again 15 minutes later That seems to spike her way up into the 300 s and she won t come down even with a correction dose If I look at it from a purely numbers perspective I see it as pouring 15000mg carbs into about 14dL of blood Giving me 1071mg dL which obviously isn t the case because she only spikes to the upper 300s However I would like to be able to estimate how many carbs are going to end up in the blood stream so I can more accurately gauge what treating a low should look like I m also just interested in the biological process I know this will be different for different foods but when I treat a low I always end up giving her a high 2 Related to number one I d like to know more about the process of digestion and absorption of carbs into the body and how long the process from eating to eliminating takes I ve gotten my daughters pre bolus down pretty well Her turn happens between 20 24 minutes post injection a 10 minute pre bolus will yield a relatively flat line any longer and she ll go hypo before dinner can kick in any shorter and she starts going high and it s like her body ignores the insulin Here is the issue I can almost set my watch to when her Humalog loses effectiveness appx 2 hours post meal she steadily goes up until she levels off in the 240 260 range 3 She has been having really weird and unexplained lows usually at night Can anyone tell me what causes these Three nights in a row hours after dinner so presumably her fast acting really isn t active anyone she will drop dangerously low She eventually dropped down to 46 last night 41 on dex 46 on finger stick When I gave her a juice box she was 71 on finger stick 15 minutes later she was 46 So I gave her another juice box and some fruit gummies because I was terrified This sent her to 400 over the course of 2 3 hours I don t understand how she can crash so hard without being given insulin 4 Lastly I can t seem to find an answer on this one Does a t1d need carbs and insulin at every meal Sometimes my daughter just wants eggs and bacon or a plain hot dog cut up but I make her have toast or fries because she needs her insulin Is this a valid thought process Basically everyone I ve asked says that s a question for the doctor which sucks because we only see the nurses and NP right now I don t get to take her to see the doctor until the end of December I am not in any way trying to avoid carbs I understand the important role carbs play in the body I m just not sure if a carb free meal here and there should be avoided It would be nice if I had a chart that said A 5 y o girl who is active a lot needs 60 carbs per day</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all. First of all this is my first post here so I'd just like to say thank you. I've been reading so many posts from you all over the past 8 weeks. It's been helpful and insightful so thank you.\\n\\nI'll give you a little background to start with. \\n\\nMy 3 year old son was diagnosed with T1D about 8 weeks ago. We'd taken him to the Doctor due to a lack of any real appetite and lots of trips to the toilet for a wee. They did a quick urine test and found sugar. So onto the finger prick test and they found his blood sugar at 23 and sent us straight to hospital to get started with Insulin. Just like that my son was a diabetic. I'm sure you all know how the story goes....\\n\\nSince then we've been dosing him with 2.0U of Levamir every morning. And an insulin to carb ratio that has dropped considerably over this last 8 week period. We started with a 1U insulin to 15g of carbs. That was steadily increased and was sat at 1U to 35gc over the past 4 weeks. Im happy to go into more detail on the numbers if required anyway but I'll leave it at that for now. \\n\\nLast Wednesday, he started being sick uncontrollably, as if he'd picked up a stomach bug. This carried on for around an hour while we attempted to keep his blood sugars up through any means necessary. He ended up going to hospital with a blood sugar of 2.7 by the time we go there. Straight on a drip over the next 24 hours due to this severe hypo which we thought was brought on by his sickness. The more we have thought about it though, why would he drop so low so quickly? We were a little confused. \\n\\nWe got him home on the Thursday night and everything seemed to be getting back to normal but on the Sunday night he took another downward turn and started being sick again. Another bad hypo and a call for an ambulance. They ended up giving him a glocogen injection to increase his bloods enough to temporarily make him alert again. Again we wondered why he'd dropped so severely. Was his food just sitting in his stomach so the insulin was then just causing the hypo? On top of the sickness as well. \\n\\nThe next part of all of this is where it gets really weird. We've brought him home yesterday after 4 days in the hospital where he'd been back on the drip and managed to start eating enough for them to let him out. Since Sunday night though, we haven't given him Insulin at all. We've only given him 1.5u of Levamir which has now been dropped to 1.0u. His bloods have not been outside of a normal range since Sunday night when he had the last hypo. How is that happening? \\n\\nMy mind is doing overtime trying to work out what the hell is going on with my sons body. So many questions. Is he cured? Was he ever diabetic? Will it come back? Did he throw up his diabetes? Was it something else like a kidney infection and the diagnosis was completely wrong but the hospital stay has accidentally helped him cure whatever it is that was actually wrong with him? \\n\\nI'm over the moon my boy is back at home. But I'm a little Confused at the moment. If any of you lovely lovely people can help me and my family out with some experiences or advice then we'd be so grateful you've no idea. \\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read. These words are just a literal brain dump so apologies if some of it is confusing. I'll happily answer any questions :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>My 3 year old son is showing signs of remission Very confusedHi all First of all this is my first post here so I d just like to say thank you I ve been reading so many posts from you all over the past 8 weeks It s been helpful and insightful so thank you I ll give you a little background to start with My 3 year old son was diagnosed with T1D about 8 weeks ago We d taken him to the Doctor due to a lack of any real appetite and lots of trips to the toilet for a wee They did a quick urine test and found sugar So onto the finger prick test and they found his blood sugar at 23 and sent us straight to hospital to get started with Insulin Just like that my son was a diabetic I m sure you all know how the story goes Since then we ve been dosing him with 2 0U of Levamir every morning And an insulin to carb ratio that has dropped considerably over this last 8 week period We started with a 1U insulin to 15g of carbs That was steadily increased and was sat at 1U to 35gc over the past 4 weeks Im happy to go into more detail on the numbers if required anyway but I ll leave it at that for now Last Wednesday he started being sick uncontrollably as if he d picked up a stomach bug This carried on for around an hour while we attempted to keep his blood sugars up through any means necessary He ended up going to hospital with a blood sugar of 2 7 by the time we go there Straight on a drip over the next 24 hours due to this severe hypo which we thought was brought on by his sickness The more we have thought about it though why would he drop so low so quickly We were a little confused We got him home on the Thursday night and everything seemed to be getting back to normal but on the Sunday night he took another downward turn and started being sick again Another bad hypo and a call for an ambulance They ended up giving him a glocogen injection to increase his bloods enough to temporarily make him alert again Again we wondered why he d dropped so severely Was his food just sitting in his stomach so the insulin was then just causing the hypo On top of the sickness as well The next part of all of this is where it gets really weird We ve brought him home yesterday after 4 days in the hospital where he d been back on the drip and managed to start eating enough for them to let him out Since Sunday night though we haven t given him Insulin at all We ve only given him 1 5u of Levamir which has now been dropped to 1 0u His bloods have not been outside of a normal range since Sunday night when he had the last hypo How is that happening My mind is doing overtime trying to work out what the hell is going on with my sons body So many questions Is he cured Was he ever diabetic Will it come back Did he throw up his diabetes Was it something else like a kidney infection and the diagnosis was completely wrong but the hospital stay has accidentally helped him cure whatever it is that was actually wrong with him I m over the moon my boy is back at home But I m a little Confused at the moment If any of you lovely lovely people can help me and my family out with some experiences or advice then we d be so grateful you ve no idea Thank you for taking the time to read These words are just a literal brain dump so apologies if some of it is confusing I ll happily answer any questions</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to get some feedback on why I still chose not to use blood sugar sensors. Have they improved? If so, please let me know. I have been a diabetic since 2006, and I'm now 20 years old. I'm a 3rd year electric engineering student and have played tennis in college for 2 years.\\n\\n*Disclaimer: I used the Dexcom G6 a year ago, please let me know if they have since solved any of the following issues*\\n\\nAbout a year ago I tried the dexcom G6, and was overall disappointed with my experience, here's why:\\n\\n1.) Alarms that you can't turn off\\nI understand that the FDA mandates having an alarm for low blood sugar that can't be turned off, but I found that it made the dexcom system especially annoying to use. I was in a digital logic class, and my blood sugar went below the alarm threshold; it was about 50. So obviously I knew about it and was actively treating the low blood sugar with snacks, but the alarm kept going off periodically throughout the class about 3 times total within a 45 minute period). \\n\\nAre there better ways to manage this feature now? In my opinion, this feature alone makes the system not viable for a professional user (someone who has to attend meetings or college classes) because it disrupts everything and gets everyone's attention. My argument for having the option to eliminate this feature is that a manual blood sugar meter doesn't make sound at all - it doesn't even know what your blood sugar is unless you test it!\\n\\n2.) accuracy and delay\\nFrom my understanding, the blood sugar sensor doesn't measure blood sugar directly, it reads a from secondary source (present in the body) which is a good indicator of blood sugar. When I used the dexcom, the blood sugar readings would only update every 5-10 minutes, and they wouldn't be as accurate as a normal blood sugar meter. I believe this is a huge issue for treating lows, because that is where accuracy and delay become very important. A blood sugar difference of 50 and 70 means two completely different things as far as treatment goes. With a 50 I need to eat something immediately and with high sugar content. With a 70  can get away with making a piece of toast (will be more sustaining after my blood sugar has recovered).\\n\\n3.) Can you save data over a long period of time, on a smart device, and perform statistical analysis on that data? \\n\\nI study engineering, so, if I really wanted to I could take all my blood sugar readings, plug them into excel, and have excel run distributions, averages, peaks, etc. Why don't I? That takes way too much time. I think since Dexcom already takes the data for you, it should have the option to add measurements. For instance, you could say \"I want to know my average blood sugar over the last 2 weeks\" to siri or google assistant, and your phone should just be able to tell you based on the data from the dexcom app. If this isn't a possibility right now, I think a bunch of smart engineers would easily be able to figure it out. Engineers at Google are smart enough to track everyone's online profile and use it for ad tracking, they could easily take data that is already stored in the dexcom app, perform calculations on that data, and display it to a user. \\n\\nAnother application of this would be to display \"danger zones\", where blood sugars typical reach their maximum and minimum on a daily basis. So your phone would tell you: \"hey, based on data from the last month, 2 times a week you have low blood sugars around 3pm, consider lowering your dose for lunch\". I think this is achievable. Has anyone tried to log this autonomously using the current Dexcom system? Please let me know your thoughts, and thanks for reading.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been t1d for nearly 7 years, always had what my doctors call very good control (a1c under 7, usually around 6 since about a year after diagnosis). I'm on a pump and have dexcom g6 that I use constantly (and my parents follow my dex). Since I was diagnosed when i was already a very independent 12 year old, I took the lead on my diabetes management and have pretty much done everything myself for the last 7 years. My parents are there to support me, and my mom has helped me fight with insurance, deal with bad pump sites, bleeders, etc. They're incredibly helpful and my biggest supporters in everything. \\n\\nHowever my mom is really controlling. She has her own anxieties and issues, which she tends to project onto me. Basically she texts and bothers me constantly when my sugar is &amp;gt;180, even though I don't need a reminder to deal with a high and we've discussed that. In high school it wasn't too bad, since I was home a lot and she could see that I was bolusing for the highs or changing my pump site out when I needed to. \\n\\nNow I'm a freshman in college, living in the dorms. I live 20 minutes from my parents (which I'm okay with, I like my school), so it's not as if they couldn't get to me if something happened--and my school is in a big city, 10 minutes away from my doctors and some amazing hospitals, so if anything serious happened I'm literally 10 minutes away from the nearest emergency care. \\n\\nwe talked about it before I left and agreed that when I'm low, I get a simple \"you ok?\" text from mom or dad (or both), and if I don't answer within 15 minutes they can call me to check in. When I'm over 200, we agreed that they could text me **once** after about an hour if my sugar isn't budging. \\n\\nMy mom totally does not go by this agreement and I'm furious. when I'm high, she texts me once, asking if I'm okay. Once I say yes, she gives it another 30 minutes before saying \"it's not budging?\", then continues to text me again and again every 30 minutes at least to ask whether I'm changing my site, if I'm handling it, what I'm doing, etc. \\n\\nI feel like diabetics understand that sometimes, you just get those stubborn-ass highs that don't go away no matter what you try!! And now that my stress levels are back up from hard classes, and it took me months to adjust to the dining hall diet, new sleep schedule, and new friends, those stubborn highs have been coming up more frequently. \\n\\nso yeah, I don't have straight lines on my dexcom anymore. whatever. I'm happier, my doctors have said multiple times that they have no concerns and I'm doing great, and my last a1c a couple months ago was 6. \\n\\nmy mom STILL won't leave me alone, even after I tell her how much it bothers me. When she constantly bugs me and asks what I'm doing about my sugars, it makes me feel like she thinks I'm incapable of handling things on my own, even though I've been doing it for years. I know she's coming from a place of genuine concern and worry, but it feel so hurtful. A few months ago she even asked if I was intentionally making my sugars high and not correcting them (It was a few times in one week that they were never over 350, and always came down within a few hours). I was so furious that I didn't even yell, I just sternly told her that I would never do something like that and was incredibly hurt that she thought something like that when I've been doing really well emotionally. \\n\\nSorry for this being long, she's texting me as I write this and it's infuriating. I do have a therapist and plan to bring this up w her next session, but I won't be seeing her for another week.\\n\\nTL;DR My mom constantly texts me when I'm over 200, won't leave me alone no matter how much I ask, and makes me feel like I'm not capable of handling my own diabetes. My a1c is 6 and my doctors are super happy with my current control.</td>\n",

       "      <td>M 55 y.o., 5' 10\", 168 lbs.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with type 1 some 44 years ago. I guess I have achieved \"Crafty Veteran\" status. ;-)  The treatment of diabetes was far different back in the mid70s.  The disposable needles were new to the scene.  The three types of insulin (L, R, and NPH) were taken from pigs and cows.  Blood monitors didn't exist.  Rather, there was this test tape you would have to pee on to see your approximate blood sugar level within the last 6 hours.  Unreliable.  There was one major sugar-free soda: Tab, which was pretty awful but I learned to love.  As a kid receiving a diagnosis the doctors and nurses approached it with unreasonable expectations.  \"No sugar ever. No birthday cake with friends, no ice cream in the summer, no s'mores at the campfire, no Halloween candy, no Trix and Cap'n Crunch, nothing. Ever. No!\"  They forced you into hiding your occasional Oreo birthday dalliances rather than help you deal with the blood sugars when they became raised.  The standard then was to count calories by using an \"exchange\" diet.  There would be a diet set up for you by a dietician who factored in your caloric needs based on age, growth rate, activity level, etc.  Every single day you would eat the same types of food in the same quantities because the types of insulin would be most effective this way.\\n\\nThe needles on the syringes were 27 gauge about four times as thick as the 31 gauge needles today.  The first consumer level blood monitor hit the market around 1977 and it wasn't easy.  You would be fortune to get a reading within 8 minutes.  The machine was quadruple the size of today's monitors so packing it to take with you was an ordeal.  It required calibration every time you turned it on, a two minute process.  You then had to do a trial run with a solution that had a preset level of sugar.  If the reading was within a specified range the machine was good to go.  After calibration and successful testing you inserted the test strip which required a HUGE drop of blood. Too little wouldn't work and you would have to toss the test strip.  By this time the machine would often shut off and you'd have to start from scratch.  After adding the big drop of blood to the test strip you had to rinse it after 30 seconds being careful not to do it early or wait too long.  Then, after another minute or so it would give you a reading.  Ugh!\\n\\nThe pig based insulin was scary.  The human DNA origin insulin of today is very user friendly.  That old stuff would cause reactions that were extreme.  It interfered with my ability to think, often causing incoherent actions, spasms, and a loss of verbal communication to the point that I only could speak two words: \"yes\" and \"no\".  The human insulin reactions are a walk in the park comparatively.  The reactions would slowly set in until it flipped an on/off switch in my thought processes.  During a severe reaction people would always ask questions but they were yes/no questions.  \"Are you okay?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you need help?\"  \"No!\"  The concerned people would gather around because they could tell something wasn't right.  I would get defensive because my brain was misfiring and because I was surrounded by a dozen unfamiliar faces all talking about me.  I only got kicking-people-away violent once but that's once too many.  I have been ejected out of stores and restaurants and classrooms until I could \"pull yourself together, man.  Why are you doing drugs and coming in here, dude?\"\\n\\nThe way things have progressed and advanced in the treatment of diabetes is quite remarkable.  Things are easier now.  My time anymore isn't overwhelmed with strict dieting and monitoring and freaking out about misinformation.  I have been told my whole life that a remedy for the condition is just around the corner, maybe even in a couple years.  I am still waiting patiently.  haha\\n\\nI handle my diabetes with Admelog and Basaglar pens.  I am an archaeologist by trade so I have no capability to use insulin pumps that can be crushed, lost, or yanked out deep in the jungle where disease is abundant and cleanliness is unexpected.  I do not get A1C readings more than once a year because I am on MediCal that doesn't support super attentiveness to health.  It's a program that endorses simple maintenance rather than aggressive proactive treatment.  My A1C readings have been in the 7 to 8 range and I am pleased with that.  I count carbs and adjust the insulin according to the quantity of food I eat which varies from day to day.  I am afforded enough test strips to test twice a day and I do well with it.  My kidneys and eyes are functioning like new.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: I’m a fairly healthy guy. Tall and very lean, 6’4 and 175 pounds. I run  20k a week. \\n\\n\\nAs I am writing this up it is from a hospital bed in the intensive care unit. I took insulin for a nothing special meal (sandwich and veggies). Took the insulin on my way home so I was primed to eat when I walked in the door. 20 min later I am standing in front of the fridge and then ....NOTHING. I’m gone. I black out....I assume I then fell on my back on the concrete floor of my Kitchen. I passed out from a low blood sugar. Not a new story yes, we’ve all heard of this happening to people before. \\n\\nThe next parts are where it gets weird. \\n\\nI was completely unconscious with a blood sugar below the 40s according to my continuous Dexcom G6 .....for 6 hours. I woke up  at 3am the next day. When I woke up ....I couldn’t feel anything below my waist. I couldn’t move my legs. I was weak and barely conscious. I managed to eventually pull my body with only my arms to some fruit snacks downed 30g of carbs and just continued laying on my floor until  it kicked in. \\n\\nAt this point, I thought the legs thing was really weird but I’ll get control back I guess when my sugar is up. Right? No. Sugar was up 20 min later and I was still paralyzed. I was now going delirious from panic. Did a ‘Hey Siri Call...’ to my best friend to calm me down. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I didn’t know how to fix it. I was powerless. I was an athletic runner who couldn’t move his legs anymore. I was screaming in my head. \\n\\nHe calmed me down and got an ambulance to me. All my doors were locked so I dragged myself to the door with my arms to let them in. They got me to the ER.\\n\\nIt turns out I was suffering a combination of a swollen spine from compaction on a solid floor for 6 hours. The compression in my lower spine shut off innervation of my nerves into my legs. This 6 hours of compaction also compacted all the tissues in my body with contact to the solid ground. This lead to something called Rhabdomyolysis. \\n\\nThis is the extremely high accumulation of dead cells within the body. The typical person has anywhere between 50-250 u/ml at any time (A Calcium-Klinaise blood panel [CK]) just standing around doing nothing . Athletes can get up to maybe 1,000 u/ml after a strenuous workout. \\n\\nMine clocked in at 79,800 u/ml at the ER. They immediately began to   F L U S H  my body with saline. 400 ml of fluids every hour in the ER. Nuero comes in and tells me the situation, ending it with warning me that I may never walk again. This was all 5 days ago.\\n\\nI’m still alive. I can wiggle my toes now and have full control over everything but my ankles essentially. The rate of progress would suggest its only a matter of days or hours before I can work them fully. I mostly can now. But not entirely. \\n\\nBut it doesn’t end there! Remember at the beginning when I said I weigh 175 pounds? That was 5 days ago.  I now 264 pounds. I have a muffin top lol. I’m huge everywhere. My dick got so thick I now have a foreskin again. Turns out they overdid the saline treatment. By a lot. My CK is now in the normal range. My kidneys are above average health. I’m ready to leave. But they pumped so much fluids into me it’s effecting my mobility. My legs are so swollen I cant really move anything easily. \\n\\nThey admitted to over doing it so now they’re giving me some kind of water pill (diuretic) that will make me lose all of these fluids in 48 hours. \\n\\nUltimately, what I learned to respect from this is that lows are EXTREMELY dangerous. More than I think I took seriously. The cost could be death. Also extremely severe is what you go through if you’re lucky enough to live. \\n\\nTLDR; Severe Rhabdomyolysis from passing out from Hypoglycemia. It’s very very bad and the treatment is nearly just as bad.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My ex gf of 1 day has diabetes. Prior to meeting her, I had never met anyone with diabetes, and didn't really know anything about it - in fact, I was one of those \"does that mean you can't eat sugar?\" people.\\nBut, it didn't take long, with some explaining by my ex, for me to get an understanding of what living with t1 diabetes meant.\\n\\nMy ex was sort of at a point in her life where she was trying to get things back on the right track, get away from the drugs and excessive partying, and try to be more responsible about her future. This was one thing I really appreciated about her, and I could tell she was doing a lot of it for me.\\n\\nBut there was one thing that always bothered me about her, and kind of had something to do with our eventual break-up, and that was how she handled her diabetes. Within the first week of us sleeping together, I experienced her having hypoglycemia, and having to run to the store to buy sugar, because I didn't have any food at home, and she was suddenly literally blind (that was the only time she said she lost vision.) However, her having hypoglycemia was a frequent occurrence.. like.. almost daily at some point. I would wake up to her alarm going off on her phone, and she wouldn't move for minutes, and remained sleeping. When I'd ask if her blood sugar levels were low, she'd deny it, either annoyed or in a baby voice. If I asked her to check, it would be low, and I'd have to try to get her to take her grape tablets. Well, in a perfect scenario, this is how it would go, but usually what would happen is she would refuse to check her blood, I'd spend 15 minutes convincing her to do it herself, or let me do it, and then spend another half hour pleading with her to take a grape sugar tablet or something.\\n\\nThings actually got better further into our relationship, but it was always on my mind that she wasn't doing enough to take care of her diabetes. I'd often wonder, at times when she was being especially playful or silly, if her blood sugar levels were off, and it was causing me a lot of stress. The biggest thing for me was that she hadn't gone to the doctor to try to get a cgm or something. Like, to me, I couldn't fathom why she wouldn't want a device that would relieve her from having to prick her fingers all day, and that would guard her from dropping into dangerous levels. It seemed like it would be a huge improvement in her quality of life, and it would help me not have to worry about her diabetes all the time.\\nBut she wasn't being proactive enough about it.. and I just couldn't understand, and it frustrated me. How can I be with someone who doesn't seem interested in having control of a lifelong condition that they have?\\n\\nSo in our last argument, I brought it up, and I said it had been bothering me for the longest time. She got very offended, and said I was being mean and selfish for telling her that her diabetes was a problem in the relationship. I told her it wasn't the diabetes, it was the way she was handling it, but she wasn't listening; she told me I didn't understand what it was like living with diabetes, and that hypoglycemia, and the unpredictable behavior that came with it, was something that would be with her forever, and it was unfair and cruel of me to use it against her.\\n\\nAnyway, I did some looking around on the web today, and tried to put myself in her shoes - because if I had t1, I'd definitely want a modern cgm and app combination with bells and whistles to minimize my stress and care. But.. unless I'm completely mistaken, the current cgms don't seem as modern as one would expect, and it looks like a lot of people on this sub still prick their fingers, and still have trouble controlling their glucose levels... And it's making me wonder if I was wrong all along, and that a gcm or something wouldn't actually have helped all that much, and that she wasn't being as irresponsible and careless as I thought :(</td>\n",

       "      <td>Was I too harsh on my ex girlfriend about her diabetes My ex gf of 1 day has diabetes Prior to meeting her I had never met anyone with diabetes and didn t really know anything about it in fact I was one of those does that mean you can t eat sugar people But it didn t take long with some explaining by my ex for me to get an understanding of what living with t1 diabetes meant My ex was sort of at a point in her life where she was trying to get things back on the right track get away from the drugs and excessive partying and try to be more responsible about her future This was one thing I really appreciated about her and I could tell she was doing a lot of it for me But there was one thing that always bothered me about her and kind of had something to do with our eventual break up and that was how she handled her diabetes Within the first week of us sleeping together I experienced her having hypoglycemia and having to run to the store to buy sugar because I didn t have any food at home and she was suddenly literally blind that was the only time she said she lost vision However her having hypoglycemia was a frequent occurrence like almost daily at some point I would wake up to her alarm going off on her phone and she wouldn t move for minutes and remained sleeping When I d ask if her blood sugar levels were low she d deny it either annoyed or in a baby voice If I asked her to check it would be low and I d have to try to get her to take her grape tablets Well in a perfect scenario this is how it would go but usually what would happen is she would refuse to check her blood I d spend 15 minutes convincing her to do it herself or let me do it and then spend another half hour pleading with her to take a grape sugar tablet or something Things actually got better further into our relationship but it was always on my mind that she wasn t doing enough to take care of her diabetes I d often wonder at times when she was being especially playful or silly if her blood sugar levels were off and it was causing me a lot of stress The biggest thing for me was that she hadn t gone to the doctor to try to get a cgm or something Like to me I couldn t fathom why she wouldn t want a device that would relieve her from having to prick her fingers all day and that would guard her from dropping into dangerous levels It seemed like it would be a huge improvement in her quality of life and it would help me not have to worry about her diabetes all the time But she wasn t being proactive enough about it and I just couldn t understand and it frustrated me How can I be with someone who doesn t seem interested in having control of a lifelong condition that they have So in our last argument I brought it up and I said it had been bothering me for the longest time She got very offended and said I was being mean and selfish for telling her that her diabetes was a problem in the relationship I told her it wasn t the diabetes it was the way she was handling it but she wasn t listening she told me I didn t understand what it was like living with diabetes and that hypoglycemia and the unpredictable behavior that came with it was something that would be with her forever and it was unfair and cruel of me to use it against her Anyway I did some looking around on the web today and tried to put myself in her shoes because if I had t1 I d definitely want a modern cgm and app combination with bells and whistles to minimize my stress and care But unless I m completely mistaken the current cgms don t seem as modern as one would expect and it looks like a lot of people on this sub still prick their fingers and still have trouble controlling their glucose levels And it s making me wonder if I was wrong all along and that a gcm or something wouldn t actually have helped all that much and that she wasn t being as irresponsible and careless as I thought</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ok long story short, I was flying from New Jersey to San Diego with United. When we went to board they said there was no over head space for our bags so they had to be checked. Fast forward to about an hour being on the plane I felt myself having high symptoms. I check my blood sugar and it reads \"HI\" that's it. So I know it's over 600 so I go for my bag under the seat and I can't find my insulin. I start to panic a little and I tell my brother. The guy sitting next to us mentioned that maybe they have insulin in the first aid kit. So I go up to the attendant and ask \" hey do you guys have any insulin?\" And she said yes. I was shocked honestly. She also said a doctor or nurse had to administrate it, when she said that I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I've been diabetic for 13 years, I can give administrate my own god damn insulin. So she gets the first aid kit, turns out there is no insulin in there. Great. The person in front of me happens to have some novolog pens and he so kindly gives me one. Now keep in mind those pens say \"single patient use only.\" So they are calling doctors on the ground to determine how much insulin they should give me even though I already told them how much I usually take in this situation. So they finally give me the ok to inject 10 units, literally after an hour of having the insulin available. Literally what I told them I usually do. They monitor me for a little and finally it's 580. So I'm like \"hey, can I take the pen?\" And they said the EMTs will have to decide. So I get off the plane and EMTs are waiting there, keep in mind, I'm completely fine. So I tell them I don't need any assistance but I would like to take the pen with me, considering it will be disposed of and unused. It's the same insulin I use so I didn't see the issue, plus I talked to the guy that have it to me and he said I could keep it. I also offered to pay the co pay of the pen in which he declined. The EMTs would not give me the ok and neither were the flight attendants. So I'm arguing with them back and forth and it was clear they were not going to give it back to me. So I left pissed off. Do I have a possible law suit? Or do I have the right to be upset? Please give me your thoughts on the situation. Thanks</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi I’m new to reddit, and have never had a diabetes support network before. I’m hoping to find perspectives from other T1’s on coping  with and managing expectations around Diabetes care with family.\\n\\nI’ve had T1 for 15 yrs and am married to the kindest most loving and helpful husband. S.O is super great and supportive with T1. He understands it, we eat well, culturally diversely, and life is good. I will add that his parents are kind loving humans who treat me with respect and none of the discussion to come is due to ill intention on their part. Also We are an interracial family. I am culturally Indian and that is it’s own set of separate challenges.\\n\\nThe issues arise when with his parents who are a classic meat and potatoes American family. They eat relatively unhealthy per diabetes standards (lots of pasta, rice, cheese, meat, dairy, not enough non-starchy veg) and it’s been a challenge for me to speak up for my dietary needs. They don’t understand the effort diabetes takes and stress that comes with an unplanned food life. Mostly his dad isn’t interested in discussing food, no curious about my diabetes needs. They live in rural Maine where access to restaurants or other kinds of food is very limited, except for, you got it- classic burger/pizza joints. I have attempted to communicate my needs and assist with meal planning, even cooking meals for the whole family. I’ve tried bringing my own snacks along and requesting they stock the house with healthier snacks (not just crackers, cheese, pretzels, sausages). I feel uncomfortable asking them to adjust their way of life for me, but at the same time dread spending time with them when my FIL mocks my husband and I attempts to eat healthier/lower carb and more vegetarian, meal plan, or any thing else that makes eating with diabetes easier. \\n\\nIt is stressful enough to manage my dietary requirements on vacation (2-7days) away from home and it’s made worse when their habits are so health wise and culturally different and they don’t recognize or empathize the struggles I face. My MIL is responsible for the food in the family, and she tries to help (buys sugar free ice cream, or low sugar pie for example) but at the end of the day, they enjoy pasta and meat WITH bread on the side. I mostly suck it up and eat what is served, trying to avoid overloading the carbs. It hurts my feelings as if they don’t care enough about my dietary needs, and it extends to me feeling I am uncared for/unloved. \\n\\nIs it ok to request to eat separate meals? Or request they modify their diet a little for the few times a year we spend together? This situation is damaging my relationship with them and I am so bitter and resentful. My husband recently brought this up with his parents and they were extremely offended saying I was insulting the way they eat and their way of life. They didn’t at all validate or understand the challenges that come with living and eating with diabetes. It’s extra challenging because they are my in-laws, not my parents, and are not required to love me in the same way. \\n\\nHas anyone else experienced this? Feeling unsupported by family? How can I help my in laws understand and care about my diabetes when we are together? Any ideas would be great at this emotionally challenging time. \\n\\nLove!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi,\\n\\nMy diabetes has been making me feel so wrecked recently. I am seeing my endocrinologist on Monday but my insulin wont work like it used to as of a week ago. I am taking double, sometimes triple, the needed dose to bring my blood glucose to where it needs to be. Ive tried different batches of insulin.\\n\\nI had to leave a friends birthday early tonight because I checked my blood glucose and it was randomly sky rocketing at 12.5mmol. I dont want to go through a night of high sugars because the way I feel now it will make me way too sick. And that gets me so down, the fact I have to leave events for things like this because of a sugar level that wants to randomly jump up. Its irritating because I measured my carbs, I took the correct insulin dose, I even took my long acting insulin, and this should definitely keep my sugar level stable, but no, it sky rockets.\\n\\nThis whole week ive just felt disgustingly nauseous and 'swollen' if that makes sense.   \\n\\n\\nSome may think of ketones, but ketones shouldnt affect the bodys ability to absorb insulin so how does it explain blood sugars that require almost three times the regular dose to come down?\\n\\nThe truth is I stupidly went on a keto diet (50g of carbs a day) without any professional medical advice beforehand. What I think happened is this:\\n\\nI reduced my carb intake dramatically to the point where I was taking 6 units a day TOTAL of fiasp for meals and 15 units of tresiba. Before keto, I was taking 6-12 units of fiasp PER MEAL, and 30 units of tresiba a night. I was on the reduced insulin for 2 weeks while doing a keto diet, and noticed my blood glucose going crazy when I had a cheat meal of a piece of naan bread with my food, 2 weeks into the diet. That is when I noticed my blood sugar would not go down when injecting the required amount of insulin I would usually need for this, resulting in me having to dose three times the usual amount, and now the same for each meal which has carbs in it. In turn, the large doses of insulin make me feel physically rough. \\n\\nI have only ever had this problem once in my life, and this was directly after a trip to Japan. I returned home and my insulin would not work properly. I saw my endocrinologist who was not sure why, but had changed my humalog to fiasp and the fiasp worked for me. Similarly to my situation now, when I returned that time from Japan I had eaten a lot of food, more than I would normally eat in a single meal in Japan, and this triggered my insulin to stop working for some reason.\\n\\nIt has just made me feel so sick this week and I had a trial shift for a new job today and was ready to quit but stuck through it (I got the job)\\n\\nJust wondering if any other t1 diabetics have gone through this, and what you think it might be. Sometimes my diabetes gets me down but I remember all the diabetics who don't have access to medical care and it reminds me to remain humble and count my blessings, but sometimes I just wish we could lift this weight off our shoulders. \\n\\nSome more info:  \\n\\n\\nWeight: 75KG\\n\\nHeight: 5' 8\\n\\nGender: Male\\n\\nAge: 29\\n\\nT1 Diabetes: 22 years</td>\n",

       "      <td>OK, this is gonna be a long one. \\n\\nUsually when I exercise, I tried to eat before my workouts and/or take bolus shot. I can manage my sugars with no insulin and/or food if it's a light exercising, but that's another story.\\n\\nNow I have moderate/high intensity workouts for about 2 hours later in the evening (when my insulin sensitivity is quite high). \\n\\nI am also now on a slight calorie deficit or maintaining daily amount, but surely try to avoid surplus/weight increase. That being said, I particularly cut the carbs, try to consume about 80g of carbs at most (that's including low's). \\n\\nWith this diet (I am used to it, have done it before) my glucose levels are quite stable and in the range (80-130mg/dl) through the day. Next, before I start my workout (warm up phase is about 30-40 minutes in 50-80% HR zones), my glucose is in the range of 110-125mg/dl. Plus, I have not consumed any carbs for at least last 3 hours before the workout. \\n\\nAfter the warm up (40 minutes) my glucose is already about 180mg/dl. So the question is: **how to deal with this (hoping to get some scientific info behind too)? And why it is increasing?**\\n\\nI pose these questions because usually if my glucose is in the range (80-130mg/dl), and I do light exercising (50-70% HR), it keeps dropping, and I need to eat something. So, ok, maybe in this case since I am in the 70-80% HR zone, and sometimes for short periods of time even above 80%, the glucose starts increasing, because I reach anaerobic state that requires more glucose for energy compared to low level exercising. Does it increase because I have not had any carbs for a while, and the body starts to consume stored reserves for energy? And since I have not had any bolus, the body delivers glucose to bloodstream, but it is not delivered because there is no insulin to deal with it? Does this sound right?\\n\\nBut now the next question: **If I take a bolus shot (2 units) some 40 minutes before the workout without any snack, will the glucose remain relatively stable (of course, it will not be perfect, but considering that timing is right etc.)? Or in this case because of the bolus shot, it will simply start to drop (=since bolus is injected, it keeps delivering glucose from blood to cells, and my sugar level drops. BUT (!!!) since there is insulin present that delivers glucose to cells, my body does not trigger release from the stored reserves, and I end up with a hypo???)?** \\- I am not sure about science behind this one. \\n\\nYes, I have a sensor, yes, I can take a time out and have a snack if my glucose drops, yes, I can also have a snack and shot before the workout regardless etc. But my goal is to cut some weight (necessary for sport), plus, ending up with a low is quite annoying because taking a snack complicates everything during my workouts. I also want too avoid snacking before/during workout, because it's more difficult to manage my glucose anyway in this case, and I may end up with a higher glucose reading than those 180mg/dl, and then again I have no energy, am out of breath soon, and my workout is shit. I hope to get some feedback based on experiences and/or scientific material to read that may explain this particular case in detail. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nP.S. After those 40 minutes of warm up when my sugar has increased to 180mg/dl, it starts dropping again (typical for me during long aerobic types of exercises), but still during this rise at first I feel that I lack energy at some point. So how to have energy without going LO/HI and avoiding eating carbs? If that is possible at all?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Managing glucose during workoutOK this is gonna be a long one Usually when I exercise I tried to eat before my workouts and or take bolus shot I can manage my sugars with no insulin and or food if it s a light exercising but that s another story Now I have moderate high intensity workouts for about 2 hours later in the evening when my insulin sensitivity is quite high I am also now on a slight calorie deficit or maintaining daily amount but surely try to avoid surplus weight increase That being said I particularly cut the carbs try to consume about 80g of carbs at most that s including low s With this diet I am used to it have done it before my glucose levels are quite stable and in the range 80 130mg dl through the day Next before I start my workout warm up phase is about 30 40 minutes in 50 80 HR zones my glucose is in the range of 110 125mg dl Plus I have not consumed any carbs for at least last 3 hours before the workout After the warm up 40 minutes my glucose is already about 180mg dl So the question is how to deal with this hoping to get some scientific info behind too And why it is increasing I pose these questions because usually if my glucose is in the range 80 130mg dl and I do light exercising 50 70 HR it keeps dropping and I need to eat something So ok maybe in this case since I am in the 70 80 HR zone and sometimes for short periods of time even above 80 the glucose starts increasing because I reach anaerobic state that requires more glucose for energy compared to low level exercising Does it increase because I have not had any carbs for a while and the body starts to consume stored reserves for energy And since I have not had any bolus the body delivers glucose to bloodstream but it is not delivered because there is no insulin to deal with it Does this sound right But now the next question If I take a bolus shot 2 units some 40 minutes before the workout without any snack will the glucose remain relatively stable of course it will not be perfect but considering that timing is right etc Or in this case because of the bolus shot it will simply start to drop since bolus is injected it keeps delivering glucose from blood to cells and my sugar level drops BUT since there is insulin present that delivers glucose to cells my body does not trigger release from the stored reserves and I end up with a hypo I am not sure about science behind this one Yes I have a sensor yes I can take a time out and have a snack if my glucose drops yes I can also have a snack and shot before the workout regardless etc But my goal is to cut some weight necessary for sport plus ending up with a low is quite annoying because taking a snack complicates everything during my workouts I also want too avoid snacking before during workout because it s more difficult to manage my glucose anyway in this case and I may end up with a higher glucose reading than those 180mg dl and then again I have no energy am out of breath soon and my workout is shit I hope to get some feedback based on experiences and or scientific material to read that may explain this particular case in detail amp x200B P S After those 40 minutes of warm up when my sugar has increased to 180mg dl it starts dropping again typical for me during long aerobic types of exercises but still during this rise at first I feel that I lack energy at some point So how to have energy without going LO HI and avoiding eating carbs If that is possible at all</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wondering, is there any research or information about manipulating the dosage of basal insulin?\\n\\nI know, many will say that I should not do that, but I am quite experienced with all the diabetes stuff and not afraid to try.\\n\\nOK. I do exercise a lot, I have cut my insulin dosages down to 30% of prescribed daily amounts (this has nothing to do with rationing, it's just my weird obsession of being healthy and avoid injections as much as possible). Since my workouts are very demanding, and I want to make very workout effective, I have started a new approach how to deal with managing glucose levels during the workout - taking large amounts of basal insulin **(I was originally prescribed 24 units, used to use 14 units due to my exercising and diet, now I use 30-40 units per day)**. \\n\\nWhy do I do this?\\n\\nI learned that higher amounts of basal insulin:\\n\\n* lower the glucose relatively rapidly (if the dosage is high),\\n* increase sensitivity towards rapid acting insulin (ok, maybe not sensitivity, just their interaction causes glucose to drop),\\n* in the long run through the day glucose levels drop after each meal, and I feel that cells receive energy even though at first glucose may be high\\*.\\n\\n\\*this is basically the main reason - with high dosages of basal insulin I can still perform well during my workouts even if my glucose level is quite high/higher, while with managing glucose with rapid insulin before/during workout is more complicated (those who exercise know what I am talking about - you can follow the same pattern, but glucose will be different any different day :( ). Besides, taking high basal dosages help me to sleep during the night - even if glucose is high (300), I d not need to wake up several times a night to go to bathroom; whereas, if I take my regular/decreased basal dosage and manage glucose level with rapid insulin, I must wake up and go to bathroom even if my glucose is only 130. I have had serious problems with sleep, and it is very important for me to have a rest; therefore, I gladly use this option. \\n\\nSo finally, the question: what are effects of this type of experimenting that I do? Does using very high dosages of basal can lead to some problems/complications in general (like increased insulin resistance and stuff)? Does the state when my glucose level is around, let's say, 300 while on a high dosage of basal affect my kidney's\\*\\*, liver, caterpillars, eyes, neural/nervous system etc?\\n\\n\\*\\*This part I find kinda hilarious, because, I mean, if the sugar is 300, then surely body wants to get rid of it, and that should be stress on all organs that deal with getting it out of the system, but then why I have no need to go to pee in this case?\\n\\nI tried to research, but did not find anything that could give any insight how mad/normal it is to do something like that? If someone can explain and state facts why this is really bad for my health, I can quit it immediately, but so far I do not see any reason to stop this experimenting. I can still manage my glucose with rapid insulin, but it is more inconvenient, and especially more difficult in the mornings when insulin resistance is higher (dawn effect or whatever etc.), and in general I feel weaker while on a high basal dosage I feel quite excellent. \\n\\nP.S. I know about dangers taking such high dosage before night, and hypo's that can occur, but I can manage that easily. \\n\\n**P.P.S. Disclaimer!!! I have type 1 for 22 years since my childhood, so I have a hold of this, but I highly do not recommend to follow this pattern to anyone here who does not have EXCELLENT understanding in managing diabetes, dieting, and others affects that can trigger high's or low's!!!**</td>\n",

       "      <td>Experimenting with basal insulinWondering is there any research or information about manipulating the dosage of basal insulin I know many will say that I should not do that but I am quite experienced with all the diabetes stuff and not afraid to try OK I do exercise a lot I have cut my insulin dosages down to 30 of prescribed daily amounts this has nothing to do with rationing it s just my weird obsession of being healthy and avoid injections as much as possible Since my workouts are very demanding and I want to make very workout effective I have started a new approach how to deal with managing glucose levels during the workout taking large amounts of basal insulin I was originally prescribed 24 units used to use 14 units due to my exercising and diet now I use 30 40 units per day Why do I do this I learned that higher amounts of basal insulin lower the glucose relatively rapidly if the dosage is high increase sensitivity towards rapid acting insulin ok maybe not sensitivity just their interaction causes glucose to drop in the long run through the day glucose levels drop after each meal and I feel that cells receive energy even though at first glucose may be high this is basically the main reason with high dosages of basal insulin I can still perform well during my workouts even if my glucose level is quite high higher while with managing glucose with rapid insulin before during workout is more complicated those who exercise know what I am talking about you can follow the same pattern but glucose will be different any different day Besides taking high basal dosages help me to sleep during the night even if glucose is high 300 I d not need to wake up several times a night to go to bathroom whereas if I take my regular decreased basal dosage and manage glucose level with rapid insulin I must wake up and go to bathroom even if my glucose is only 130 I have had serious problems with sleep and it is very important for me to have a rest therefore I gladly use this option So finally the question what are effects of this type of experimenting that I do Does using very high dosages of basal can lead to some problems complications in general like increased insulin resistance and stuff Does the state when my glucose level is around let s say 300 while on a high dosage of basal affect my kidney s liver caterpillars eyes neural nervous system etc This part I find kinda hilarious because I mean if the sugar is 300 then surely body wants to get rid of it and that should be stress on all organs that deal with getting it out of the system but then why I have no need to go to pee in this case I tried to research but did not find anything that could give any insight how mad normal it is to do something like that If someone can explain and state facts why this is really bad for my health I can quit it immediately but so far I do not see any reason to stop this experimenting I can still manage my glucose with rapid insulin but it is more inconvenient and especially more difficult in the mornings when insulin resistance is higher dawn effect or whatever etc and in general I feel weaker while on a high basal dosage I feel quite excellent P S I know about dangers taking such high dosage before night and hypo s that can occur but I can manage that easily P P S Disclaimer I have type 1 for 22 years since my childhood so I have a hold of this but I highly do not recommend to follow this pattern to anyone here who does not have EXCELLENT understanding in managing diabetes dieting and others affects that can trigger high s or low s</td>\n",

       "      <td>I apologize in advance for the long post\\n\\nSome background:\\nLast A1C: 7.4\\nDiagnosed 9 years ago\\n17F\\nHave severe anxiety, have been on birth control for the past four months (I don’t know if these affect things)\\nI use the Medtronic 670g, with the sensor.  Humalog insulin.  \\n5’5 and 150 lbs (my weight rarely fluctuates, but recently I’ve dropped to about 146)\\nI eat a relatively healthy diet (minimal carbs, try to fill my plate with proteins and low carb fruits/veggies but I will have half a cup of brown rice or a slice of whole wheat bread regularly.  I also eat dairy)\\nVery active lifestyle\\n\\nSo I just finished a season of drum corps, and am starting marching band.  Both pretty physical activities (drum corps we spent upwards of 12 hours rehearsing in the sun each day). Towards the end of season (about two weeks ago) I began getting lightheaded/dizzy during rehearsals.  I would also get stomach cramps after eating and very nauseous throughout the day.  I had to go to urgent care for it, and after checking my out they found nothing wrong.  I’d checked my ketones, and they were never above 0.2 (I figured the trace amounts were just the burning of fat from the constant physical activity)  After getting back it seemed to have gotten better, but the first day of band, about an hour into rehearsal I got extremely nauseous and dizzy.  On my way to the nurse I ran into her and she told me that I was extremely pale and my lips were white.  My vision went blurry and o had to sit.  I was better after sitting down some time.  Of course, she pulled me out of band and said I needed to go to the doctor before coming back, so I did.\\nAt the time I went to the nurse my glucose was 169.  About two hours after, when I was at the doctors, my blood sugar had risen to 300.  Doctor took my blood, checked everything else and I seemed fine but have to wait for lab results.  I came home, checked my ketones and I was at 0.4 so I drank a ton of water and tried to flush them.  Later my blood sugar is 182 and my ketones are at 0.8.  Cue more insulin and water.  Then they drop to 0.3.  Blood sugar is still around 180.  About two hours later I check before bed and my blood sugars steadily rising to 200, and not responding to insulin corrections.  I check ketones and it’s 1.2.  Eventually I just decided to inject about six units of insulin (I’d been using my pump prior) and drink another bottle of water.  My blood sugar finally drops.  I wake up and it’s at 59.  But MY KETONES ARE STILL AT 0.7.  At this point I just said fuck it and went about my day.  I’m still very nauseous and dizzy, and while I was allowed back to band I had to sit out a lot.\\nThe doctor calls back, and apparently everything is completely fine (we have to ask for my A1C tomorrow cause they didn’t tell us) besides my high blood sugar.  I don’t know why I feel so sick still, and it’s extremely frustrating.  My blood sugar also is right back to 270 right as I wanted to sleep.  It was 190 before dinner (vegetarian sushi), and roughly below 150 the entire day before that.  I’ve tried calling my endo, but had to talk to a different one from the hospital who just gave the stock “drink water and give insulin” stuff and didn’t read into any of my other symptoms.  I’m hoping maybe other diabetics might recognize something??  This is very frustrating especially with my mother being the kind of person who just believes everything off the internet and keeps accusing me of not having good control or saying I have DKA or something (Pretty sure if I had DKA for two weeks straight, I’d be dead.)</td>\n",

Will edit with conversions and for grammar when I get to my computer later today.\\n\\nHistory and disclaimers before you yell at me: I’ve been type 1 for 4.5 years, and am a very research-driven person, so am trying to be careful and gather a sh*t ton of anecdotal + peer-reviewed tips before I do something stupid and hurt myself. I have a Dexcom G6 which is my greatest love in this world and keeps me sane and safe. I have pretty awesome control, especially recently as I get my mental health and other physical health issues under control (recent a1c of 5.7 with very few lows which is insane progress for me!) but as I exercise more, I’m finding myself having to lower my basal *and* still eat 75g of carbs with no bolus just to stay afloat sometimes. My endo and I have discussed that this could be solved by switching to a pump from MDI so I can suspend my basal as needed, but insurance problems are slowing this process down. And yes, I am in frequent contact with my endo and am going back to meet in person in 2 weeks, which is why I want to do my own research now so I can bring it to our next discussion!\\n\\nRight now, improvement with my bg numbers isn’t my primary goal as I am finally happy with where I am for the most part. I am interested in keto, though, as maybe if I switch to fat burning for fuel I will avoid the occasional necessity of eating so many carbs(?!). Anyone have experience with this as a T1d? I’ve read some about this but have specific questions if you’re willing to share: how long did it take to get into ketosis? How low did/does your blood sugar get before you get into ketosis? Have you gone low going into ketosis, and have you figured out how to avoid this?\\n\\nI have intermittent fasted in the past (20/4, OMAD) and am very interested in doing a longer fast (5+ days, and as diabetes allows of course) for the benefits of autophagy for other health issues. Has anyone done this? I have found a grand total of one peer reviewed study on T1Ds doing 24+ hour fasts, but I’d love to hear from you.\\n\\nI’ve reduced my basal so much at this point because of exercise I feel like I genuinely would need to stop using it to avoid hypos assuming I started fasting at a reasonable bg # (maybe 150+ ? Again I’m guesstimating based on previous experience with intermittent fasting.) I don’t want to stop my basal completely without doing a shit ton of research and talking with my endo of course. This seems crazy to me? I’ve historically been the person who struggles with highs more than lows, but now that I’m exercising a lot more I’m eating and eating carbs to just stay around 100. Suspending basal is normal, though, for you pump users right? So theoretically if I truly didn’t need insulin on a fast I could be okay? Or does this still put me at risk for DKA, even with in range blood sugars and with a proper and careful refeed to ensure blood sugars don’t spike while in ketosis? \\n\\nI guess this is a brain dump for me as much as it is asking for help. \\n\\nI’d love to hear \\na) your thoughts on the mess my brain has left above \\nb) your experience with t1d + keto and/or fasting of any type, and \\nc) if you feel the need to yell at me for considering getting rid of my basal please do but please back it up with sources because I’m having such a hard time finding them myself!\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you, and much love.

       "      <td>Hey there fellow insulin addicts, I'm a longtime lurker and wanted to share my experience with looping. I'll break it down as simple as possible.\\n___________________________________________\\n**Devices**: iPhone X, Omnipod w/Riley Link, Dexcom G6\\n___________________________________________\\n**History**: I am an active 23 y/o and have had t1d for ~7 years now. I've always kept my bloodsugar somewhat under control having an A1C in the 7's. Not the best not the worst. I had an endo appointment before I started looping and had a nightmarish 7.9 A1C. Luckily for me, I had the riley link coming to my door step soon. (it takes over a month to get the riley link)\\n___________________________________________\\n**Setup**: The setup is the hardest part. You'll need to have a handle on scripting in the MacOS terminal (PM for help, I'm somewhat of a computer nerd), If you're a non-Mac user, the process gets even harder. You'll need to learn how to download and install the latest version of MacOS on a virtual machine (VM) to install the loop app on your iPhone (once again, feel free to PM me for help). You're going to run into errors and it's going to take way more time than you'd like to get this baby purring. \\n___________________________________________\\n**Immediate Thoughts on Looping**: If I had to rate the system, I'd give it a 5/5 any day of the week. I've been looping for over a month now and am almost always in the 90-120mg/dL range, its absolutely incredible. I've managed to get my A1C down to 6.4 in just one month.\\n\\nThe beauty of looping is that the software constantly has eyes on your bloodsugar and will increase/decrease basal rates accordingly. Like the omnipod, it will recommend bolus (looping bolus is more accurate than omnipod bolus though) to fix bloodsugar. An amazing feature of the loop app is having high and low boundaries, you can tell the app to keep you between 75mg/dL-120mg/dL and it does a fine job doing that. Possibly the most black magic part of the whole system, you'll need to find your insulin sensitivities ([link with guide on setting that up](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/settings/settings/#3rd-insulin-sensitivity-factor)). Insulin sensitity is the most important part of looping that can be overshadowed - it runs the whole show.\\n___________________________________________\\n**Final Thoughts**: To me, the worst part about being t1d is waking up to high or low bloodsugar and having to take care of it; inevitably, it will make you feel *off*. Since looping, I've been waking up to 100mg/dL every single day and never shooting up or down throughout my day. I feel incredible. I never go to bed wondering if I'm going to wake up in extreme ranges. I recommend this non-FDA approved system to anyone who wants to have their diabetes stablized and improved while putting in less effort than before. \\n___________________________________________\\n**Notable links**: [Loop Website](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/), [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup)\\n___________________________________________\\nThank you for you're time - please feel free to ask as many questions as you need.

       "      <td>First, some context: I am a 27-year-old female T1 diabetic. I've had T1 since I was 2 years old, so essentially it is just part of my life. Current A1C is 6.8, am using a Medtronic PARADIGM™ 530G and Dexcom G6 CGM. Paradigm is now out of warranty, and conveniently failed at the beginning of the month, so I am currently on a Minimed loaner Paradigm.  \\n\\n\\nI guess this is more of a vent of dealing with Minimed and also looking for advice of how to deal with them in the future given my situation. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**First call to Minimed:** Unfortunately, my insurance United Healthcare is pals with Minimed and won't let me go for the t Slim x2 like I wanted. So I am stuck with upgrading with Minimed yet again. Since getting the loaner pump they have been blowing up my phone, texting me, calling me, emailing me, and CALLING MY MOM to upgrade my pump. This is while I'm looking at my options (surprise, Lol, United gives you none!) and maybe a week after receiving the loaner (you get a 3 month period with it before you get slapped with a charge). \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI get back to them and the woman I'm working with says \"Oh by the way, your phone goes straight to voicemail.\" YES, because you've left me 2 messages today! Anyways... I give them my insurance info, they tell me they will check with my insurance to make sure the pump is covered, I say okay, and assume they will get back to me to let me know what is covered. Surprise again! I just get an email saying that I owe nothing (good) and that the pump in the shipping queue...So guess I am stuck with it. Fine, whatever. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Second call to Minimed:** I'm a little upset to see that the pump is in the shipping queue without them talking to me first and I just re-upped on Dexcom G6 supplies and Minimed wants to send the Guardian sensor to me either A.) When the warranty on the G6 runs out (3 months; the first associate wanted me to get back to them with the dates of expiration so they could send the Guardian out after), or according to this second call associate, B.) They want to pay me $200 to switch immediately and I would pay $100 out of pocket for the Guardian. This associate is pressing me to take option and saying they don't like to ship the pump and sensor separately. I convince him that to just send the pump and say I'll get back to them with the date of expiration because no way am I paying $100 for the Guardian after just paying $100 for the Dexcom refill. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The real issue:** I don't want the Guardian sensor, just the pump. I want to continue treatment with the Dexcom G6 which I have used since October and love. I have had the CGM Minimed put out with the Paradigm (little over 4 years ago) and absolutely hated it... Waking up in the middle of the night to deal with incorrect readings, calibrating constantly, the sensor kinking under my skin, the list goes on and on. I see that other people are STILL having these issues with the Guardian 3 and I don't trust it enough to relay info to the pump that will change my insulin rates. No thanks, don't want to be stuck with a subpar product for a year when I have the best luck with the G6. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHow do you convince MiniMed that you DO NOT want the Guardian sensor and will use the pump in its basic functions? I really just want an insulin pump. They can't force me to take the Guardian, right? Do I reaaaaallly have to go to training for the pump and CGM? Does anyone have positive experience with the Guardian sensor, or have had both the G6 and Guardian? \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n**Tl;dr** How do you deal with Minimed pressing you to get the Guardian sensor when you absolutely don't want it and are happy with the Dexcom and using the 670G pump? Does anyone have similar experiences?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've had the last 3 go bad on me. One of them without ever warming up. I'm new to the G6, and after 4 years of G4 sensor perfection (never had one go bad in first 7 days), i'm a little discouraged.\\n\\nI've been a tSlim user for 2-3 months now, and really like the G6's near-perfect accuracy. the suspend function on the tSlim has kept me alive and sleeping very well. I love the system....when it works.\\n\\nThe last 3 sensors stopped without any notification. Just.....stopped. One minute I have a data stream, next time I look, nothing. Just a trend line gap. No notifications, no alarms, no notices of any kind. The CGM History just says \"Sensor Stopped\" and the time. Like i pressed the 'stop' button. One sensor lasted 4 days, another died during warm-up (that one did give me a 'failure' error), and this last one another 2 days. First 2 were in my arm, and was the first time i've put them there. the last one was in my stomach where I've been wearing the G6 for 2 months problem-free and used the G4 for 4 years without a hitch. I'd like to give the arm another try and rest my gut, but.....maybe not.\\n\\nThe situations where they failed have no commonality. Once out walking, once sitting reading to my kid before bedtime, and once out eating.\\n\\n2 different Lots.\\n\\nI do not use the Dexcom iPhone app. It's been on my phone, and occasionally hooked into the sensor, but my Bluetooth is usually off. That's because with the tSlim, i'm getting double notifications. There is no real gain to using the app, I'll just download the data manually. But it would lock onto it a few times a day, randomly. I do not think that cycle impacted this.\\n\\nI gently brush the applicator pad in Mastisol prior to insertion. But i'm careful to not get it around the wire or insertion site itself. there should be no impact or effect from it.\\n\\nFWIW, I tried to 'restart' them a variety of ways, even by putting my tSlim in a Faraday bag for a couple of hours. No use. the sensors were dead.\\n\\nThis is frustrating as shit. Dexcom agreed to send me new ones, but still, this is no way to manage care. I'm about to go back to the G5 and just use my phone. The suspend on the tSlim works great, but i'll just set alarms and wake myself (and my wife) up again. the endless cycle of calling customer support to get replacements filled is cumbersome and annoying. The G4 worked perfectly for 4 years (and up to 17 days at a time..). I cannot believe this is an improvement.\\n\\nI read the posts, and know I'm not alone with sensor failures. Reddit users are a small part of the overall T1 community, so I can only imagine the failure rate of these things. But still, 3 in a row? from different lots? The math makes it improbable. I feel like i'm doing something wrong.\\n\\nIf anyone has any history like this and identified an issue with the tSlim or G6 that i'm missing, please let me know.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey,\\n\\nContext: I'm a 23 y.o. T1D since 1998 (age 2), on Freestyle Libre CGM, injecting Fiasp at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and now since saturday Tresiba (new long-acting insuline, \"degludec\") around 10pm. Before that, I've used most of my life glargine long-acting insuline (Lantus), but had issues with it not lasting the promised 24 hours and thus having spikes at the end of the afternoon / before dinner so my endo recommended Tresiba, which is supposed to last around 40 hours while still taken daily (don't really know how they made it so the doses don't stack up, but that's irrelevant I guess).\\n\\nDoubt that's relevant, but I'm also currently taking 150-200mg a day of Alprazolam and Venlafaxine once a day, and had been before the switch to Tresiba with no change in my BS (except less \"stress spikes\").\\n\\nOther tidbit is that I'm living in France and this recent switch to Tresiba unfortunately coincides with the super heat wave we're having right now, so maybe that's related.\\n\\nMy problem is that I basically don't get how this new insulin works *at all*. My endo said the conversion Lantus to Tresiba should be roughly 1:1, but to err on the safe side at first.\\n\\nI have the 200u/ml pen version; since that was not super clear and neither my endo nor my pharmacist acknowledged that there exists 2 versions (100u/ml pens, like with Lantus, and this 200u/ml), when I first tested it on saturday I injected around half my usual Lantus dose (18), so 10 of Tresiba, just to be safe. It was a disaster and I massively spiked at the end of the night and had to correct in the morning. No other spikes during the day. So the next night, I tried with 14u, and had exactly the same results. Next night, tried 18u, and still, massive spike in the morning. Now I've read that dose adjustments with Tresiba may take up to 3 days to be fully effective, but I've already injected 18u for the last three days, and there's still absolutely no difference compared to the first day when I tried 10. My BS is relatively stable (around 120-150) before bed and till 4am, then spikes super quickly and I wake around 8 or 9am at 300-400! With Lantus, it was the opposite, as my BS used to go down a bit (~70-80) around 6-7am before dawn effect took over.\\n\\nIt feels like there's somewhat a long-acting insulin in effect during the day because other than correcting for the morning spike, I've had no need to adjust any other Fiasp dose during the day. Except I still have the same spikes at the end of the afternoon that I had with Lantus.\\n\\nBasically I'm completely lost. I have no idea why I spike like that during the night with this Tresiba, and going from 10u to 18u seemed to have no effect at all, neither with the morning spikes nor with the rest of the day. What's happening? Could the heat affect the insulin in the pen? (I keep my pens in my room once opened and not in the fridge, but never had any heat-related issue with any kind of insulin before. Is Tresiba more sensitive to heat?)\\n\\nHas anyone switched from Lantus to Tresiba and had similar issues?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recently started on Tresiba not sure how it works Hey Context I m a 23 y o T1D since 1998 age 2 on Freestyle Libre CGM injecting Fiasp at breakfast lunch and dinner and now since saturday Tresiba new long acting insuline degludec around 10pm Before that I ve used most of my life glargine long acting insuline Lantus but had issues with it not lasting the promised 24 hours and thus having spikes at the end of the afternoon before dinner so my endo recommended Tresiba which is supposed to last around 40 hours while still taken daily don t really know how they made it so the doses don t stack up but that s irrelevant I guess Doubt that s relevant but I m also currently taking 150 200mg a day of Alprazolam and Venlafaxine once a day and had been before the switch to Tresiba with no change in my BS except less stress spikes Other tidbit is that I m living in France and this recent switch to Tresiba unfortunately coincides with the super heat wave we re having right now so maybe that s related My problem is that I basically don t get how this new insulin works at all My endo said the conversion Lantus to Tresiba should be roughly 1 1 but to err on the safe side at first I have the 200u ml pen version since that was not super clear and neither my endo nor my pharmacist acknowledged that there exists 2 versions 100u ml pens like with Lantus and this 200u ml when I first tested it on saturday I injected around half my usual Lantus dose 18 so 10 of Tresiba just to be safe It was a disaster and I massively spiked at the end of the night and had to correct in the morning No other spikes during the day So the next night I tried with 14u and had exactly the same results Next night tried 18u and still massive spike in the morning Now I ve read that dose adjustments with Tresiba may take up to 3 days to be fully effective but I ve already injected 18u for the last three days and there s still absolutely no difference compared to the first day when I tried 10 My BS is relatively stable around 120 150 before bed and till 4am then spikes super quickly and I wake around 8 or 9am at 300 400 With Lantus it was the opposite as my BS used to go down a bit 70 80 around 6 7am before dawn effect took over It feels like there s somewhat a long acting insulin in effect during the day because other than correcting for the morning spike I ve had no need to adjust any other Fiasp dose during the day Except I still have the same spikes at the end of the afternoon that I had with Lantus Basically I m completely lost I have no idea why I spike like that during the night with this Tresiba and going from 10u to 18u seemed to have no effect at all neither with the morning spikes nor with the rest of the day What s happening Could the heat affect the insulin in the pen I keep my pens in my room once opened and not in the fridge but never had any heat related issue with any kind of insulin before Is Tresiba more sensitive to heat Has anyone switched from Lantus to Tresiba and had similar issues</td>\n",

       "      <td>I just really need to rant to a community that understands this stress.\\n\\nI’ve had the g6 for 3 months. When I needed to do my first reorder of sensors they were on backorder and dexcom could not put in the request because they needed to do a pre-authorization. After only a month! They so graciously overnighted them once the authorization came in so I didn’t run out and I thought wow they’re great.\\n\\nMy second month of reordering came around and I wanted to call way ahead of time to make sure I would get them even with a backorder and the time it takes to ship (5-7 business days). They said they couldn’t put the order in yet so it would take another week. This would put me on my third sensor. As we all know sensors last 10 days. So by the time I can order I SHOULD get my sensors but there was a 10 day backorder... convenient. Again they so graciously decided to overnight me 1 free sensor and my month supply once the backorder was fixed.\\n\\nMy third month of reordering. I cannot get ahold of my representative. I called everyday for 5 days so I decided to call customer support. They tell me they’ve taken note of all of my calls (cool but they don’t call me back?) and then tell me they can’t reorder more sensors until my signed prescription is sent back to them form my doctor. I’m confused and frustrated because I had just given them a prescription 3 months ago. They don’t have that one on file... they have the prescription for the g5 (which I never bought because I couldn’t afford it) that was sent to them a year ago! Still confused I ask how they’ve been sending me supplies for a g6 when that prescription is for a g5 and they try to tell me it was written for both. \\n\\nWell I again ask for an overnight as soon as they get the prescription back. I called them and my doctors for 3 days before they receive it and to my surprise they’re on backorder. However, after they receive the prescription they tell me I still have one order left on my old prescription that they will send immediately (couldn’t have told me the first time?). I tell them along with this purchase I need a new transmitter. I notice in the invoice they didn’t put the transmitter in the order so I call my representative and again no answer so I call customer support. They tell me they need chartwork from my doctor of my blood sugars last month. I tell them I don’t have documentation of my blood sugar because I’ve been on the g6. They tell me no problem just have the dr notate that and it should be fine. So I’ve called the dr office everyday and they keep telling me they haven’t received it. \\n\\nI resort back to dexcom TODAY and they say they’ve sent the request on the 21st, 24th, and today. They also failed to mention but brought it up today that I need to have bloodwork done too in order to allow them to submit and order. Blood work of what?? I just had it done 3 months ago!\\n\\nSo I’m furious. I needed to change my sensor yesterday, so I do. I go to put in the sensor code and then it asked for my new transmitter code. Confused, I put in the same code of my old transmitter hoping it’ll work until I get the new one. Nope not the case. So now I have wasted $60 on a sensor, and who knows when I’ll get this transmitter. \\n\\nI finally contacted Costco and will be paying full price for a transmitter because dexcom fucking sucks. Luckily they have a rebate at the moment and the transmitter is almost have it’s normal price.\\n\\nrant over.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dexcom rantI just really need to rant to a community that understands this stress I ve had the g6 for 3 months When I needed to do my first reorder of sensors they were on backorder and dexcom could not put in the request because they needed to do a pre authorization After only a month They so graciously overnighted them once the authorization came in so I didn t run out and I thought wow they re great My second month of reordering came around and I wanted to call way ahead of time to make sure I would get them even with a backorder and the time it takes to ship 5 7 business days They said they couldn t put the order in yet so it would take another week This would put me on my third sensor As we all know sensors last 10 days So by the time I can order I SHOULD get my sensors but there was a 10 day backorder convenient Again they so graciously decided to overnight me 1 free sensor and my month supply once the backorder was fixed My third month of reordering I cannot get ahold of my representative I called everyday for 5 days so I decided to call customer support They tell me they ve taken note of all of my calls cool but they don t call me back and then tell me they can t reorder more sensors until my signed prescription is sent back to them form my doctor I m confused and frustrated because I had just given them a prescription 3 months ago They don t have that one on file they have the prescription for the g5 which I never bought because I couldn t afford it that was sent to them a year ago Still confused I ask how they ve been sending me supplies for a g6 when that prescription is for a g5 and they try to tell me it was written for both Well I again ask for an overnight as soon as they get the prescription back I called them and my doctors for 3 days before they receive it and to my surprise they re on backorder However after they receive the prescription they tell me I still have one order left on my old prescription that they will send immediately couldn t have told me the first time I tell them along with this purchase I need a new transmitter I notice in the invoice they didn t put the transmitter in the order so I call my representative and again no answer so I call customer support They tell me they need chartwork from my doctor of my blood sugars last month I tell them I don t have documentation of my blood sugar because I ve been on the g6 They tell me no problem just have the dr notate that and it should be fine So I ve called the dr office everyday and they keep telling me they haven t received it I resort back to dexcom TODAY and they say they ve sent the request on the 21st 24th and today They also failed to mention but brought it up today that I need to have bloodwork done too in order to allow them to submit and order Blood work of what I just had it done 3 months ago So I m furious I needed to change my sensor yesterday so I do I go to put in the sensor code and then it asked for my new transmitter code Confused I put in the same code of my old transmitter hoping it ll work until I get the new one Nope not the case So now I have wasted 60 on a sensor and who knows when I ll get this transmitter I finally contacted Costco and will be paying full price for a transmitter because dexcom fucking sucks Luckily they have a rebate at the moment and the transmitter is almost have it s normal price rant over</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi reddit,  \\n\\n\\nI was diagnosed with t1 about 2 months ago. Been treating it with the help of a doctor and insulin with decent results (blood sugars down from 350+ during diagnosis around 70-120, working slowly towards the sweet spot of 83). Had some unpleasant lows on the way but hey its a learning process right.   \\n\\n\\nMy situation shortly: The 3rd world country where I live in has only one company for medical apparatus related  to diabetes, MedTronic. I am trialing their insulin pump 630G for about a week now and the thing is amazing. Every time I get to sit down for a meal and have to push a few buttons instead of injecting insulin manually I feel very happy. Nothing bad to say about the pump. However the constant blood glucose monitor from MedTronic (believe its called Guardian Connect? the one that works with the 630G anyway..) is a little bit less impressive. I like the \"suspend on low\"-feature a lot, just wish the monitor was a bit more accurate.   \\n\\n\\nMedTronic rep suggested I look into getting the newer 670G from my home country (about 10 hours flight away, I visit once or twice annually) as its a newer model and might be cheaper there - the country where I live in taxes diabetes apparatus highly. From what I understood there is also a better CGM from MedTronic out there using a newer sensor (Guardian 3, the one Im using with the 630G is the older model from I understood)? Wouldnt mind making the switch to that, if its better than the Guardian Connect/630G combo.\\n\\nANYWAYS! A few things I was hoping I could get answers to...  \\n\\n\\n1) Is it convenient to buy the newer version of the pump (670G) from my home country and use it where I live about 10 000 kms away? How often are you guys needing replacements for the pump, how often do they break down, etc? I do have support from MedTronic in the country where I live in now, as in spare parts etc, but if I needed a new pump in case the old 670G breaks down that would take time, I assume 2 weeks or so. MedTronic said they can give me a replacement pump if that happens (would be a 630G I assume), and that they can find a way to send the general spare parts needed for the pump and monitor (sensors, etc) to the country where I live in so that shouldnt be an issue.  \\n\\n\\n2) How much of an improvement is the Guardian 3-sensor from the CGM sensor that works together with the 630G? How much of an improvement is the 670G from the 630G? I read that 670G should be more automated and can increase basal if sugars look high which I like. Ive read some mixed reviews on reddit about the 670G though.  \\n\\n\\n3) Is it silly to buy a pump that has no support in the country I live in? For example my home country has Omnipod for sale but the country where I live in has 0 support for it, so Id have to fly 10 000 kilometres every time I want a new pump or more spare parts. Guess that doesnt work out? I wouldnt want to fly the distance more often than once every 6 months.  \\n\\n\\n4) How about using the 630G (or 670G) for pump but another CGM such as DexCom G6? How much am I missing out by not having the pump and the CGM work together, as in how much am I missing out by not having the system adjust basal automatically?   \\n\\n\\nIm not entirely sure if I can even buy a DexCom since in my home country (Finland) Omnipod and DexCom dont sell products to private patients directly and Im not entitled to healthcare in Finland anymor since Im not a resident. So Im not sure if a doctor would even treat me/assign the CGM for me even if I pay for it fully. But I could look into it. DexCom has no operations or support in the country I live in fwiw.   \\n\\n\\nInsurance is not a consideration, it will not pay anything for me in neither country. So I will pay for all costs for pump and CGM and spare parts.  Money is not an issue. I just want the best machines/the best combination of a pump+CGM I can get that is convenient for me. Ive been talking with the MedTronic reps about the logistics of pulling this thing off but I dont expect to get non-biased opinions from them-would be good to hear what reddit thinks. I think Im getting the hang of this diabetes thing pretty well, just a few things I could use help with. Thanks a lot in advance for replies :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recently diagnosed T1 Living in a 3rd world country with limited options Advice regarding medical apparatus needed Hi reddit I was diagnosed with t1 about 2 months ago Been treating it with the help of a doctor and insulin with decent results blood sugars down from 350 during diagnosis around 70 120 working slowly towards the sweet spot of 83 Had some unpleasant lows on the way but hey its a learning process right My situation shortly The 3rd world country where I live in has only one company for medical apparatus related to diabetes MedTronic I am trialing their insulin pump 630G for about a week now and the thing is amazing Every time I get to sit down for a meal and have to push a few buttons instead of injecting insulin manually I feel very happy Nothing bad to say about the pump However the constant blood glucose monitor from MedTronic believe its called Guardian Connect the one that works with the 630G anyway is a little bit less impressive I like the suspend on low feature a lot just wish the monitor was a bit more accurate MedTronic rep suggested I look into getting the newer 670G from my home country about 10 hours flight away I visit once or twice annually as its a newer model and might be cheaper there the country where I live in taxes diabetes apparatus highly From what I understood there is also a better CGM from MedTronic out there using a newer sensor Guardian 3 the one Im using with the 630G is the older model from I understood Wouldnt mind making the switch to that if its better than the Guardian Connect 630G combo ANYWAYS A few things I was hoping I could get answers to 1 Is it convenient to buy the newer version of the pump 670G from my home country and use it where I live about 10 000 kms away How often are you guys needing replacements for the pump how often do they break down etc I do have support from MedTronic in the country where I live in now as in spare parts etc but if I needed a new pump in case the old 670G breaks down that would take time I assume 2 weeks or so MedTronic said they can give me a replacement pump if that happens would be a 630G I assume and that they can find a way to send the general spare parts needed for the pump and monitor sensors etc to the country where I live in so that shouldnt be an issue 2 How much of an improvement is the Guardian 3 sensor from the CGM sensor that works together with the 630G How much of an improvement is the 670G from the 630G I read that 670G should be more automated and can increase basal if sugars look high which I like Ive read some mixed reviews on reddit about the 670G though 3 Is it silly to buy a pump that has no support in the country I live in For example my home country has Omnipod for sale but the country where I live in has 0 support for it so Id have to fly 10 000 kilometres every time I want a new pump or more spare parts Guess that doesnt work out I wouldnt want to fly the distance more often than once every 6 months 4 How about using the 630G or 670G for pump but another CGM such as DexCom G6 How much am I missing out by not having the pump and the CGM work together as in how much am I missing out by not having the system adjust basal automatically Im not entirely sure if I can even buy a DexCom since in my home country Finland Omnipod and DexCom dont sell products to private patients directly and Im not entitled to healthcare in Finland anymor since Im not a resident So Im not sure if a doctor would even treat me assign the CGM for me even if I pay for it fully But I could look into it DexCom has no operations or support in the country I live in fwiw Insurance is not a consideration it will not pay anything for me in neither country So I will pay for all costs for pump and CGM and spare parts Money is not an issue I just want the best machines the best combination of a pump CGM I can get that is convenient for me Ive been talking with the MedTronic reps about the logistics of pulling this thing off but I dont expect to get non biased opinions from them would be good to hear what reddit thinks I think Im getting the hang of this diabetes thing pretty well just a few things I could use help with Thanks a lot in advance for replies</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just want to share my story because i feel like i can't share it with someone irl who understands. I got diagnosed diabetes type 1 in 2013 when i was 22. At first it was a shock and this shock made me change some of my habits. I read about alternative treatments such as changing your diet. I went vegan, ate mostly vegetables and raw, i ate about 100-150g carbs a day. My bloodsugar level was pretty good for a while and i was really confident. I survived with no insulin for a while until suddenly from one to the other day my blood sugar level didn't go down how it did before. So i started to take insulin again. Because my bsl was good i started to eat more carbs and i needed to take more insulin. \\n\\nIn 2015 i left to travel asia/europe with my ex-girlfriend. At that time i was used to take insulin before every meal and take the basis insulin daily. Confronted with strangers almost every day, getting invited for lunch/dinner etc. or just having a drink made me to be not so so consequent with taking the insulin. At first i thought it's ok and it was ok for a while. But it wasn't. I didn't want to explain myself everytime when i have lunch or dinner with someone new. I didn't accept the fact that i have diabetes and that i'm bound to chemicals for the rest of my life, i realised that only later. And i'm still not sure if i accepted it 100%. Everytime i did something 'bad' for my diabetes i thought 'no worries, you gonna change these habbits sooner or later'. \\n\\nIt's strange, diabetes, it's always here but you never really see it, it's like a ghost, you know there is something but only numbers tell you it's real. I was travelling for about one and a half year. The last 7/6 months i travelled alone, and more than once i rewarded my self with sweets (which i would never ate before diabetes) because i thought now that i'm alone and nobody sees it it doesn't count. But it did. When i arrived back home my first week i spent in the hospital because of a Ketoacidosis. That was in fall 2017. Then i thought ok now i have to change. \\n\\nI did for a while. But then 2018 came, summer came and i got accepted for art school. I was checking my hba1c regularly and it was never really good (around 10/11). I kept telling me i will change my habits and start to have a healthier life style soon. I dont't talk about my bad levels with other people because i feel it will disconnect me from society, or from social activities. \\n\\nI'm a student now, i sit a lot. I go out a lot, drink a lot (mostly beer). There are less days in the week where i don't drink. I take drugs at parties and come home early in the mornings or afternoons. I don't have regular meal times, sometimes i eat after midnight when i come home, sometimes i eat almost nothing the whole day, sometimes i'm just snacking. My blood sugar levels are a mess and i need a lot of insulin. I don't count carbs or anything, i just inject what i think is necessary. Mostly i'm wrong. I haven't been to the doctor to check my hba1c lately cause i moved city. Most people from my surroundings tend to drink a lot (art students) and i think alcohol is more or less a big problem in having diabetes under control. When i'm drunk i care less. I was thinking about quitting alcohol but change to other substances like lsd (micro dosing or so). I don't know if it would be a good idea. \\n\\nIt's pretty clear what i should change. But it's not easy. It makes me sad, makes me feeling helpless and i still pretend everything is fine. Since a few months i have a small round spot in my sight. It's getting a little bigger lately. I'm observing it. I don't want to get blind. It creeps me out. I only talked to one of my friends about it. I don't want to be the 'special case', i just want to enjoy life like everyone else is doing around me. But i can't. I pretend i do enjoy but everytime i consume something, food, drinks etc. i feel guilty. It's a feeling which came with the diagnosis of type 1.. \\n\\ni don't know what i expect on sharing this here but maybe it feels good to write it. sorry for my english, it's not my native tongue.</td>\n",

       "      <td>my type 1 storyJust want to share my story because i feel like i can t share it with someone irl who understands I got diagnosed diabetes type 1 in 2013 when i was 22 At first it was a shock and this shock made me change some of my habits I read about alternative treatments such as changing your diet I went vegan ate mostly vegetables and raw i ate about 100 150g carbs a day My bloodsugar level was pretty good for a while and i was really confident I survived with no insulin for a while until suddenly from one to the other day my blood sugar level didn t go down how it did before So i started to take insulin again Because my bsl was good i started to eat more carbs and i needed to take more insulin In 2015 i left to travel asia europe with my ex girlfriend At that time i was used to take insulin before every meal and take the basis insulin daily Confronted with strangers almost every day getting invited for lunch dinner etc or just having a drink made me to be not so so consequent with taking the insulin At first i thought it s ok and it was ok for a while But it wasn t I didn t want to explain myself everytime when i have lunch or dinner with someone new I didn t accept the fact that i have diabetes and that i m bound to chemicals for the rest of my life i realised that only later And i m still not sure if i accepted it 100 Everytime i did something bad for my diabetes i thought no worries you gonna change these habbits sooner or later It s strange diabetes it s always here but you never really see it it s like a ghost you know there is something but only numbers tell you it s real I was travelling for about one and a half year The last 7 6 months i travelled alone and more than once i rewarded my self with sweets which i would never ate before diabetes because i thought now that i m alone and nobody sees it it doesn t count But it did When i arrived back home my first week i spent in the hospital because of a Ketoacidosis That was in fall 2017 Then i thought ok now i have to change I did for a while But then 2018 came summer came and i got accepted for art school I was checking my hba1c regularly and it was never really good around 10 11 I kept telling me i will change my habits and start to have a healthier life style soon I dont t talk about my bad levels with other people because i feel it will disconnect me from society or from social activities I m a student now i sit a lot I go out a lot drink a lot mostly beer There are less days in the week where i don t drink I take drugs at parties and come home early in the mornings or afternoons I don t have regular meal times sometimes i eat after midnight when i come home sometimes i eat almost nothing the whole day sometimes i m just snacking My blood sugar levels are a mess and i need a lot of insulin I don t count carbs or anything i just inject what i think is necessary Mostly i m wrong I haven t been to the doctor to check my hba1c lately cause i moved city Most people from my surroundings tend to drink a lot art students and i think alcohol is more or less a big problem in having diabetes under control When i m drunk i care less I was thinking about quitting alcohol but change to other substances like lsd micro dosing or so I don t know if it would be a good idea It s pretty clear what i should change But it s not easy It makes me sad makes me feeling helpless and i still pretend everything is fine Since a few months i have a small round spot in my sight It s getting a little bigger lately I m observing it I don t want to get blind It creeps me out I only talked to one of my friends about it I don t want to be the special case i just want to enjoy life like everyone else is doing around me But i can t I pretend i do enjoy but everytime i consume something food drinks etc i feel guilty It s a feeling which came with the diagnosis of type 1 i don t know what i expect on sharing this here but maybe it feels good to write it sorry for my english it s not my native tongue</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey guys, I’ve been debating making this post for a few weeks now. This is a throwaway account since my SO might also be subscribed and I just want advice on how I could address this before I work up the courage to talk to them.    I don’t want to worry them by being a worrywart myself and hovering. They’ve been so pleasantly surprised every time they’ve caught me educating myself on type 1. I bought a book not long after we started dating and they ‘caught’ me taking notes; they were scrolling through my reddit (I had no problem with this) recently and were surprised to see I was subscribed to r/diabetes. I love them very much and want to do what I can to support them, to encourage a healthy diet and active-enough lifestyle, to cheer them on, to know what to do if they’re ever in need of medical attention.    I’m beginning to secretly *really* worry they may be in a slump as far as keeping their blood sugar below the “high” threshold they’ve got on their pump. Circumstances involving their future career have seemed to have gotten them very down, and they tend to keep everything that’s bothering them just bottled up until they’re ready to burst. I’m afraid to pry because of my own insecurities, worried (irrationally) that I’ll have gone too far and prodded too much and just drive them away. Also I’m worried that my worrying will just make them feel even worse. I’m scared I’m too nosey about it. But I perk up instantly when their pump vibrates that their BG is too high. And I feel ashamed but I peek when they pull it out to bolus, and I keep seeing it in the 300s (mg/dL). I’m so worried. I know it’s not as bad as being too low but it’s still bad, and I don’t know how to address it. They were diagnosed over two years ago and it pains me to have educated myself on all of this and still be tentative about *knowing what exactly* is going on.    Don’t you feel physically terrible when your BG is higher than 200? They seem ok; they’re not doing jumping jacks obviously but they don’t let it stop them from spending time with me and being happy. They’ve gained some weight in recent months, and I’ve chalked it up to stress and to them just trying to keep up with me and be “normal.” They love their fast food and their candy, they get excited to share and binge with me. And as much as I enjoy eating junk food (and for the most part can get away with it, with my metabolism being what it is and my job being rather physically strenuous) I *really* want to have better habits so that we can get into a groove together. I’ve been gently shot down the few times I’ve suggested it, and like I said before: my insecurities about overstepping boundaries keep me from just bringing it up. I’ve tentatively asked how their blood sugar has been, hoping they know I mean how they’ve been doing and how it’s been going because they do seem to be very alone in that regard. I’m not aware of their receiving any support online and they don’t see their endo very often. But when I’ve tried to casually bring up their BG, they’ve answered so shortly and carelessly that I’ve worried I’ve annoyed them by being nosey. I’ve resigned to just not bringing it up at all now, and I cringe internally when I see them gorge on candies and not pull out their pump once.    Here in the last week they’ve started kind of ignoring me when I wake them when their pump buzzes too. I know they’re sleepy and maybe I just don’t fully wake them, but my silly insecurities get the best of me yet again and I’m afraid they’re getting very tired of me insisting they check their pump and bolus in the middle of the night when it’s woken me up. I’m never annoyed by it by any means. Like I’ve said countless times...I just worry.    What would you do, if your SO expressed worry about your levels? Do you talk about it openly? I’ve even showed them funny t1d memes and I’ve gotten mixed reactions that have made me so sad... I just want to make it normal, because it’s a part of their life and it’s never going away, and it sucks and I just want to be here for them. But I’m so uncertain.    Thanks for any input, sorry this is so long and especially sorry if this isn’t really appropriate. I just want to understand and to show them their wellbeing means a lot to me.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Advice for someone dating a t1 diabetic Hey guys I ve been debating making this post for a few weeks now This is a throwaway account since my SO might also be subscribed and I just want advice on how I could address this before I work up the courage to talk to them I don t want to worry them by being a worrywart myself and hovering They ve been so pleasantly surprised every time they ve caught me educating myself on type 1 I bought a book not long after we started dating and they caught me taking notes they were scrolling through my reddit I had no problem with this recently and were surprised to see I was subscribed to r diabetes I love them very much and want to do what I can to support them to encourage a healthy diet and active enough lifestyle to cheer them on to know what to do if they re ever in need of medical attention I m beginning to secretly really worry they may be in a slump as far as keeping their blood sugar below the high threshold they ve got on their pump Circumstances involving their future career have seemed to have gotten them very down and they tend to keep everything that s bothering them just bottled up until they re ready to burst I m afraid to pry because of my own insecurities worried irrationally that I ll have gone too far and prodded too much and just drive them away Also I m worried that my worrying will just make them feel even worse I m scared I m too nosey about it But I perk up instantly when their pump vibrates that their BG is too high And I feel ashamed but I peek when they pull it out to bolus and I keep seeing it in the 300s mg dL I m so worried I know it s not as bad as being too low but it s still bad and I don t know how to address it They were diagnosed over two years ago and it pains me to have educated myself on all of this and still be tentative about knowing what exactly is going on Don t you feel physically terrible when your BG is higher than 200 They seem ok they re not doing jumping jacks obviously but they don t let it stop them from spending time with me and being happy They ve gained some weight in recent months and I ve chalked it up to stress and to them just trying to keep up with me and be normal They love their fast food and their candy they get excited to share and binge with me And as much as I enjoy eating junk food and for the most part can get away with it with my metabolism being what it is and my job being rather physically strenuous I really want to have better habits so that we can get into a groove together I ve been gently shot down the few times I ve suggested it and like I said before my insecurities about overstepping boundaries keep me from just bringing it up I ve tentatively asked how their blood sugar has been hoping they know I mean how they ve been doing and how it s been going because they do seem to be very alone in that regard I m not aware of their receiving any support online and they don t see their endo very often But when I ve tried to casually bring up their BG they ve answered so shortly and carelessly that I ve worried I ve annoyed them by being nosey I ve resigned to just not bringing it up at all now and I cringe internally when I see them gorge on candies and not pull out their pump once Here in the last week they ve started kind of ignoring me when I wake them when their pump buzzes too I know they re sleepy and maybe I just don t fully wake them but my silly insecurities get the best of me yet again and I m afraid they re getting very tired of me insisting they check their pump and bolus in the middle of the night when it s woken me up I m never annoyed by it by any means Like I ve said countless times I just worry What would you do if your SO expressed worry about your levels Do you talk about it openly I ve even showed them funny t1d memes and I ve gotten mixed reactions that have made me so sad I just want to make it normal because it s a part of their life and it s never going away and it sucks and I just want to be here for them But I m so uncertain Thanks for any input sorry this is so long and especially sorry if this isn t really appropriate I just want to understand and to show them their wellbeing means a lot to me</td>\n",

       "      <td>I wanted to share this story because it just happened today and I don’t know if any type 1s have experienced this. \\n\\nI work at a small-town hardware store and we get a lot of elderly people who come in. I got to work around 11 after going to my endo appointment. I was watching the register while another coworker was at lunch, and we were pretty slow during this time so there were maybe three people in the store. I rang an older couple out, they took their things and walked out. Once they left, an older gentleman walked by the register and was sort of grunting and walking a bit funny. I kept my eye on him as he left but once he reached the door I had another customer come up to the counter. I start ringing them out and the couple that I had checked out a minute ago come back in and tell me the gentleman had collapsed in the parking lot. I paged for another coworker to come up front and help me out, so we both go outside and see this guy on his back, kind of rolling around. I took my sweatshirt off and put it under his head. We try asking a couple questions but he isn’t responding so I called 911. I didn’t see any bleeding but he looked very pale- a familiar kind of pale. I had a feeling in my gut he was diabetic, but when I asked he didn’t respond. Where I live, the fire department is literally across the street from the store. I stayed on the phone with dispatch for a while as she asked me questions, and finally hung up once she told me they were on the way. We wait another 3 minutes or so until they arrive. Once they get there they start asking questions, and one question they asked was if he was a diabetic, to which he said finally said yes. They check his sugar and it was at 21. Once they said that my jaw dropped and I froze. They got him up on the gurney and took him into the ambulance. Once my coworker and I went inside I immediately started crying uncontrollably and headed for the bathroom. I felt like I was looking at my future and it was terrifying. I tried to pull myself together but I had to leave work for the day because I was so distraught. I’ve never witnessed another diabetic so critically low before. They asked him if he gave himself insulin and he said yes, and then they asked if he ate anything and he said he didn’t know. It made me think about growing old and being in situations like this. I could have my diabetes under control but you can’t fight old age and it really scared me. My coworker texted me and told me the gentleman was okay, and that he drove home after about 30-45 minutes in the ambulance. I just needed to get this off my chest because it’s been bothering me all day and I didn’t know if anyone else has had experiences like this. It was just overwhelming and hit me hard.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just a piece of background info: Along with T1D I also have ankylosing spondylitis and am on Humira, an immunosuppressant for it which makes me more susceptible to infections, I’ve had about two a year since I started it.\\n\\nSo I changed my pump (omnipod) on Sunday/Monday and it was kind of irritated, not unusual, it was in for the whole three days when my doc has me prescribed for two because my body tends to reject them early. Few days later it’s more irritated and showing some signs of infection. Wednesday it was even worse so I went to urgent care. They said they were glad I came in when I did, lanced it to add a gauze to help drain it and got me an rx for antibiotics. \\n\\nThe next day it was worse and I was dizzy and nauseas, went back to urgent care who then sent me to the ER because they were worried about sepsis at this point. I contacted my rheumatologist to clarify I should cease taking my immunosuppressant and ask how I should handle it. She got back to me with instructions, she has always allowed me to be a participant in my own care and has trusted my judgement when my care would also affect my diabetes.\\n\\nAt the hospital, all is good in the ER, no one concerned about my pump although I had to explain, the infusion site became infected after I removed it and that my pump was not still at the infection site. \\n\\nOnce I was admitted I had to repeatedly clarify to the nurse what an insulin pump does vs a cgm. This continued the entire time. I also had to spell Ankylosing Spondylitis for her multiple times and clarify that just putting spondylosis as the diagnosis was not sufficient because AS is autoimmune and general spondylosis doesn’t automatically mean that. \\n\\nLuckily they let me keep my insulin pump and just keep a log (that nobody looked at because none of the nurses understood diabetes or insulin pumps) but, again, I had to clarify multiple times that no, my pump was not still at the infection site. I made it clear there was nothing wrong with my pump, my infusion sites, ect. And this was an issue because I am immunosuppressed. \\n\\nWhen I saw the doc he kind of questioned me more than necessary on my AS diagnosis because I’m a girl, more men are diagnosed with AS, and because my diagnosis wasn’t confirmed by radiology or gene testing. Kind of annoying, but I am used to my diabetes being the scapegoat of all my problems so I was just happy he was focusing on the disease that actually caused the issue and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just interested.\\n\\nYesterday, while waiting 7 hours to be discharged they sent in a diabetes educator, without informing me beforehand. She woke me up and started grilling me. She was trying to make this an issue about how I manage my insulin pump. She tried to insist there was some problem with how I use my pump to explain the infection, trying to suggest things like I need to use skin tac wipes, which I have had reactions to. She didn’t ask me what I thought happened or how I manage my pump. I have been on a pump for 12 years. I just felt blindsided, I just reaffirmed there were no issues with my pump and that it was my immunosuppressant and I’ve already been in contact with my rheum.\\n\\nI will say I’m lucky that my endo is also type one so he has always understood and has always respected the fact that I am the expert on my own individual experience with diabetes.  It’s just annoying when you have people who know very little trying to lecture you because you’re in the hospital for a tangently related issue.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Was in the hospital for an infection from my infusion site because I am immunosuppressed to treat my ankylosing spondylitis, nurses didn’t know the difference between a pump and a cgm and they surprised me with a diabetes educator trying to blame my pump management for the infection.</td>\n",

       "      <td>At first sorry for my english. I am from Austria and I do my best. I am also on my phone so sorry about the formatting.\\n\\nA few things about me: I am 19 years old and I suffer from diabetes t1 for 15 years. I have a pump since I was 10 I guess. At fist I had a medtronic pump but I  got a ypsomed pump last year bc it's not that big and you can connect it to your phone and other benefits. I use a steel catheter since the plastic ones always bend (???) hence I always had a leaking catheter and my bloodsugar was high. But the steel ones are great, I don't feel them in my body and my blood sugar is great since then.\\n\\nNow about the little fuck up. Last Friday I was in Vienna and got really hungry so I ordered fast food and ate it. Me being a dumb, lazy idiot, I forgot to inject the insulin. So after an hour I felt that my blood sugar was high and I corrected my mistake. After half an hour I felt it was still pretty high (don't worry I also checked my blood sugar level) and I injected another dosis of insulin. But nothing changed. I thought it was normal since I ate a lot and normally my body needs to \"calm down\" after being on a high glucose level. Later me and my gf decided to go and get some food so I drove to the mall and bevor I went into the restaurant I checked my blood sugar which is still high af. I know I should have considered it before but now was the time I had to change the catheter. I was angry bc I rarely need that long to get a decent glucose level. I put a new catheter in  and removed the old one.\\nI almost got a heart attack bc the plastic on the catheter was fine but the 9 mm needle wasn't attached to the plastic anymore. I pressed on the part of my body where the catheter originally was and I felt an unpleasant pain. I still had no panic since my gf was next to me but if she wasn't here I would have screamed and cried bc I was so scared. So I drove to the hospital and they tried to pull this 9 mm thing out of my body. They cut a piece of my skin out, searched for it and finally after 20 minutes they managed to show me the needle.\\n\\nNow I am sitting here, one week later with a healing scar and praying that I never ever have to experience this shit  again. I guess it was a production problem but it still scares me to think about that this could happen again.\\n\\nAgain sorry for my English I just wanted to tell you about this situation and I can't give you any advice. Just take care of yourself and check your catheters.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It was suggested of me to cross post this here. I originally posted it in the bjj forum since I'm a grappler and type 1 since the age of 6 years old, and I'm currently turning 38 this weekend. Going to pasta my post now -\\n\\nIn threads in the past I have had conversations with members about CGMs and how the pump, etc was not an option for me as I cant keep a sensor or port in to save my life. They always pulled out, no matter how well I wrapped and taped them to my body, so I gave up and did it the old fashioned way. Finger sticks and shots. \\n\\nLast week I got the Eversense CGM implant and it is the real deal. They implant a sensor, in the form of a capsule/chip under the skin and then place the transmittor on the skin which sends the readings to an app on my phone. Best part is that I can slap a new adhesive on after training everyday and it wont break the bank the way a traditional CGM would as insurance only covers one sensor per week. They give 100 adhesive patches per 3 month period and buying more patches isnt very costly at all.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis is seriously one of the best things to happen for active diabetics, especially those of us who grapple. I have been training for many years, and this has been a godsend for me. When I train, I take the transmitter off, when I'm done training, I put it right back on. Easy as that for a cgm. I don't have to worry about covering anything when training or fear people grabbing it when they grab my gi etc\\n\\nI know Im leaving some detailed shit out but go research it and see if your insurance will cover it.\\n\\nThe insurance plan I have through my wife covers the sensor, however I am in a different state at the time so my the had to contract with a local BCBS plan that unfortunately, doesnt cover the system. Luckily the Eversense has a bridge program that cuts the costs down TREMENDOUSLY to only about $99 for a three month insertion, and you get three insertions for a total of $300 for 9 months of CGM. During that time they can try to help you get it covered and theyll work your insurance I believe.\\n\\nA plus is that one of the reps has trained BJJ, so they understand what its like to deal with this shit. Customer service has been great with them and they are calling to check up on me daily to answer any questions or to see if Im having any issues. \\n\\n Im not getting paid, nor do I work for or affiliate with the company, but as I said this is a big deal for me and my care. Hopefully it can help someone else out who is in the same place I have been in for the past 12+ years when it comes to bjj and grappling.\\n\\nIve been type 1 since I was about 6 years old, I normally test between 6-12x per day, and today I only poked my fingers 2x for the daily calibration.\\n\\nhttps://www.eversensediabetes.com/patient-education/\\n\\nAccessories-\\n\\ngrifgrips.com  diastuff.de</td>\n",

       "      <td>Game changer for the very active type 1It was suggested of me to cross post this here I originally posted it in the bjj forum since I m a grappler and type 1 since the age of 6 years old and I m currently turning 38 this weekend Going to pasta my post now In threads in the past I have had conversations with members about CGMs and how the pump etc was not an option for me as I cant keep a sensor or port in to save my life They always pulled out no matter how well I wrapped and taped them to my body so I gave up and did it the old fashioned way Finger sticks and shots Last week I got the Eversense CGM implant and it is the real deal They implant a sensor in the form of a capsule chip under the skin and then place the transmittor on the skin which sends the readings to an app on my phone Best part is that I can slap a new adhesive on after training everyday and it wont break the bank the way a traditional CGM would as insurance only covers one sensor per week They give 100 adhesive patches per 3 month period and buying more patches isnt very costly at all This is seriously one of the best things to happen for active diabetics especially those of us who grapple I have been training for many years and this has been a godsend for me When I train I take the transmitter off when I m done training I put it right back on Easy as that for a cgm I don t have to worry about covering anything when training or fear people grabbing it when they grab my gi etc I know Im leaving some detailed shit out but go research it and see if your insurance will cover it The insurance plan I have through my wife covers the sensor however I am in a different state at the time so my the had to contract with a local BCBS plan that unfortunately doesnt cover the system Luckily the Eversense has a bridge program that cuts the costs down TREMENDOUSLY to only about 99 for a three month insertion and you get three insertions for a total of 300 for 9 months of CGM During that time they can try to help you get it covered and theyll work your insurance I believe A plus is that one of the reps has trained BJJ so they understand what its like to deal with this shit Customer service has been great with them and they are calling to check up on me daily to answer any questions or to see if Im having any issues Im not getting paid nor do I work for or affiliate with the company but as I said this is a big deal for me and my care Hopefully it can help someone else out who is in the same place I have been in for the past 12 years when it comes to bjj and grappling Ive been type 1 since I was about 6 years old I normally test between 6 12x per day and today I only poked my fingers 2x for the daily calibration https www eversensediabetes com patient education Accessories grifgrips com diastuff de</td>\n",

       "      <td>Am I alone in feeling like I am being held hostage by the doctors? I don’t need to see a doctor. Nothing is wrong. Nothing has changed. They are going to say the exact same things they have always said. Even the A1c is going to come back the same or extremely similar. But they won’t renew my rx unless they get their $70 co-pay every month. Seriously. If feels like my life in exchange for my money. I am being held hostage at syringe point. \\n\\nIf it was a random person on the street threatening to choke me to death and deny me the air I need to breathe in exchange for money I would be screaming for police and justice. But it’s a doctor and this is a medical condition so it must be ok for them to do this right?\\n\\nBut I don’t want a doctor controlling my life for the rest of my life. I don’t want doctors telling me to get more exercise, drink more water, control my stress levels, get more sleep, and otherwise just be god damn well perfect all the fucking time. Test more. Eat less carbs. Yak yak yak the fucking know it all, perfect life, no stress, fucking doctors who apparently forget I don’t live in a vacuum and life happens no matter what. And it ends no matter what. I try. I do my best. \\n\\nBut my toddler has no idea why mommy suddenly gets angry and has to stop and eat and can’t play for the next hour while I try to recover and stabilize. So I’ve had my targets a bit higher than normal so I don’t scream at my toddler to leave me alone so I can focus on finding the skittles and not having a seizure and finding the phone to call someone in case I suddenly need an ambulance. And that I am trading my long term health so my toddler doesn’t need therapy for the rest of her life bc mommy seems to be totally bipolar. And instead of listening to me, and trying to help, I’m told to do better and balance my activity and food and stress better. Bc that’s really helpful. \\n\\nI just need someone to tell me that it is ok. That I am not a shitty mom. That my toddler is going to survive my lows and it’s going to be worth it to keep putting up with this diabetic shit day in and day out for the rest of my life. \\n\\nI’m just having a super shitty day and need some support. Bc when your toddler hugs you while you have an anxiety attack saying ‘mommy feel better’... ladies and gents I feel like shit right now. It was the sweetest thing ever. And all I want to do is go crawl in a hole and cry so she doesn’t see me crying and doesn’t see how sad mommy gets bc of this diabetic shit. And my little girl shouldn’t have to be careful where she touches me bc of my pump and infusion site.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been having problems with Omnipod for several months. It's so bad that I'm trying to switch to T:Slim.\\n\\nBut I have been able to improve things and I want to explain how I do it just in case it helps some one else.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, use an area that has lots of fat.\\n\\nSecond, look for veins. They appear blue/green and you must keep the infusion catheter from hitting them.\\n\\nThird, rotate your locations as much as possible. For me there are only two places I can wear a pod successfully: my left and right abdominal fat roll. Anywhere else ends in tears / high blood sugar.\\n\\nDo not overfill the Omnipod. No more than 200 Units, even though it can take a bit more.\\n\\nIf possible, allow the insulin to warm to room temperature before filling it. If I have to do an emergency change, I warm the insulin bottle with both hands.\\n\\nDo not take off the cap until after priming is done.\\n\\nGently flick the insulin in the \"insertion window\" out of the pod after priming and removing the cap.\\n\\nPeel one of the bottom stickers part way, then pull the other sticker off the whole way, then pull the first off the rest of the way.\\n\\nPlace the pod on the body. Avoid getting too close to the belly button.\\n\\nTake a picture, or closely examine the \"injection window.\" Note the inner shape of the plastic and how much insulin is stuck to it.\\n\\nWith one hand pinch the roll of fat under the pod as deep as possible. The goal is to bring up the pod without causing tension on the skin it is attached to. In other words, bring up the skin, but don't pinch it.\\n\\nWith the other hand start the pod and then immediately press down on the pod so that is is pushed gently into the skin. I try to make the skin look flat instead of bubbled at the top.\\n\\nThere is a random amount of time after you hear the pump clicking before you hear the snap of the cannula being inserted.\\n\\nNote the amount of pain you felt. Pain is not necessarily a bad thing, but can sometimes indicate that you struck a vein.\\n\\nLook at the top of the pod and make sure the little thin area window shows pink. (I've never had that fail).\\n\\nLook at or take a picture of the insertion window and make sure the cannula is properly entering your skin.\\n\\nTake your first bolus. I always change out before breakfast so I take around 10  units with my cereal.\\n\\nAfter the pump is done clicking, take another picture of your insertion window and note if the shape of the liquid in the plastic has changed, if there are more or less bubbles of insulin, or literally any change at all. If anything is significantly different, the insulin may not be going into you.\\n\\nAlso, have someone who cares give it the sniff test. The amount of insulin will be very little and the amount of smell associated with a well installed pod will be learnable. Your family / friends will be able to tell you if the smell is too strong because the insulin is leaking under the pod into the adhesive.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Suggestion for attaching OmnipodsI ve been having problems with Omnipod for several months It s so bad that I m trying to switch to T Slim But I have been able to improve things and I want to explain how I do it just in case it helps some one else First and foremost use an area that has lots of fat Second look for veins They appear blue green and you must keep the infusion catheter from hitting them Third rotate your locations as much as possible For me there are only two places I can wear a pod successfully my left and right abdominal fat roll Anywhere else ends in tears high blood sugar Do not overfill the Omnipod No more than 200 Units even though it can take a bit more If possible allow the insulin to warm to room temperature before filling it If I have to do an emergency change I warm the insulin bottle with both hands Do not take off the cap until after priming is done Gently flick the insulin in the insertion window out of the pod after priming and removing the cap Peel one of the bottom stickers part way then pull the other sticker off the whole way then pull the first off the rest of the way Place the pod on the body Avoid getting too close to the belly button Take a picture or closely examine the injection window Note the inner shape of the plastic and how much insulin is stuck to it With one hand pinch the roll of fat under the pod as deep as possible The goal is to bring up the pod without causing tension on the skin it is attached to In other words bring up the skin but don t pinch it With the other hand start the pod and then immediately press down on the pod so that is is pushed gently into the skin I try to make the skin look flat instead of bubbled at the top There is a random amount of time after you hear the pump clicking before you hear the snap of the cannula being inserted Note the amount of pain you felt Pain is not necessarily a bad thing but can sometimes indicate that you struck a vein Look at the top of the pod and make sure the little thin area window shows pink I ve never had that fail Look at or take a picture of the insertion window and make sure the cannula is properly entering your skin Take your first bolus I always change out before breakfast so I take around 10 units with my cereal After the pump is done clicking take another picture of your insertion window and note if the shape of the liquid in the plastic has changed if there are more or less bubbles of insulin or literally any change at all If anything is significantly different the insulin may not be going into you Also have someone who cares give it the sniff test The amount of insulin will be very little and the amount of smell associated with a well installed pod will be learnable Your family friends will be able to tell you if the smell is too strong because the insulin is leaking under the pod into the adhesive</td>\n",

       "      <td>thanks to the continual improvement of technology and the growth of knowledge via research I have been able to evade natural selection. having been diagnosed 37 years ago I have been through many stages of engagement in my own health. acceptance, resistance, denial, success, failure. I have seen many technologies come and go and I have relied on the grace of other who care for me, I have benefitted from the intellect and dedication of scientists, doctors, and educators. Diabetes was once a death sentence, thankfully that is no longer the case. this time in history is the best time to be a diabetic, CGMs, pumps, different types of insulin all make our lives easier and our control tighter and less stressful. I try hard to be grateful for the good thing surrounding this genetic hand I've been dealt. for a long time I lived as if tomorrow was uncertain, and in a large part I still feel that way, but I approach the ramifications of that idea differently. in my 20's this idea of cheating death made me feel fragile so I engaged in risky behavior, made bad decisions, and turned my back not he hard work others had done for  and with me to keep me alive. I have regrets about those bad decisions because they have boomeranged back to me, affecting my eyesight and feet. I can't take those choices back and I won't live with regret about them. I will confront the consequences and move forward. I have never ask for sympathy and I don't find it productive. I don't get angry when someone who doesn't know about my disease makes a comment about sugar, tells me \"you can't eat that\", or doesn't know that their grandma's type II is far different than my type I. In a moment like that I try to educate and grow awareness. I don't understand why there is a comorbidity of diabetes and depression but I live it, I feel it, I battle it every day. this is a heavy weight we all have to bear. I carry guilt for fighting my mother when she tried to deliver an injection to me at 6 years old, I feel angry at myself for keeping my wife up at night when I have an urgent low. but I also feel a sense of pride that I wake up everyday, that even though I have, in the past chosen not to fight, I wake up and face this disease head on. I have grown. I fight and I try and I do what I have to to stay alive. it's not easy for me right now and I want to say to all of my fellow type I soldiers, you can do this. you can fight another day. it's gonna hurt, you are going to cry, you are going to over bolus, over eat, forget to test, ignore your beeping CGM, but you're also gonna see a better A1C, your gonna eat an awesome meal that doesn't send you running for the keto sticks. I don't know what the hell I just wrote but as much as I am trying to convince you its gonna be ok I am trying twice as hard to convince myself.  I am currently searching for a reason to feel grateful to be upright today. we are beating natural selection and thats weird because it makes me feel proud and it also makes me feel like I don't really belong on this side of the dirt...</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I was diagnosed February 2018 and I just wanted a place to share how I got diagnosed.\\n\\n\\nSo their were no signs at first we had no idea that I was diabetic so when I started getting symptoms we had all assumed that it was the flu I was throwing up everything that I ate and I felt sick all the time focusing was impossible I didn't even want to watch YouTube or read.\\n\\nWe were really confused because my temp wasn't high or anything but it was obvious that I was doing had so I stayed home and slept all day barely eating anything cause throwing up isn't fun and since we didn't know what was wrong they were giving me sprite smoothies and ice cream to help (it didn't).\\n\\nWe went to Care now and they also thought it was the flu so we were just told to wait it out and given advice then I started always drinking water I had quite a bit before but now I was always thirsty and I always had to piss which sucked cause I didn't want to move I remember waking up in the middle of the night trying to drink from my 36oz cup of water and literally just crying if I didn't have any cause I felt like shit and didn't want to go down the stairs\\n\\nThis continued for 1-2 weeks and I wasn't improving and my parents were worried cause I hadn't gotten sick in 6-7 years before this (idk good genes?) But other than being thirsty and pissing a lot throwing up wasn't to crazy for the flu and not wanting to eat (I starved myself those weeks and ate almost nothing I was getting THIN) so they didn't take me to a hospital or anything.\\n\\nAnd then I started hallucinating and my mom said NOPE I was so bad that I was legit seeing things and didn't even know we were at our house (kept saying I wanted to go home (scared the shit out of my grandmother who's a nurse and hears that from dying patients)) my mom literally drags me from my room cause I insist that I'm fine and just want to lay down and drives me up to Care now where they (I assume) check my blood sugar  (around 500-600 cause I hadn't been eating and I was still pumping out a bit of insulin) and next thing I know I'm in an ambulance where I sleep cause I don't want to exist deal with anything (headache hungry tired thirsty) \\n\\n\\nThen I'm in the hospital and I don't remember why but I wasn't aloud to eat for 24 hours (was at cook children's btw great people 10/10 never wanna go again) didn't even give me water (I hated it) just ice chips I was hungry from starving myself pissed cause the other patients never shut up so I could sleep the bed was uncomfortable cause I didn't have my own room and I hadn't eaten for 1-2 weeks \\n\\nThings did get better though and after the 24 hours I got my first meal that I didn't throw up in 2 weeks scrambled eggs sausage (ordered bacon But they didn't gimme t-t) milk and fruit loops.\\n\\nI did hallucinate a bit more in the hospital some a bit more obvious than the others in order I SAW a spider hanging from the ceiling that scared the shit out of me when I thought that it disappeared cause it fell in my covers, a light show like multiple cat lasers of different colors with the beam visible and water dripping from the ceiling like rain.\\n\\nTDLR: got diabetes thought it was the flu very wrong</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ve had type 1 for 14 years this spring and can say confidently its had its fair share of ups and downs. When I was first diagnosed at 9 years old, I seemed to accept it with little to no trouble and adjusted to the lifestyle fairly quickly. Sure, it was tough, especially as a kid, but I always tried my best to remain positive and figured if i was to have a chronic disease I’d prefer it to be something like type 1 diabetes and not something more fatal. I’ve also always struggled with depression and ADHD, which as you can assume took quite the toll on my diabetes management and overall mental health. Despite struggling with depression and ADHD, I was always on top of my diabetes management trough grade school and high school (which I largely attribute to my mom’s help and guidance). However, once I went to college it all changed. I moved across the country and was on my own for the first time in my life, surrounded by completely new people in a state I had never even visited before and consequently, my lifestyle completely changes as well. With the pressure from school, drinking and horrible eating habits, my diabetes management quickly fell by the wayside. \\n\\nI began checking less and less frequently and started taking my health less seriously as I went through college. I was unmedicated for both my ADHD (which only seemed to get worse with stress from both my health and school) and my depression during college, and besides from talk-therapy I felt as though I had no outlet. It became a constant and exhausting loop: stress/adhd —&amp;gt; not  taking care of myself —&amp;gt; denial —&amp;gt; depression/guilt. \\n\\nMy ADHD and depression quickly became insurmountable. I went into a weird phase of denial where I just would push my health and diabetes into the corner of my mind. I practically pretended like I didn’t have a chronic illness at all, and in a weird way it felt liberating. For once in my life, I didn’t feel as ostracized, didn’t feel like a burden to my friends and wasn’t  constantly worried about my future health. The denial was deep; I would first go weeks without testing my blood sugar, then months. \\n\\nBy the end of my senior year in college, I was testing my blood sugar once a month on average (if I was lucky!). I pushed it so far out of my mind that the idea of going back to managing my diabetes felt way too overwhelming. The guilt and depression manifested as anger and I would take it out in several different ways: blowing up at my friends over really trivial things, self-hatred, and indulging in really risky behavior. I gave myself a “timeline”, and in it I only saw myself living to 38-45 because of my poor diabetes management and risky behavior with drugs and alcohol. Drugs quickly became an escape mechanism, and a dangerously effective one at that. At this point, I just didn’t care. \\n\\nAround this time, I was hospitalized for DKA and put in the ICU for a week and a half. I’ve never felt worse in my life. I truly thought it was the end and that I was dying. I had no energy, couldn’t even stand without falling over, threw up everything I put into my body and just generally felt like the life had been sucked out of me. I was telling myself that “I knew my body” and could “read the signals of low/high blood sugar with little to no effort at all”. My hospitalization made me quickly realize that that wasn’t so. I wish I could say that it was a wake-up call, but it wasn’t. It only sent me into further denial and served as a sort of “threshold”, which I’d use to justify my reckless behavior. I would tell myself, “being in the hospital wasn’t *that* bad.” And it gave me the ability to falsely rationalize my inability to manage my health and life in general. \\n\\nNow I’m graduated college, looking for a job and still struggling immensely with my diabetes management, ADHD and depression. Having diabetes is a curse in itself, but coupled with mental illness and attention deficit disorders feels like a death sentence. I feel helpless and like such a burden, not only to my family and friends but to myself. In the meantime, I’ve met with a psychiatrist to treat my ADHD with medication. I plan on taking my depression more seriously as well, and will be seeking therapy soon. Has anyone else here dealt with depression and ADHD? What is your advice on how to turn my life around?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Diabetes depression and ADHDI ve had type 1 for 14 years this spring and can say confidently its had its fair share of ups and downs When I was first diagnosed at 9 years old I seemed to accept it with little to no trouble and adjusted to the lifestyle fairly quickly Sure it was tough especially as a kid but I always tried my best to remain positive and figured if i was to have a chronic disease I d prefer it to be something like type 1 diabetes and not something more fatal I ve also always struggled with depression and ADHD which as you can assume took quite the toll on my diabetes management and overall mental health Despite struggling with depression and ADHD I was always on top of my diabetes management trough grade school and high school which I largely attribute to my mom s help and guidance However once I went to college it all changed I moved across the country and was on my own for the first time in my life surrounded by completely new people in a state I had never even visited before and consequently my lifestyle completely changes as well With the pressure from school drinking and horrible eating habits my diabetes management quickly fell by the wayside I began checking less and less frequently and started taking my health less seriously as I went through college I was unmedicated for both my ADHD which only seemed to get worse with stress from both my health and school and my depression during college and besides from talk therapy I felt as though I had no outlet It became a constant and exhausting loop stress adhd gt not taking care of myself gt denial gt depression guilt My ADHD and depression quickly became insurmountable I went into a weird phase of denial where I just would push my health and diabetes into the corner of my mind I practically pretended like I didn t have a chronic illness at all and in a weird way it felt liberating For once in my life I didn t feel as ostracized didn t feel like a burden to my friends and wasn t constantly worried about my future health The denial was deep I would first go weeks without testing my blood sugar then months By the end of my senior year in college I was testing my blood sugar once a month on average if I was lucky I pushed it so far out of my mind that the idea of going back to managing my diabetes felt way too overwhelming The guilt and depression manifested as anger and I would take it out in several different ways blowing up at my friends over really trivial things self hatred and indulging in really risky behavior I gave myself a timeline and in it I only saw myself living to 38 45 because of my poor diabetes management and risky behavior with drugs and alcohol Drugs quickly became an escape mechanism and a dangerously effective one at that At this point I just didn t care Around this time I was hospitalized for DKA and put in the ICU for a week and a half I ve never felt worse in my life I truly thought it was the end and that I was dying I had no energy couldn t even stand without falling over threw up everything I put into my body and just generally felt like the life had been sucked out of me I was telling myself that I knew my body and could read the signals of low high blood sugar with little to no effort at all My hospitalization made me quickly realize that that wasn t so I wish I could say that it was a wake up call but it wasn t It only sent me into further denial and served as a sort of threshold which I d use to justify my reckless behavior I would tell myself being in the hospital wasn t that bad And it gave me the ability to falsely rationalize my inability to manage my health and life in general Now I m graduated college looking for a job and still struggling immensely with my diabetes management ADHD and depression Having diabetes is a curse in itself but coupled with mental illness and attention deficit disorders feels like a death sentence I feel helpless and like such a burden not only to my family and friends but to myself In the meantime I ve met with a psychiatrist to treat my ADHD with medication I plan on taking my depression more seriously as well and will be seeking therapy soon Has anyone else here dealt with depression and ADHD What is your advice on how to turn my life around</td>\n",

       "      <td>My 15 year old has had T1 for seven years. She’s had a tough road for a lot of reasons that aren’t even diabetes related, but of course it’s always been an added layer of wtf-ness. She uses a pump and a Dexcom (G6). Our last order of sensors got back ordered so we’re in the middle of a two week wait to get more. No big deal. We love the dexcom but it’s not unusual for her to take a break from it sometimes. \\n\\nWell we went out for lunch ch yesterday and she was annoyed because she forgot to charge her meter so she was waiting for it to come back to life with one of those portable chargers. Again, minor annoyance. She didn’t seem super stressed about it and we weren’t either. But, just making conversation, I did say something along the lines of are you missing the dexcom? This is when she kind of unloaded, saying she didn’t care, it sucked regardless, she was really freakin sick of having diabetes no matter what and nothing makes it better, etc etc. \\n\\nIn the moment, just trying to diffuse the situation, her dad and I did our best to empathize and support her, and also reiterated that even though it’s no ones fault that her pancreas crapped out, it’s all of our responsibility to manage it even when it sucks ass. She did calm down relatively quickly, and that was kind of that. But I know her well enough to know that was the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\nI know the obvious answer here is that diabetes burnout is a very real thing, painfully common among T1 teens, and she needs counseling. And I totally agree. She needs counseling for a lot of things and she has been in and out over the years. But the poor kid just doesn’t want to go. She’s so over it. I know we’re the parents here and we can force the issue but I am struggling with forcing her to do more diabetes-related shit she just doesn’t want to do. I mean, damn. I’m with her on this. I’m freaking sick of it too. I hate this for her more than I have words for. \\n\\nSo I turn to you, T1s of Reddit. With the full understanding that counseling is probably where we’ll end up on this, are there things we can do at home or in conjunction with her school nurse, etc., to help combat this in other ways? Do we enroll her in a sport or an acting class or something to distract her? Do we go full force and talk about it a lot to get it out in the open? Or do we just say screw it and keep beating the dead horse with therapy? I am just clueless and my heart hurts for my poor kid. \\n\\nThanks in advance, I appreciate this community a lot. I’ve lurked for years on another account and taken so many lessons from your experiences. Your strength and humor are humbling.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have a few that stick out. All were related to low sugar. \\n\\nBefore I switched to a pump and CGM, back when I was pretty disobedient and refused to test before making adjustments, I woke up in the middle of the night and my hands were numb and tingly, I immediately assumed it was high sugar and I grabbed a syringe and injected 4 units, then right after I reached for my tester.  \\nMy sugar was 38 and I confused the effects  of my low to just being tired, also realized I was laying and my hands and they were just asleep. \\n\\nOnce on a mountain drive, I started feeling low on the way home, tested and was 58, I reached in my lunch pale and realized I packed diet instead of regular, I was still about 20 min from the city, I started panicking and digging around while speeding and trying to maintain control of the vehicle, all while fighting the effects of a low, I found a single packet of sugar for coffee under my seat, I ate the entire thing and I made it to the store and grabbed soda, still feeling like shit but eventually got better. I believe that sugar packet was JUST enough to keep me steady till I got there. \\n\\nLast incident was with the pump, I have the Medtronic 670g. I was fairly new to the pump at the time and I was in a hurry, conversating, and I needed to change out the reservoir but didn't have time to change the tubing, I fucked up two things MAJOR, I left the tubing connected to my body and when i removed the empty reservoir I forgot to rewind the plunger so it was still all the way up. I filled the reservoir with 200 units of insulin and pushed it into the pump, it was hard to push in and I didn't think twice, it was because the plunger was up and as I was pushing in, I was pushing all the insuling outta the reservoir, through the tubing, and into my stomach. I only noticed because I got pain in my stomach. So I said wait a minute.. NOOOO... I pulled the reservoir out and sure enough, found out I injected myself with almost 200 units of insulin. I live right next to the hospital so I rushed there and they rushed me in the back, they blew some vains while trying to inject the D50 in a hurry, also struggled with my potassium levels crashing. It was a scary experience and painful. My sugar was about 32 for a couple hours, disgusting experience. Then I had to convince the Dr. it wasn't attempted suicide because he has never seen someone take that much.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What s your scariest experience with type 1 I have a few that stick out All were related to low sugar Before I switched to a pump and CGM back when I was pretty disobedient and refused to test before making adjustments I woke up in the middle of the night and my hands were numb and tingly I immediately assumed it was high sugar and I grabbed a syringe and injected 4 units then right after I reached for my tester My sugar was 38 and I confused the effects of my low to just being tired also realized I was laying and my hands and they were just asleep Once on a mountain drive I started feeling low on the way home tested and was 58 I reached in my lunch pale and realized I packed diet instead of regular I was still about 20 min from the city I started panicking and digging around while speeding and trying to maintain control of the vehicle all while fighting the effects of a low I found a single packet of sugar for coffee under my seat I ate the entire thing and I made it to the store and grabbed soda still feeling like shit but eventually got better I believe that sugar packet was JUST enough to keep me steady till I got there Last incident was with the pump I have the Medtronic 670g I was fairly new to the pump at the time and I was in a hurry conversating and I needed to change out the reservoir but didn t have time to change the tubing I fucked up two things MAJOR I left the tubing connected to my body and when i removed the empty reservoir I forgot to rewind the plunger so it was still all the way up I filled the reservoir with 200 units of insulin and pushed it into the pump it was hard to push in and I didn t think twice it was because the plunger was up and as I was pushing in I was pushing all the insuling outta the reservoir through the tubing and into my stomach I only noticed because I got pain in my stomach So I said wait a minute NOOOO I pulled the reservoir out and sure enough found out I injected myself with almost 200 units of insulin I live right next to the hospital so I rushed there and they rushed me in the back they blew some vains while trying to inject the D50 in a hurry also struggled with my potassium levels crashing It was a scary experience and painful My sugar was about 32 for a couple hours disgusting experience Then I had to convince the Dr it wasn t attempted suicide because he has never seen someone take that much</td>\n",

       "32    Since December (maybe even November/October) I've been struggling to properly regulate my blood sugar. Despite 7 years of experience, I've ran out of ideas for what is causing these irregular spikes. I would go see my doctor, but my appointment is still a another month away without any possibility of getting one sooner.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/625phcy37oh41.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fd46e754394737658712e47c25c90bcb742b65\\n\\nThe graph does a good job of representing how my blood sugar has been acting for a while now.\\n\\nThis is what a typical day looks like;\\n\\n1. I wake up within range of where I want to be(, sometimes without the initial spike shown at the end of the graph), which to me would indicate that my basal insulin (Toujeo) is fine.\\n2. I eat breakfast, usually 4 slices of bread with salami and cheese, which sends my sugar flying (the very first spike on the left is caused by this).\\n3. I take an additional dose of bolus insulin (Fiasp) to get the sugar back down.\\n4. After several (5-6+) hours, once my blood sugar is relatively close to range, I go for a 2nd meal (dinner) which either, despite any kind of fine tuning, sends my sugar flying up (13+) again or crashing down (3.5-). (What occurred on that graph is pretty unusual for me. where the dose seemed to actually be fine, but then later spiked up after me falling asleep.) Even when I attempt to regulate for a similar meal the following day with minor adjustments, the result is either the same or hard in the complete opposite direction.\\n5. The rest of the day is then usually spent trying to fix the chaos that the meals have caused, without being able to go for a 3rd meal that day before bed. This usually takes 1-3 additional doses of bolus (Fiasp) insulin to do.\\n\\nOther information:\\n\\n* During January I attempted to get more active at the gym. Before then I was taking 30 basal (Toujeo) units before bed, which was a new record high (throughout the 7 years) for me set in that month. After a few sessions at the gym, I was back down to my pre-December usual, 18 units. But this only increased the rate of the spikes, causing even more confusion and without still being able to eat more than twice a day just made me feel nauseous. So these days are mostly spent indoors with minimal activity.\\n* I've recently lowered my basal insulin to 19 (gradually down from 30 in January), as I'd wake up below range at night without any additional bolus insulin for hours prior to falling asleep. This does seem to change a lot though.\\n* Last summer I was able to regulate my blood sugar just fine. I was regularly jogging and otherwise relatively active. So I think I know how to dose under normal conditions.\\n\\nI've spent the better part of my functioning hours, those where I'm not experiencing strong symptoms, to find any sort of reasoning behind these irregular spikes and lack of control. I'm on my last semester at uni, which is certainly can be stressful, but wouldn't expect it to be the cause of this long period of consistent irregularities. Though I suppose it could have a spiraling effect, that again is just a another guess at something that might not even be related.\\n\\nWould love some input and suggestions. Thanks for reading. :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "109   Hi, I’m a 20 female.i was diagnosed with type 1 a little under two years ago. \\n\\nI had gallstones during my pregnancy that caused many complications for me. I spend 7 months in Hospital after my son was born and lost my pancreas in the process. \\n\\nIn the middle of last year, I fell pregnant. It wasn’t planned. Two days after the blood test got confirmed (I had only taken a at home test before that and the lines were very faint) I had a miscarriage. \\n\\nAlthough my partner and I were devastated it was easier to accept as we weren’t planning and we’ve have already had our fair share of devastating news in the last year or so. \\n\\nAfter all that trauma had passed, we seriously talked about expanding our family. We originally wanted at least 4 kids but I honestly struggle with my sugar so we knew that wasn’t going to happen. \\n\\nAfter talking we decided to have one more kid, regardless of gender, and we’d stop. I want to get my tubes tied after our last kid as to not experience anymore unwanted pregnancy as the doctor said they’d all most likely end in miscarriages. \\n\\nI started to work with my doctor, a diabetes nurse and a dietician to work towards a healthy pregnancy. My sugar has improved so much but it’s nowhere near perfect and we’ve had to push make the ‘conceiving’ date twice now..\\n\\nSo, one with the actually post...\\n\\nMy last period was in November. I’ve missed 3 periods now. \\n\\nI’ve taken 3 at home test, all spanned out over the months and all of them negative. \\n\\nI wasn’t worried at first because my period had been unreliable in the past, I thought that perhaps that cycle was starting again. \\n\\nAfter the third month hit, I got worried and went to my doctor for a blood test. \\n\\nI got the results back today. She said they were inconclusive. \\n\\nI’m not a medical expert so sorry for this bad explanation... \\n\\nShe said if the human grow hormone (I think that’s what it’s called?) is below 5 you’re not pregnant and if it’s above 25 you are pregnant. Mine was 10. \\n\\nShe said, it could be too early to tell and to come back for another blood test in two weeks. \\n\\nI was very angry (?) and confused. I was sure that I definitely wasn’t in the early stages of pregnancy because my period has been late for around 6 weeks so IF I was pregnant I should be further along then that. \\n\\nMy instant conclusion was that I must have fell pregnant late last year and had miscarriage and I didn’t bleed so I might get I’ll etc etc. it was a moment of panic since my first miscarriage was traumatic and I really wasn’t thinking straight. \\n\\nLater that day, tonight, I thought about what my doctor said and the logic of it all. If I did have a miscarriage last year there wouldn’t be any traces of the hormone left would there? \\n\\nI was confused and upset. \\n\\nI couldn’t wait two more weeks to find out, Especially since I’ve had two semi low sugars for my readings. My sugar is supposed to be between 4-10. My sugars were all 4.3 and 4 which make me start to shake and feel sick. \\n\\n\\n I took a at home kit again, basically to prove to myself that it was nothing and shake the anxiety... \\n\\nIt came up positive right away, not even the weird very faint line that happened during the miscarriage, it looked normally.\\n\\n(This is important to me because my doctor said that the faint line would have been because there wasn’t enough of the hormone in my system to detect. That my sugar levels would have caused an early development defect in the embryo and it wouldn’t have formed correctly, so it stopping growing and produced the hormone.) \\n\\n\\nSo I figured that if the results from the test I did a few days ago said my levels a low but they were higher enough to appear on a at home test then perhaps I am pregnant and there may be a chance of a successful pregnancy. \\n\\nI’ve been told by almost all the medical experts in my life that the best way to achieve a healthy pregnancy and baby is to have perfect sugar not only during the pregnancy but while you conceive and the first few weeks. \\n\\nIt basically lays down a perfect foundation for the embryo to form upon. I’m sure my sugar levels haven’t been the best...  No major lows but a few highs. My highest level is supposed to be 10, I’ve had 15-17. \\n\\nHas anyone had a similar problem? Not the best levels during the start but had a healthy baby?

       "224   Hi,\\n\\nI am a 17yr old T1D (diagnosed Sep. 2018) in Canada and for the past few days I've been considering upgrading from my **current setup** of: The Freestyle Libre + MDI using Humalog/Lantus (Regular Pens)\\n\\nI have **looked into pumps** including the tubeless omnipod and after having been initially intrigued by the Tandem/Dexcom combo (due to the level of automation, control, and accuracy it seems to provide), I decided pumps weren't worth it for me at this time due to:\\n\\n* The discomfort of having a pump on 24/7 esp. w/ exercise, bumping into things, showering, sleeping, sweating, etc. (e.g. I was totally horrified w/ insulin pens at the start - I would sit 30 mins. and not be able to inject myself)\\n* The potential for developing scar tissue and finding new spots to keep putting pumps at (esp. as the years go by)\\n* My A1C has been throughout the 6's (as low as 6.3 and as high as 6.9) which doesn't seem to call for pump usage (according to me diabetes nurse) - my TDD has generally been less than 30 units - sometimes as low as 15 if I am extremely low carb.\\n\\n**What I am now considering is:** using a Freestyle Libre w/ a Smart Insulin Pen. Does anyone know if this (see link) has materialized and what the extent of the technology is? \\n\\n[https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/novo-nordisks-new-insulin-pens-will-integrate-abbotts-freestyle-libre-system](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/novo-nordisks-new-insulin-pens-will-integrate-abbotts-freestyle-libre-system) \\n\\nMy **ideal vision** for diabetes management would be the following if it could happen: one app where one can track their food (so carbs AND protein are automatically determined based on grams of x, y, or z in your meal), then based on the BG readings from the Libre you are given the amount of insulin you should take (it would sense changes in your insulin sensitivity and adapt your carb/protein to insulin ratio accordingly as time passes), it then tracks your insulin on board (and keeps it in mind at future meals/exercise), if you exercise you can input that (it adapts accordingly), if it senses a daily dawn phenomenon, or blood sugar going low, the AI could automatically tell you to increase/decrease basal or to bolus insulin or to eat x grams of carbs (almost like an artifical pancreas). To clarify: The AI would keep in mind the amount of insulin your using from the smart pen and would learn to adjust over time.\\n\\nAdditional Ideas: It could suggest foods that don't work well with you, or keep in mind your dieting preferences. It could have a satiety option and suggest meals you've had in the past that make you full yet don't raise your BG. It could optimize for micronutrients in food as well and tell you what you're lacking in.\\n\\nWhat's the closest to that there now is? What are the options in Canada?\\n\\nBTW: the reason I'm going for the Libre and not Dexcom is it seems to last a bit longer (14 vs. 10 days) and it doesn't seem as intrusive (a bit smaller) and it seems a bit more convenient.\\n\\nThanks a lot!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Anyone's who's interested in participating, please comment or PM me.**\\n\\nThe basic idea is to agree on a simple experimental protocol, each of us run the experiment, combine and analyze the data, and see if we can figure out 1) Is the shower effect real or a CGM artifact and 2) how does it vary from person-to-person?\\n\\nThe 7 of us organized and worked out the protocol using group chat and and a new subreddit, [r/QuantifiedDiabetes](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedDiabetes/). **We're starting the experiments and looking for more participants.**\\n\\nHere's the details:\\n\\n* Background:\\n   * In [u/NeutyBooty](https://www.reddit.com/u/NeutyBooty/)'s post on [hot showers causing blood glucose to rise](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ev6zsb/does_anyone_elses_readings_go_up_after_a_hot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), lot's of commenters confirmed the general observation, but for some it appeared to be a CGM artifact, for some it matches BGM, and for others they see a BG drop.\\n   * From my PMs, some of us have CGM's, some have regular BGM's, and some have both.\\n* Questions to answer:\\n   * Is the \"hot shower effect\" a real change in blood glucose or an artifact of CGM sensors getting warm (or some other environmental change)?\\n   * What is the person-to-person variation in the magnitude and direction of the \"hot shower effect?\"\\n* Protocol:\\n   * Pick a time when your blood glucose is relatively stable (no recent meals, medication, exercise, etc.)\\n   * Turn on the shower to the hottest temperature you're comfortable with and let the temperature stabilize. If possible, measure the temperature (e.g. with an instant read thermometer).\\n   * Measure your blood glucose with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.\\n      * If you don't have both types of meters, use whichever you do have (data will still be useful for the second goal)\\n   * Take a 20 minute shower.\\n   * As soon as you finish the shower, measure your blood glucose again with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.\\n   * Monitor your blood sugar for one hour (measure every 15 min. for finger-stick meter)\\n   * Record anything that might have affected blood glucose during the experiment.\\n   * Repeat the experiment multiple times (preferably ≥3, but any data is better than nothing) to assess within-person variability.\\n   * Post your data in a comment or PM to [u/sskaye](https://www.reddit.com/u/sskaye/). I'll compile it and make available to everyone to analyze\\n      * If you want your data to be anonymous, just let me know and I'll remove all identifying info.\\n   * Optional variations:\\n      * Vary the time or temperature of the shower\\n      * Try a bath, hot tub, or sauna instead of a shower.\\n* Data to collect:\\n   * For each glucose measurement: time, blood glucose, any important observations\\n   * General: whatever demographic info you're comfortable sharing (e.g. male/female, T1/T2/LADA, age)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "318   Howdy fellow T1s!\\n\\nFirst off, I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now.  I have been waiting for this for so long it's not even funny.\\n\\nBut let's talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I've been on Control IQ.\\n\\nSensor errors.\\n\\nSo I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session.  Was it slightly confusing after the hour+ long training that I didn't actually have to pair my pump to a device?  Yes.\\n\\nWorkaround: I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump.  Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected.  Probably won't have to deal with the likes of this again.  But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired.  We'll see..\\n\\nSo that sensor error...\\n\\nI awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing.  This was not, repeat, not, a compression low.  I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour (after waking up).  I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 (twice). \\n\\nWhat I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do.\\n\\nI calibrated.\\n\\nIt buzzed and told me to test again. I did so and recalibrated.\\n\\nWithin a couple minutes, the rise to 160 began on the pump.  But it didn't do it all at once.  It did it gradually over 20 minutes.   Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar.  It kicked in 2.5 units...  Um...\\n\\nSo I suspended basal and waited an hour.  I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings.  Still had a ton on board though.  It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while.  \\n\\nThis was not a relaxing experience.\\n\\nFast forward to today.  I changed the sensor last night (it was getting flakey in the evening).  This morning there was an actual compression low.  Even though I was in suspend mode, I was actually 170.  I waited for it to raise back up, after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio.  Figured that would knock me down to the 120-130 range.  But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not work out and I ended up going low.\\n\\nSO...  IN THE FUTURE...  \\n\\nAny time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low, I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour.  By then, whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won't have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change.\\n\\nIt should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience.  This may be a rare occurrence.  But if it happens to you, maybe what I'm trying will work for you.\\n\\nI'll report here if it happens again.  Also, I'll report it to customer service as well.\\n\\nHas anyone else had anything weird happen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "328   At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway - not for everyone, but for hand-picked DM I patients like me. I had the Libre 1 before (I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself), and it was good.\\n\\nHowever, the Libre 2 is a relevation. I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms - when they work.\\n\\nThe problem: When you put on the sensor, you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App. After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor, which is exactly 2 weeks. (You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app, but the alarms will go to the reader. I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms. If you activate with the App, the reader won't work.) \\n\\nI do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times, so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3. Also, I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch, a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE. This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife.\\n\\nWhen it works - which it did at times -, the system is absolutely brilliant. It kind of gave me a new lease of life. I exercise very much, and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia.\\n\\nBUT: **The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best.** After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious \"No alarms\" warning in the app.\\n\\nDespite this, **the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings \"No connection with the sensor\" regularly, also at night.** All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep!\\n\\nLast night I was woken by several of these false alarms. This morning I got stupid \"no connection alarms\" all through the morning. The program asks you to check you sensor, but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11:30 a.m. that at my glucose was 14 mmol/l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin. So **when the system state is \"No connection\", the system will not warn about hyper- and hypoglucemia.**\\n\\nAbbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless. The whole system is a black box. Part of it works through Near field communication (NFC), part through Bluetooth (you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone), but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone's Bluetooth configuration pages.\\n\\nI have 2 **questions** to the community:\\n\\n**(1) Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue?**\\n\\n**(2) Which smartphone do you use?** I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand. - Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue? Can anyone with Sony Xperia Z5 confirm that the LibreLink App gives out correct alarms? Is there another android phone that works reliably against a Libre 2?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "388   Hello to everyone who reads this, I’ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors. I’m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on. I’ve been excessively thirsty, urinating way more than usual, including during the night which I’ve NEVER done before, extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class, and above all I’ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat. All I was told was my glucose was high, and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment, and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension. She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn’t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today. Well, yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day, and then I ate lunch with a friend. Shortly after getting lunch (we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating) I had a migraine and stomach pain again, and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could. At about 7:30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn’t feel nearly that bad. I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9:00 when I couldn’t stand it anymore, mind you, I’ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER, so it’s obviously bad. I tell the nurse everything that’s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done, I just kinda got sent away. The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton. The CT scan comes back normal, which isn’t surprising, and I’m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches, and then the nurse came in and discharged me. At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them, not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER. I feel incredibly stupid. I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on, and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork. I’m just at a loss for words, and I don’t know what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "467   Hi, Sorry for such a long post, I just got Diagnosed as a Ti diabetic 14 days ago. 29-year-old male 250 Lbs. A little back story Never knew I had TI until a few weeks ago I started getting extremely dry mouth, urinating tons. Then I woke up throwing up, I threw up over 30 times and had zero energy, legit felt like I was dying, I thought I had food poisoning, boy was I wrong! If my mother didn't help me I would be dead right now. Thinking back on it we should have just called 911 for an ambulance. I used the last percent of energy to get into the car and she drove me to the ER. They rushed me in and my blood sugar level was over 1000. They could not get blood out of me, it was coagulating. But they finally did. I spent 6 days in ICU, the intensive care unit. My potassium levels were super low, got IV's over and over. Finally made it out and they discharged me. I feel so much better and I am so grateful to be alive and survive. The doctors said they have never seen such a high level over 1000 BS. I am on a low carb Keto diet now. I take 35 units of Levemir in the morning and take Novolog with each meal 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My blood sugar level has been in the 100's like 188 to 130 for this past week but every time around 3pm to 5pm my Blood sugar starts to drop to like 90, then 80, then 70, when this happens I drink some orange juice or glucose liquid or gel, then it spikes back up to 130 and stays like that till the morning. I have no idea why my BS keeps dropping like this every day. It's a pattern. I have been calling my doctor about and she now has me Minus 5 units for lunch and now dinner. I know that I just got diagnosed and its a feel out process my doctor doesn't know the right insulin intake yet because it's only been 2 weeks. But this scares me so much and I am afraid to go to sleep every night and is overall very stressful for me. I am doing great with my new diet. I just dip in the middle of the day. I take an AC1 test in a few weeks. I am just so new to this and wonder if anybody can help me or know why this is happening to me. \\nThis is what I have been eating every day- its the same thing everyday lol  \\n--Breakfast at 8am--\\n- 1 Cup of Cheerios cereal\\n- 1 cup of milk\\n- 1 light yogurt   - Meal equals    = 50 Carbs\\n--Snack at 10am--\\n1- boost drink\\n2- Babybel Cheeses\\n1 turkey meat stick, it's a little one  Meal equals = 28 Carbs \\n\\n--Lunch at 12 pm--\\n- McDonald's Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken \\n- 3 tablespoons of salad dressing ^  \\n- 1 cucumber with 3 cherry tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of Salad dressing.          Meal equals = 57 Carbs\\n\\n--Snack at 2 pm--\\n- 1 Apple \\n- 3 tablespoons of Cashew or Almond butter\\n- 3 Babybel Cheeses\\n- 1 or 2 turkey meat sticks    Meal equals = 40 carbs\\n\\n--Dinner at 4pm--\\n- Chicken Breast cooked in butter \\n- Salad with cucumbers 3 tablespoons of dressing, added spinach and greens\\n- 2 cups of broccoli\\n- 1 greek yogurt with 4 blueberries added to it   Meal equals =35 Carbs\\nI just wanted to put what I have been eating everyday, I am new to this and I feel like I have adjusted well since this turned my whole world upside down and I feel very scared, basically not knowing next to any information when I left the hospital. If anybody out there reads this thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can help me with any information, tips or insight about why the level keeps dropping this reply to this. I am fighting and I will never give up, I am beating this, I just want to be stable blood sugar level and be able to do stuff. Sorry for the insanely long post. I do not know what to do and I am scared. I love you all and God bless, I am on the edge hoping I get a response because this is so new to me. Thanks again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "542   TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nSo, I switched insurance companies recently (thank you USA for your crappy insurance policy).\\n\\nMy G5 transmitter died with only a week's warning. I know, I should have paid better attention.\\n\\nI contacted my new insurance company to figure out who I needed to go through to get them to pay for part of my new G5.\\n\\nI have sensors due to multiple failures from earlier times that Dexcom kindly replaced. I was just trying to get a new G5 transmitter.\\n\\n\"Hello, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\" Crazy Lady at medical supply company my insurance pays for.\\n\\nI told her my name.\\n\\n\"Hello! And what can I help you with today?\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I'd like to see if you guys carry the G5 transmitter.\" -me\\n\\n\"We certainly do carry the G4 transmitter! Shall I start a new account for you?\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"I said the G5 transmitter. I'm not interested in the G4.\" -me\\n\\n\"They don't make a G5 transmitter. They make G5 sensors and a G4 transmitter that goes with the G5 sensors.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"Umm... What? I've been on the G5 for 2 years now.\" -me\\n\\n\"You must be mistaken. The sensors that come with the G4 transmitter are labeled as G5, but they do not make a G5 transmitter.\" -Crazy Lady\\n\\n\"No, the sensors are labeled as working with both the G4 and the G5 transmitters.

The G5 is the sensors to the G4. There is no such thing as a-\" -Crazy Lady, as I hung up on her.\\n\\nSigh.\\n\\nI called the other company my insurance covers.\\n\\nThey had it, and are shipping it out to me expedited.\\n\\nI can't believe I wasted so much time trying to get an idiot to believe something she knew she was right about.\\n\\nTL;DR I switched insurance companies. The crazy lady on the phone didn't believe me that there was a Dexcom G5 transmitter, when I've been on it for 2 years now. Insisted she was right, and that Dexcom only makes a G4 and a G6. Hung up on her while she was insisting I contact Dexcom to prove she was right. Called another company, which had it, and is shipping it to me ASAP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "655   Hello reddit users and other T1D I am new to the reddit thing and I’ve basically been looking for support since I’ve been diagnosed... all my family members who have had T1D are no longer with us so I’m fighting this by myself and blindly. \\n\\nSo let me just say that my father was diagnosed at 25 and he never took it seriously and it took his life. My grandmother (moms side) got diagnosed at like 60? Due to a car accident. Through out my life i was warned about this disease and so were my brothers, of course like the rest of us I ignored it and kept being a kid eating anything and everything. My life hasn’t been very great and a lot of it I couldn’t help because I was a kid, I’m currently 23 years old right now. Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night. You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles? Yeah I’d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes. I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day, l was even craving the most random things I’ve never craved before.. after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant! So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said “your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you’re under DKA” all I could say was ok. I called my mom and said “mom I’m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly...I have diabetes.” There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry. I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room. Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here. I don’t have insurance and my job isn’t very good, they’ve cut my hours because of how sick I’ve been. I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn’t listen to me.. she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin (Levemir, Novolog) at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM, over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm. After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir... my sugars were still sitting in the 380 - 420 I kept begging her that it’s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I’m killing myself rather than helping myself.. I ended up losing about 30+ pounds in 3 months. I was 145 lbs before diagnosed, today 1/9/2020 I’m now 114lbs and not happy at all... I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels, for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I’m not even financially stabled or have insurance. On 1/4/2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out, turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 (in June it was at 7.5) thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that’s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus! Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that’s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir ... so even when I was injecting myself with insulin.....nothing was happening ... to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I’ve been using Levemir it wasn’t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I’m doing everything I can possibly do... I want to be apart of this community and have people I can talk to when things get overwhelming, my boyfriend is my supporter but he still doesn’t fully understand how much this effects someone, is there anyone else how there who struggles to live daily because they aren’t stable I’m tired of feeling alone with this stupid sickness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "738   This might cause a debate, but hear me out, i’m not here to offend anyone or make fun of it by any means, cause i am a type one diabetic now since beginning of 2017. Back in December of 2016, on the 16th, i was approached by 2 males who asked me to use my phone cause they were lost, i said sure. I handed them my phone, afterwards they proceeded to tell me to empty my pockets. At first i was confused, then i realized i was being robbed. They had no weapon out at the time, but they tried to cover their face after i already seen their faces when they asked to use my phone. I’m a brown belt in karate and blue belt in brazilian jiu-jitsu, i felt like i could more than handle these guys. I threw a punch, knocked out the first guy and took the other guy down and started fighting him on the ground, 20 or so seconds go by and i felt a sharp kind of hit to the top of my head, my shoulder, my lower back, stomach, arms, at first i thought it was some brass studded knuckles, but they both got up and ran. I realized what had just happened, i was stabbed multiple times. I was very lucky to run 3 blocks to the hospital with a collapsed lung, i made it. I fell unconscious from blood loss in the front entrance of the hospital and nurses saw me and i was wheelchaired in. I woke up to many nurses and doctors working on stitching me up and pumping blood into me. Fast forward to next day. I was told the severity of the stabbing, i was stabbed 3 times in the cranium, once in the lung, 3 times in my back (they just missed my L4 &amp;amp; L5 vertebrae’s) which i would of lost all motor mobility of my body, i was also stabbed in the hand, arm, shoulder, and the back of my neck. I needed brain surgery, a piece of the knife was imbedded into my skull and JUST millimetres from my brain. Surgery went great, i recovered and took me about 3 weeks before i was discharged. fast forward about one month, i started having pains on the top of my head where i had surgery, i went to the hospital and i had a very rare blood infection in my body from the dirty knife i was stabbed with. (hunting blade) and i needed to take IV medication everyday for 2 hours, they told me if i don’t take it, there’s a 90% chance i’ll die from this infection, but this medication had side effects, i didn’t want to hear it, i was too stressed out at that point. I did the IV medication for nearly 6 weeks, the infection was gone from my body. Fast forward 1 month, i’m back living with my parents, i was always tired, sleeping, no appetite and short of breath. My mom is type 2, she tested my BG and it was 27.0 mmol. She took me to the hospital right away, i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 20, weight 210, 6’2, i was healthy, ate normal, and lived a normal life. I’m now a type 1 diabetic, forever. I want opinions or to hear any feedback on this, i’m not blaming it on the medication i took, but it’s a big chance it was. Thank you for reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "787   I posted a [thread here 7 months ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/bldosc/need_help_trying_to_understand_budget_us_insurance/) looking for advice about moving to the US from another country.\\n\\n\\nI've now been in the US since the end of October and healthcare is really the only thing that remains a pain in the arse.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm enrolled on my partner's work health care plan now, which is by Anthem Blue Cross (we did think initially this was Blue Shield). The plan cost $28 a month for my partner, but once I was added on the price unexpectedly went up to ~$250. This is even before getting any medication. My partner works part time, and I'm unable to work until I get my paperwork from the government, and even then who knows how long it will take for me to find work. Since I couldn't enroll in medicare we figured the only option was to go with the work benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey wouldn't tell us their formulary before signing up and we had to wait until coverage started yesterday. Upon looking, most insulins are not covered. **I am currently on Novorapid (Novolog in the US I think?) and Tresiba, both of which are listed as 'EXCLUDED' on the formulary. Humalog and Lantus are listed, however, are these the closest comparable insulins? Which combination would you recommend?**\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel really bad about how much this plan will take from my partner's pay cheque, so I was considering outright getting private coverage out of my own pocket. **Are there any good / more affordable plans out there? Or am I better sticking with my partner's coverage?** I did look at Blue Shield but I have to call to get a quote. Unfortunately, this whole thing is incredibly stressful and confusing and the only area I've kind of felt out of my depth and I keep getting more questions and I'm not sure where to head to have them answered.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few other things,\\n\\n\\n* Our understanding is we need to set up a primary care doctor first, discuss with them what I need, and they refer me to an Endo who is in our network, who then will write a prescription for me and I go and take that to a pharmacy. Is this correct?\\n\\n\\n\\n* What would be the correct course of action for going via a community pharmacy for 340b prices? Follow the same steps as above, and then sign up at the local community health centre?\\n\\n\\n\\n* Could the endo add things to the prescription that aren't listed on the formulary and I still get coverage, or is that just up to me to pay the full amount? CGMs are on the formulary as 'non-preferred', if I filled out the FreeStyle Libre form on their website, and got a prescription, do I still have to pay full price for the sensors, for example?\\n\\n\\n\\n* Which insulins have manufacturer discounts? I think most of the Novo Nordisk ones have them available, but it doesn't seem like these are covered by my insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much for your help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "802   Okay, so I have been using Tandem's Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all, before this experiment, I was DIY looping with Omnipod (off-label). Being off-label, this system has it's quirks, but there are a couple features, intensity, and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBefore jumping into what I like and don't like about Control IQ, I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works. \\n\\nFirst off, Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal. The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading (it's only integrated with Dexcomg G6) to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus, just be increased, no change at all, be decreased, or be completely suspended. The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes. Below is the Control IQ tier system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n ≥  **180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg/dL within 30 minutes, there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus. The correction bolus is 60% of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg/dL every 60 minutes. This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing.\\n\\n**160 - 180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **increased**. \\n\\n**112.5 - 159 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **not changed**. \\n\\n**112.4 - 70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **decreased**. \\n\\n ≤  **70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, basal is **suspended**. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy thoughts...\\n\\nAfter about 3 days of using Control IQ, my average is higher than what I like. However there are less lows which is awesome. BUT, my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping.  The reason for this is that unlike looping, Control IQ software doesn't not use **carbs on board**. Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten.  This would be fine, if you didn't have to use the CGM reading, but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus, the Tandem pump doesn't remember how many carbs on are board. \\n\\nFor instance, I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg/dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced  bolus of 0.6 U. I then \"trying to be good\" used the recommendation. I then decided to have an apple, so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams, but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg/dL, the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin, it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg/dL. This isn't super high, but this could have been completely avoided. ALSO, I couldn't stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions, I would have been much higher. It recommended 0U, but I took 0.7U (usually I'm about 1U for an apple). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other feature I'm not crazy about is the tube. I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years, so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D, but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice, especially during workouts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple features I DO like...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like that the software works, all the time. Even if it isn't nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be, I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments. With my closed loop Omnipod system, I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink (device used to connect pod to phone) and phone were connected and working. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt's also nice not to have to carry an additional device (the rileylink), but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump. So that's not a big change.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like the sleep feature. This allows for a tighter range, but doesn't allow for the automated correction bolus. However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg/dL, your basal is increased. With normal settings, basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg/dL or above. \\n\\nOh, and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem, however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOverall I think for the masses, Control IQ could be rather helpful tool. However,  I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me, but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTAKEAWAY: Control IQ is less work but doesn't allow the as tight control compared to looping. DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on, but I like the control, and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*This is just a short snapshot, I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ. I have early access to this because I'm a T1D, CDE, and a RDN. It's a bit of work to review and report, but I hope this information is helpful to you.*   \n",
       "847   Hello all! I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer, in my case, my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons, and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue. I also take biologic meds for my illness, and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses, including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer. \\n\\nI’ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes, and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes, the illness doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the person’s daily life, and their overall ability to function and work a normal job. \\n\\nI’ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories, where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me’s in order to cover the costs of insulin, or having to resort to “Walmart insulin” (that sounds atrocious) when they don’t have insurance, and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance. \\n\\nNO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes. Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things, and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d. \\n\\nWhat are your options where you live, in the event that you don’t have health insurance? How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn’t available? \\n\\nSome states offer Medicaid, and among the states that offer Medicaid, some offer a program called “Medicaid buyin” where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market. Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid, or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid?\\n\\nRegarding employment, how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance, as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don’t have to cover health insurance? \\n\\nIf you do have a job that offers you health insurance, have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance? The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment. I don’t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person’s ability to access a life-sustaining medication, this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor, that’s it. \\n\\nI realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive, but are generally able-bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands. This would also include working long hours, as well as overtime. Someone like myself wouldn’t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes. Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized, compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities? My condition wouldn’t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds, but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn’t want to remain in that state for any length of time. \\n\\nAnd, lastly, how does your illness impact things for you socially? Are there social situations, job situations, or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative, judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you? How have strangers reacted? How have friends and/or significant others reacted?\\n\\nI live in Colorado, where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions. Here are the links for that, as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state. Your state may have a similar buyin program, I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized. \\n\\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/hcpf/medicaid-buy-program-working-adults-disabilities\\n\\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm\\n\\nAlso- feel free to ask me any questions about my autoimmune disease! I’m intrigued by science and medical stuff, and how it impacts our daily lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "923   Hi, I’m Kaylynn. My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic. He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult. My husband takes 2 different insulin’s 1 of them is long acting Lantus &amp; the other is fast acting Humalog. \\nUnfortunately &amp; absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail, he has been they’re since 9-27-19 - presently. We had talked to somebody who works there, who answered questions we had, I had brought up my husband’s diabetes &amp; the difficulties he faces with his diabetes, this woman “assured” me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and “knew what they were doing” They’re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different, when my husband first went in it took 2-3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him, learn about his medical conditions/medications all that stuff. He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are @ 7am he gets both Lantus &amp; Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of, @ 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin’s then the night medications that were approved. Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm. That’s it. \\nOkay, now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much, please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I’m saying, is there anything I can try to do about this? Recommendations? I’d very much appreciate it. I’m lost with what I can even do about this. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙏🏻😔 I know this is really long, please bare with me, I’m new here &amp; trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand. Okay here we go. \\nSo, this is what started first then so on, so on \\nI received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly “he doesn’t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I’m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn’t care. So I got up, got dressed &amp; got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I’ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house. I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call &amp; explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home, &amp; that since you all are administrating his medications to him, calling in refills, etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills. And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail, and we don’t know when or if he’s going to be released. \\nI know this is very long so I’m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it’s very important. \\n• I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that “contact the pharmacy” because that’s not they’re responsibility. And that whoever basically is his other half, emergency contact, on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications. \\n•So what I’ve been dealing with lately is when he calls (not every call) but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left. If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won’t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up &amp; then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine. \\n•These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him, that what they were wanting to do would not “help him at all” they forced him to take it and he nearly OD. So then they put him back on his original dose\\nThere’s been so much damn more. This is already long as hell. \\nSo lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin’s and put him only on Novolog 70/30 and he said no he wouldn’t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him. \\n•He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn’t know what he’s talking about having to do with his insulin, but 100% without a doubt think they know what they’re doing!! \\nThey’re wrong af, changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable. There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20-30units when his sugars to high?!?! That would kill him!!! \\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP PLEASE PLEASE DO!! I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1203  I was originally writing this as a comment for another post but I got too way many thoughts on this so I just had to make this it’s own thread.....\\n\\nCan I just take this as an opportunity to point out that the perception that the A1C metric of average glucose control is good? It’s not. It’s total bullshit. It’s laughable and anytime an endo excitedly pats me on the back for having a good one it immediately makes me want to look for a new endo. Which I’ve done a lot. \\n\\nTest your endo, if this metric is their only quantitative assessment of your behaviors as a diabetic then you have a shitty endo. I have met a lot of shitty endos so it’s a trigger with many indicators that I’m very sensitive too. \\n\\nAn A1C purportedly gives you a metric correlative to your long term glucose average over the past several weeks. My A1C is always amazing. Like weirdly so. But it’s not because I’m a great T1. It’s because I’m a really bad one lol. Or maybe a really good one with bad days? Or a great one? I’m not sure and that’s the point. An A1C is incapable of distinguishing whether anyone is good or bad. \\n\\nMy glucose control has two main modes of behavior on any given day. First is just very flat all day between 120-160. So pretty much perfect. A mode that would lend itself to a great A1C in the end. I drink a lot of water, run, and am very strategic about the carb quality more than the count of the carb for any given meal on these days (fast carbs = bad). A philosophy that’s never taught but yields way better control than anything an endo or diabetic educator could show you. I always assumed this good/bad carb thing is an intuition all T1s get several years into having it. \\n\\nThe second mode of glucose behavior is a day I’m active and wanting tons and tons of short acting sugary things (ice cream, cake, chocolate) combined with TONS of caffeine. These are my ‘I’m young and strong and can do tf I want days’ where I’m generally in a great mood and not giving any fucks. Not a great example of health in any light but we gotta love ourselves. Sometimes that means being self indulgent. To my point though, on these days my sugar is a harmonic set of fast moving roller coaster waves. Huge and quick glucose spikes in the high 200 to low 300 range (because it’s short acting carbs) followed by insulin over compensating followed by huge and very fast / sudden drops into lows below 50/60 (again, short acting carbs). The insulin over compensating is an intentional part of the scam too by the way. I over compensate means I get to eat more junk food in the end....As you can surmise, I should not be proud of these days. \\n\\nBut type-1 diabetics have very cool cheat codes in normal life the normie’s don’t get such as \\n\\n-huge control over our energy levels in any state of activity (marathon runners unite! set your basal to zero and cruise by everyone else 😎), \\n\\n-or our own ghetto version of Aderall (lows keep you spritely and very awake at 4am), \\n\\n-or ‘food entitlement’ so you don’t have to share your freakin’ fries. The ‘can’t share I took insulin for that sorry’ has never failed. \\n\\nI will very ashamedly exploit all of these on occasion. I will say it now, I know this paragraph will trigger people and totally agree 99% of this is horrible advice. But most of you would be lying if you said you’ve never done any of these. \\n\\nHere’s the kicker though, if an A1C is a long term average of the past several weeks what do days of repeated huge spikes and repeated huge lows average out too? Well, a spike of 260 and a low of 40 average out to 150.....a number that would if by itself be represented with a great A1C. In an aforementioned ‘roller coaster day’ this whole day would then theoretically yield an awesome A1C. \\n\\nUltimately, if these are the two main modes of glucose behavior I have then my A1C is always awesome. Tons of highs mixed with tons of lows gives you the same A1C as a perfectly flat line at 150.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1207  So 3 days ago I was do for a pump renewal as my 5 years was up. I am a tslim user since November 24, 2014. I have had many pumps that have broken in the past, most diagnosed as a battery failure/malfunction. The broken pumps had nothing to do with anything I did wrong except for one where the screen cracked while I was sleeping.\\n\\n1 month ago I was contacted by Tandem and they told me I would be getting upgraded when my pump warranty was up in a month. The localbrep Jordyn Dooley was nice and got me all set up with a customer service rep. Both were very enthusiastic about me getting the new pump. During the last 2 weeks I went and got the dexcom G6 in anticipation for my new tslim pump.\\n\\nSo this past Monday I never got the renewal call as promised. Tuesday, no call. Now I am concerned and I called them. They tell me someone will call me back. Today I call them and I got told that they won't be issuing me a new pump and to call my doctor. I asked to speak to a supervisor because the woman on the phone was being very short and rude towards me and I could sense a very bad time in her voice. She refused to get me a supervisor and hung up. I called back and the next customer service rep, Brooke, told me there was no one at all at Tandem for me to talk to. After some back and forth with her she tells me that the Director of Sales will call me on Monday, I ask for his name and she mumbles some profanity then hangs up.\\n\\nSo now I am pretty upset and I call back again. She just keeps picking up and immediately disconnecting, and this happened like 5 or 6 times. I am beginning to have some panic attacks, this is my life and I am not calling about getting like my gutters cleaned here... I go upstairs and ask my wife to call from her phone. The customer service rep, Brooke, immediately answers and is now talking to my wife. She is extremely rude to my wife when she realizes my wife is calling to get some information for me. She gives my wife the name of the Director of Sales, Jim Simpson, but refuses to give any other info on how to contact him. Ultimately she just hangs up on my wife as well. \\n\\n5 hours later I actually get a call from Jim Simpson. He tells me I am no longer a good fit for Tandem because I am not a good look for them with all of the broken pumps I have had. I tell him that I don't be live that is very fair as the pumps that have broken were not my fault. I mean it's not like I have done anything to cause the pumps to break, I live a very normal life, although I do have many problems from my 32 years with diabetes; kidney disease, advanced retinopathy, and neuropathy. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, but that is all of the activity I am involved in, so the pumps are not put through any stress. \\n\\nWhat do I do from here? Diabetes is enough of a problem and it has been a lot on my wife and my son, on top of all of the other problems that have come from my diabetes. To be treated like this by a company that is supposed to be doing things to make life better for diabetics is extremely upsetting. I am on Medicare so I don't have many choices. I would switch to Medtronic's closed loop pump, but unfortunately Medicare won't allow me to use the Medtronic cgm, so tandem is really my only choice.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? Maybe the best thing is for my story to go viral so Tandem knows I am not just another number and I am a person, a diabetic with feelings, and a person who doesn't deserve to be treated like they don't matter. \\n\\nThank you for reading all of this if you did. 🖤🖤🖤                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1299  My daughter was diagnosed with t1d 3 months ago today.  She just turned 5 and was 4 at dx.  She takes Humalog Jr. and her basal is Tresiba she also has a Dexcom G6  It has been a struggle.  I'm trying to follow all the guidelines I was given in the hospital, but I'm also trying to figure out some things on my own.  I'm really looking for some good advice or academic resources because I want to understand specifically how the body is working.  I don't feel like her treatment team is answering my questions, they sort of ignore my concerns and tell me to change her carb ratios.  Sorry for the super long post and at least one crazy question.\\n\\n1. How can I estimate or calculate the absorption of carbs into the bloodstream?  For example, I was taught if my daughter is below 80 to give 15g carbs and check again 15 minutes later.  That seems to spike her way up into the 300's and she won't come down even with a correction dose.  If I look at it from a purely numbers perspective, I see it as pouring 15000mg carbs into about 14dL of blood.  Giving me 1071mg/dL, which obviously isn't the case because she only spikes to the upper 300s.  However, I would like to be able to estimate how many carbs are going to end up in the blood stream so I can more accurately gauge what treating a low should look like.  I'm also just interested in the biological process.  I know this will be different for different foods, but when I treat a low I always end up giving her a high.\\n2. Related to number one, I'd like to know more about the process of digestion and absorption of carbs into the body and how long the process from eating to eliminating takes.  I've gotten my daughters pre-bolus down pretty well.  Her turn happens between 20-24 minutes post injection, a 10 minute pre-bolus will yield a relatively flat line, any longer and she'll go hypo before dinner can kick in, any shorter and she starts going high and it's like her body ignores the insulin.  Here is the issue, I can almost set my watch to when her Humalog loses effectiveness, appx 2 hours post meal she steadily goes up until she levels off in the 240-260 range.\\n3. She has been having really weird and unexplained lows, usually at night.  Can anyone tell me what causes these?  Three nights in a row, hours after dinner, so presumably her fast acting really isn't active anyone, she will drop dangerously low.  She eventually dropped down to 46 last night (41 on dex; 46 on finger stick).  When I gave her a juice box she was 71 on finger stick, 15 minutes later she was 46.  So I gave her another juice box and some fruit gummies, because I was terrified.  This sent her to 400 over the course of 2-3 hours.  I don't understand how she can crash so hard without being given insulin.\\n4. Lastly, I can't seem to find an answer on this one.  Does a t1d need carbs and insulin at every meal?  Sometimes my daughter just wants eggs and bacon or a plain hot dog cut up, but I make her have toast or fries because she needs her insulin.  Is this a valid thought process?  Basically everyone I've asked says \"that's a question for the doctor\", which sucks because we only see the nurses and NP right now.  I don't get to take her to see the doctor until the end of December.  I am not in any way trying to avoid carbs, I understand the important role carbs play in the body, I'm just not sure if a carb free meal here and there should be avoided.  It would be nice if I had a chart that said \"A 5 y/o girl who is active a lot needs 60 carbs per day\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1302  Hi all. First of all this is my first post here so I'd just like to say thank you. I've been reading so many posts from you all over the past 8 weeks. It's been helpful and insightful so thank you.\\n\\nI'll give you a little background to start with. \\n\\nMy 3 year old son was diagnosed with T1D about 8 weeks ago. We'd taken him to the Doctor due to a lack of any real appetite and lots of trips to the toilet for a wee. They did a quick urine test and found sugar. So onto the finger prick test and they found his blood sugar at 23 and sent us straight to hospital to get started with Insulin. Just like that my son was a diabetic. I'm sure you all know how the story goes....\\n\\nSince then we've been dosing him with 2.0U of Levamir every morning. And an insulin to carb ratio that has dropped considerably over this last 8 week period. We started with a 1U insulin to 15g of carbs. That was steadily increased and was sat at 1U to 35gc over the past 4 weeks. Im happy to go into more detail on the numbers if required anyway but I'll leave it at that for now. \\n\\nLast Wednesday, he started being sick uncontrollably, as if he'd picked up a stomach bug. This carried on for around an hour while we attempted to keep his blood sugars up through any means necessary. He ended up going to hospital with a blood sugar of 2.7 by the time we go there. Straight on a drip over the next 24 hours due to this severe hypo which we thought was brought on by his sickness. The more we have thought about it though, why would he drop so low so quickly? We were a little confused. \\n\\nWe got him home on the Thursday night and everything seemed to be getting back to normal but on the Sunday night he took another downward turn and started being sick again. Another bad hypo and a call for an ambulance. They ended up giving him a glocogen injection to increase his bloods enough to temporarily make him alert again. Again we wondered why he'd dropped so severely. Was his food just sitting in his stomach so the insulin was then just causing the hypo? On top of the sickness as well. \\n\\nThe next part of all of this is where it gets really weird. We've brought him home yesterday after 4 days in the hospital where he'd been back on the drip and managed to start eating enough for them to let him out. Since Sunday night though, we haven't given him Insulin at all. We've only given him 1.5u of Levamir which has now been dropped to 1.0u. His bloods have not been outside of a normal range since Sunday night when he had the last hypo. How is that happening? \\n\\nMy mind is doing overtime trying to work out what the hell is going on with my sons body. So many questions. Is he cured? Was he ever diabetic? Will it come back? Did he throw up his diabetes? Was it something else like a kidney infection and the diagnosis was completely wrong but the hospital stay has accidentally helped him cure whatever it is that was actually wrong with him? \\n\\nI'm over the moon my boy is back at home. But I'm a little Confused at the moment. If any of you lovely lovely people can help me and my family out with some experiences or advice then we'd be so grateful you've no idea. \\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read. These words are just a literal brain dump so apologies if some of it is confusing.

       "1337  I want to get some feedback on why I still chose not to use blood sugar sensors. Have they improved? If so, please let me know. I have been a diabetic since 2006, and I'm now 20 years old. I'm a 3rd year electric engineering student and have played tennis in college for 2 years.\\n\\n*Disclaimer: I used the Dexcom G6 a year ago, please let me know if they have since solved any of the following issues*\\n\\nAbout a year ago I tried the dexcom G6, and was overall disappointed with my experience, here's why:\\n\\n1.) Alarms that you can't turn off\\nI understand that the FDA mandates having an alarm for low blood sugar that can't be turned off, but I found that it made the dexcom system especially annoying to use. I was in a digital logic class, and my blood sugar went below the alarm threshold; it was about 50. So obviously I knew about it and was actively treating the low blood sugar with snacks, but the alarm kept going off periodically throughout the class about 3 times total within a 45 minute period). \\n\\nAre there better ways to manage this feature now? In my opinion, this feature alone makes the system not viable for a professional user (someone who has to attend meetings or college classes) because it disrupts everything and gets everyone's attention. My argument for having the option to eliminate this feature is that a manual blood sugar meter doesn't make sound at all - it doesn't even know what your blood sugar is unless you test it!\\n\\n2.) accuracy and delay\\nFrom my understanding, the blood sugar sensor doesn't measure blood sugar directly, it reads a from secondary source (present in the body) which is a good indicator of blood sugar. When I used the dexcom, the blood sugar readings would only update every 5-10 minutes, and they wouldn't be as accurate as a normal blood sugar meter. I believe this is a huge issue for treating lows, because that is where accuracy and delay become very important. A blood sugar difference of 50 and 70 means two completely different things as far as treatment goes. With a 50 I need to eat something immediately and with high sugar content. With a 70  can get away with making a piece of toast (will be more sustaining after my blood sugar has recovered).\\n\\n3.) Can you save data over a long period of time, on a smart device, and perform statistical analysis on that data? \\n\\nI study engineering, so, if I really wanted to I could take all my blood sugar readings, plug them into excel, and have excel run distributions, averages, peaks, etc. Why don't I? That takes way too much time. I think since Dexcom already takes the data for you, it should have the option to add measurements. For instance, you could say \"I want to know my average blood sugar over the last 2 weeks\" to siri or google assistant, and your phone should just be able to tell you based on the data from the dexcom app. If this isn't a possibility right now, I think a bunch of smart engineers would easily be able to figure it out. Engineers at Google are smart enough to track everyone's online profile and use it for ad tracking, they could easily take data that is already stored in the dexcom app, perform calculations on that data, and display it to a user. \\n\\nAnother application of this would be to display \"danger zones\", where blood sugars typical reach their maximum and minimum on a daily basis. So your phone would tell you: \"hey, based on data from the last month, 2 times a week you have low blood sugars around 3pm, consider lowering your dose for lunch\". I think this is achievable. Has anyone tried to log this autonomously using the current Dexcom system?

       "1394  I've been t1d for nearly 7 years, always had what my doctors call very good control (a1c under 7, usually around 6 since about a year after diagnosis). I'm on a pump and have dexcom g6 that I use constantly (and my parents follow my dex). Since I was diagnosed when i was already a very independent 12 year old, I took the lead on my diabetes management and have pretty much done everything myself for the last 7 years. My parents are there to support me, and my mom has helped me fight with insurance, deal with bad pump sites, bleeders, etc. They're incredibly helpful and my biggest supporters in everything. \\n\\nHowever my mom is really controlling. She has her own anxieties and issues, which she tends to project onto me. Basically she texts and bothers me constantly when my sugar is &gt;180, even though I don't need a reminder to deal with a high and we've discussed that. In high school it wasn't too bad, since I was home a lot and she could see that I was bolusing for the highs or changing my pump site out when I needed to. \\n\\nNow I'm a freshman in college, living in the dorms. I live 20 minutes from my parents (which I'm okay with, I like my school), so it's not as if they couldn't get to me if something happened--and my school is in a big city, 10 minutes away from my doctors and some amazing hospitals, so if anything serious happened I'm literally 10 minutes away from the nearest emergency care. \\n\\nwe talked about it before I left and agreed that when I'm low, I get a simple \"you ok?\" text from mom or dad (or both), and if I don't answer within 15 minutes they can call me to check in. When I'm over 200, we agreed that they could text me **once** after about an hour if my sugar isn't budging. \\n\\nMy mom totally does not go by this agreement and I'm furious. when I'm high, she texts me once, asking if I'm okay. Once I say yes, she gives it another 30 minutes before saying \"it's not budging?\", then continues to text me again and again every 30 minutes at least to ask whether I'm changing my site, if I'm handling it, what I'm doing, etc. \\n\\nI feel like diabetics understand that sometimes, you just get those stubborn-ass highs that don't go away no matter what you try!! And now that my stress levels are back up from hard classes, and it took me months to adjust to the dining hall diet, new sleep schedule, and new friends, those stubborn highs have been coming up more frequently. \\n\\nso yeah, I don't have straight lines on my dexcom anymore. whatever. I'm happier, my doctors have said multiple times that they have no concerns and I'm doing great, and my last a1c a couple months ago was 6. \\n\\nmy mom STILL won't leave me alone, even after I tell her how much it bothers me. When she constantly bugs me and asks what I'm doing about my sugars, it makes me feel like she thinks I'm incapable of handling things on my own, even though I've been doing it for years. I know she's coming from a place of genuine concern and worry, but it feel so hurtful. A few months ago she even asked if I was intentionally making my sugars high and not correcting them (It was a few times in one week that they were never over 350, and always came down within a few hours). I was so furious that I didn't even yell, I just sternly told her that I would never do something like that and was incredibly hurt that she thought something like that when I've been doing really well emotionally. \\n\\nSorry for this being long, she's texting me as I write this and it's infuriating. I do have a therapist and plan to bring this up w her next session, but I won't be seeing her for another week.\\n\\nTL;DR My mom constantly texts me when I'm over 200, won't leave me alone no matter how much I ask, and makes me feel like I'm not capable of handling my own diabetes. My a1c is 6 and my doctors are super happy with my current control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1462  M 55 y.o., 5' 10\", 168 lbs.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with type 1 some 44 years ago. I guess I have achieved \"Crafty Veteran\" status. ;-)  The treatment of diabetes was far different back in the mid70s.  The disposable needles were new to the scene.  The three types of insulin (L, R, and NPH) were taken from pigs and cows.  Blood monitors didn't exist.  Rather, there was this test tape you would have to pee on to see your approximate blood sugar level within the last 6 hours.  Unreliable.  There was one major sugar-free soda: Tab, which was pretty awful but I learned to love.  As a kid receiving a diagnosis the doctors and nurses approached it with unreasonable expectations.  \"No sugar ever. No birthday cake with friends, no ice cream in the summer, no s'mores at the campfire, no Halloween candy, no Trix and Cap'n Crunch, nothing. Ever. No!\"  They forced you into hiding your occasional Oreo birthday dalliances rather than help you deal with the blood sugars when they became raised.  The standard then was to count calories by using an \"exchange\" diet.  There would be a diet set up for you by a dietician who factored in your caloric needs based on age, growth rate, activity level, etc.  Every single day you would eat the same types of food in the same quantities because the types of insulin would be most effective this way.\\n\\nThe needles on the syringes were 27 gauge about four times as thick as the 31 gauge needles today.  The first consumer level blood monitor hit the market around 1977 and it wasn't easy.  You would be fortune to get a reading within 8 minutes.  The machine was quadruple the size of today's monitors so packing it to take with you was an ordeal.  It required calibration every time you turned it on, a two minute process.  You then had to do a trial run with a solution that had a preset level of sugar.  If the reading was within a specified range the machine was good to go.  After calibration and successful testing you inserted the test strip which required a HUGE drop of blood. Too little wouldn't work and you would have to toss the test strip.  By this time the machine would often shut off and you'd have to start from scratch.  After adding the big drop of blood to the test strip you had to rinse it after 30 seconds being careful not to do it early or wait too long.  Then, after another minute or so it would give you a reading.  Ugh!\\n\\nThe pig based insulin was scary.  The human DNA origin insulin of today is very user friendly.  That old stuff would cause reactions that were extreme.  It interfered with my ability to think, often causing incoherent actions, spasms, and a loss of verbal communication to the point that I only could speak two words: \"yes\" and \"no\".  The human insulin reactions are a walk in the park comparatively.  The reactions would slowly set in until it flipped an on/off switch in my thought processes.  During a severe reaction people would always ask questions but they were yes/no questions.  \"Are you okay?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you need help?\"  \"No!\"  The concerned people would gather around because they could tell something wasn't right.  I would get defensive because my brain was misfiring and because I was surrounded by a dozen unfamiliar faces all talking about me.  I only got kicking-people-away violent once but that's once too many.  I have been ejected out of stores and restaurants and classrooms until I could \"pull yourself together, man.  Why are you doing drugs and coming in here, dude?\"\\n\\nThe way things have progressed and advanced in the treatment of diabetes is quite remarkable.  Things are easier now.  My time anymore isn't overwhelmed with strict dieting and monitoring and freaking out about misinformation.  I have been told my whole life that a remedy for the condition is just around the corner, maybe even in a couple years.  I am still waiting patiently.  haha\\n\\nI handle my diabetes with Admelog and Basaglar pens.  I am an archaeologist by trade so I have no capability to use insulin pumps that can be crushed, lost, or yanked out deep in the jungle where disease is abundant and cleanliness is unexpected.  I do not get A1C readings more than once a year because I am on MediCal that doesn't support super attentiveness to health.  It's a program that endorses simple maintenance rather than aggressive proactive treatment.  My A1C readings have been in the 7 to 8 range and I am pleased with that.  I count carbs and adjust the insulin according to the quantity of food I eat which varies from day to day.  I am afforded enough test strips to test twice a day and I do well with it.  My kidneys and eyes are functioning like new.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1654  Background: I’m a fairly healthy guy. Tall and very lean, 6’4 and 175 pounds. I run  20k a week. \\n\\n\\nAs I am writing this up it is from a hospital bed in the intensive care unit. I took insulin for a nothing special meal (sandwich and veggies). Took the insulin on my way home so I was primed to eat when I walked in the door. 20 min later I am standing in front of the fridge and then ....NOTHING. I’m gone. I black out....I assume I then fell on my back on the concrete floor of my Kitchen. I passed out from a low blood sugar. Not a new story yes, we’ve all heard of this happening to people before. \\n\\nThe next parts are where it gets weird. \\n\\nI was completely unconscious with a blood sugar below the 40s according to my continuous Dexcom G6 .....for 6 hours. I woke up  at 3am the next day. When I woke up ....I couldn’t feel anything below my waist. I couldn’t move my legs. I was weak and barely conscious. I managed to eventually pull my body with only my arms to some fruit snacks downed 30g of carbs and just continued laying on my floor until  it kicked in. \\n\\nAt this point, I thought the legs thing was really weird but I’ll get control back I guess when my sugar is up. Right? No. Sugar was up 20 min later and I was still paralyzed. I was now going delirious from panic. Did a ‘Hey Siri Call...’ to my best friend to calm me down. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I didn’t know how to fix it. I was powerless. I was an athletic runner who couldn’t move his legs anymore. I was screaming in my head. \\n\\nHe calmed me down and got an ambulance to me. All my doors were locked so I dragged myself to the door with my arms to let them in. They got me to the ER.\\n\\nIt turns out I was suffering a combination of a swollen spine from compaction on a solid floor for 6 hours. The compression in my lower spine shut off innervation of my nerves into my legs. This 6 hours of compaction also compacted all the tissues in my body with contact to the solid ground. This lead to something called Rhabdomyolysis. \\n\\nThis is the extremely high accumulation of dead cells within the body. The typical person has anywhere between 50-250 u/ml at any time (A Calcium-Klinaise blood panel [CK]) just standing around doing nothing . Athletes can get up to maybe 1,000 u/ml after a strenuous workout. \\n\\nMine clocked in at 79,800 u/ml at the ER. They immediately began to   F L U S H  my body with saline. 400 ml of fluids every hour in the ER. Nuero comes in and tells me the situation, ending it with warning me that I may never walk again. This was all 5 days ago.\\n\\nI’m still alive. I can wiggle my toes now and have full control over everything but my ankles essentially. The rate of progress would suggest its only a matter of days or hours before I can work them fully. I mostly can now. But not entirely. \\n\\nBut it doesn’t end there! Remember at the beginning when I said I weigh 175 pounds? That was 5 days ago.  I now 264 pounds. I have a muffin top lol. I’m huge everywhere. My dick got so thick I now have a foreskin again. Turns out they overdid the saline treatment. By a lot. My CK is now in the normal range. My kidneys are above average health. I’m ready to leave. But they pumped so much fluids into me it’s effecting my mobility. My legs are so swollen I cant really move anything easily. \\n\\nThey admitted to over doing it so now they’re giving me some kind of water pill (diuretic) that will make me lose all of these fluids in 48 hours. \\n\\nUltimately, what I learned to respect from this is that lows are EXTREMELY dangerous. More than I think I took seriously. The cost could be death. Also extremely severe is what you go through if you’re lucky enough to live. \\n\\nTLDR; Severe Rhabdomyolysis from passing out from Hypoglycemia. It’s very very bad and the treatment is nearly just as bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1752  My ex gf of 1 day has diabetes. Prior to meeting her, I had never met anyone with diabetes, and didn't really know anything about it - in fact, I was one of those \"does that mean you can't eat sugar?\" people.\\nBut, it didn't take long, with some explaining by my ex, for me to get an understanding of what living with t1 diabetes meant.\\n\\nMy ex was sort of at a point in her life where she was trying to get things back on the right track, get away from the drugs and excessive partying, and try to be more responsible about her future. This was one thing I really appreciated about her, and I could tell she was doing a lot of it for me.\\n\\nBut there was one thing that always bothered me about her, and kind of had something to do with our eventual break-up, and that was how she handled her diabetes. Within the first week of us sleeping together, I experienced her having hypoglycemia, and having to run to the store to buy sugar, because I didn't have any food at home, and she was suddenly literally blind (that was the only time she said she lost vision.) However, her having hypoglycemia was a frequent occurrence.. like.. almost daily at some point. I would wake up to her alarm going off on her phone, and she wouldn't move for minutes, and remained sleeping. When I'd ask if her blood sugar levels were low, she'd deny it, either annoyed or in a baby voice. If I asked her to check, it would be low, and I'd have to try to get her to take her grape tablets. Well, in a perfect scenario, this is how it would go, but usually what would happen is she would refuse to check her blood, I'd spend 15 minutes convincing her to do it herself, or let me do it, and then spend another half hour pleading with her to take a grape sugar tablet or something.\\n\\nThings actually got better further into our relationship, but it was always on my mind that she wasn't doing enough to take care of her diabetes. I'd often wonder, at times when she was being especially playful or silly, if her blood sugar levels were off, and it was causing me a lot of stress. The biggest thing for me was that she hadn't gone to the doctor to try to get a cgm or something. Like, to me, I couldn't fathom why she wouldn't want a device that would relieve her from having to prick her fingers all day, and that would guard her from dropping into dangerous levels. It seemed like it would be a huge improvement in her quality of life, and it would help me not have to worry about her diabetes all the time.\\nBut she wasn't being proactive enough about it.. and I just couldn't understand, and it frustrated me. How can I be with someone who doesn't seem interested in having control of a lifelong condition that they have?\\n\\nSo in our last argument, I brought it up, and I said it had been bothering me for the longest time. She got very offended, and said I was being mean and selfish for telling her that her diabetes was a problem in the relationship. I told her it wasn't the diabetes, it was the way she was handling it, but she wasn't listening; she told me I didn't understand what it was like living with diabetes, and that hypoglycemia, and the unpredictable behavior that came with it, was something that would be with her forever, and it was unfair and cruel of me to use it against her.\\n\\nAnyway, I did some looking around on the web today, and tried to put myself in her shoes - because if I had t1, I'd definitely want a modern cgm and app combination with bells and whistles to minimize my stress and care. But.. unless I'm completely mistaken, the current cgms don't seem as modern as one would expect, and it looks like a lot of people on this sub still prick their fingers, and still have trouble controlling their glucose levels... And it's making me wonder if I was wrong all along, and that a gcm or something wouldn't actually have helped all that much, and that she wasn't being as irresponsible and careless as I thought :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1754  Ok long story short, I was flying from New Jersey to San Diego with United. When we went to board they said there was no over head space for our bags so they had to be checked. Fast forward to about an hour being on the plane I felt myself having high symptoms. I check my blood sugar and it reads \"HI\" that's it. So I know it's over 600 so I go for my bag under the seat and I can't find my insulin. I start to panic a little and I tell my brother. The guy sitting next to us mentioned that maybe they have insulin in the first aid kit. So I go up to the attendant and ask \" hey do you guys have any insulin?\" And she said yes. I was shocked honestly. She also said a doctor or nurse had to administrate it, when she said that I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I've been diabetic for 13 years, I can give administrate my own god damn insulin. So she gets the first aid kit, turns out there is no insulin in there. Great. The person in front of me happens to have some novolog pens and he so kindly gives me one. Now keep in mind those pens say \"single patient use only.\" So they are calling doctors on the ground to determine how much insulin they should give me even though I already told them how much I usually take in this situation. So they finally give me the ok to inject 10 units, literally after an hour of having the insulin available. Literally what I told them I usually do. They monitor me for a little and finally it's 580. So I'm like \"hey, can I take the pen?\" And they said the EMTs will have to decide. So I get off the plane and EMTs are waiting there, keep in mind, I'm completely fine. So I tell them I don't need any assistance but I would like to take the pen with me, considering it will be disposed of and unused. It's the same insulin I use so I didn't see the issue, plus I talked to the guy that have it to me and he said I could keep it. I also offered to pay the co pay of the pen in which he declined. The EMTs would not give me the ok and neither were the flight attendants. So I'm arguing with them back and forth and it was clear they were not going to give it back to me. So I left pissed off. Do I have a possible law suit? Or do I have the right to be upset? Please give me your thoughts on the situation. Thanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1819  Hi I’m new to reddit, and have never had a diabetes support network before. I’m hoping to find perspectives from other T1’s on coping  with and managing expectations around Diabetes care with family.\\n\\nI’ve had T1 for 15 yrs and am married to the kindest most loving and helpful husband. S.O is super great and supportive with T1. He understands it, we eat well, culturally diversely, and life is good. I will add that his parents are kind loving humans who treat me with respect and none of the discussion to come is due to ill intention on their part. Also We are an interracial family. I am culturally Indian and that is it’s own set of separate challenges.\\n\\nThe issues arise when with his parents who are a classic meat and potatoes American family. They eat relatively unhealthy per diabetes standards (lots of pasta, rice, cheese, meat, dairy, not enough non-starchy veg) and it’s been a challenge for me to speak up for my dietary needs. They don’t understand the effort diabetes takes and stress that comes with an unplanned food life. Mostly his dad isn’t interested in discussing food, no curious about my diabetes needs. They live in rural Maine where access to restaurants or other kinds of food is very limited, except for, you got it- classic burger/pizza joints. I have attempted to communicate my needs and assist with meal planning, even cooking meals for the whole family. I’ve tried bringing my own snacks along and requesting they stock the house with healthier snacks (not just crackers, cheese, pretzels, sausages). I feel uncomfortable asking them to adjust their way of life for me, but at the same time dread spending time with them when my FIL mocks my husband and I attempts to eat healthier/lower carb and more vegetarian, meal plan, or any thing else that makes eating with diabetes easier. \\n\\nIt is stressful enough to manage my dietary requirements on vacation (2-7days) away from home and it’s made worse when their habits are so health wise and culturally different and they don’t recognize or empathize the struggles I face. My MIL is responsible for the food in the family, and she tries to help (buys sugar free ice cream, or low sugar pie for example) but at the end of the day, they enjoy pasta and meat WITH bread on the side. I mostly suck it up and eat what is served, trying to avoid overloading the carbs. It hurts my feelings as if they don’t care enough about my dietary needs, and it extends to me feeling I am uncared for/unloved. \\n\\nIs it ok to request to eat separate meals? Or request they modify their diet a little for the few times a year we spend together? This situation is damaging my relationship with them and I am so bitter and resentful. My husband recently brought this up with his parents and they were extremely offended saying I was insulting the way they eat and their way of life. They didn’t at all validate or understand the challenges that come with living and eating with diabetes. It’s extra challenging because they are my in-laws, not my parents, and are not required to love me in the same way. \\n\\nHas anyone else experienced this? Feeling unsupported by family? How can I help my in laws understand and care about my diabetes when we are together? Any ideas would be great at this emotionally challenging time. \\n\\nLove!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1976  Hi,\\n\\nMy diabetes has been making me feel so wrecked recently. I am seeing my endocrinologist on Monday but my insulin wont work like it used to as of a week ago. I am taking double, sometimes triple, the needed dose to bring my blood glucose to where it needs to be. Ive tried different batches of insulin.\\n\\nI had to leave a friends birthday early tonight because I checked my blood glucose and it was randomly sky rocketing at 12.5mmol. I dont want to go through a night of high sugars because the way I feel now it will make me way too sick. And that gets me so down, the fact I have to leave events for things like this because of a sugar level that wants to randomly jump up. Its irritating because I measured my carbs, I took the correct insulin dose, I even took my long acting insulin, and this should definitely keep my sugar level stable, but no, it sky rockets.\\n\\nThis whole week ive just felt disgustingly nauseous and 'swollen' if that makes sense.   \\n\\n\\nSome may think of ketones, but ketones shouldnt affect the bodys ability to absorb insulin so how does it explain blood sugars that require almost three times the regular dose to come down?\\n\\nThe truth is I stupidly went on a keto diet (50g of carbs a day) without any professional medical advice beforehand. What I think happened is this:\\n\\nI reduced my carb intake dramatically to the point where I was taking 6 units a day TOTAL of fiasp for meals and 15 units of tresiba. Before keto, I was taking 6-12 units of fiasp PER MEAL, and 30 units of tresiba a night. I was on the reduced insulin for 2 weeks while doing a keto diet, and noticed my blood glucose going crazy when I had a cheat meal of a piece of naan bread with my food, 2 weeks into the diet. That is when I noticed my blood sugar would not go down when injecting the required amount of insulin I would usually need for this, resulting in me having to dose three times the usual amount, and now the same for each meal which has carbs in it. In turn, the large doses of insulin make me feel physically rough. \\n\\nI have only ever had this problem once in my life, and this was directly after a trip to Japan. I returned home and my insulin would not work properly. I saw my endocrinologist who was not sure why, but had changed my humalog to fiasp and the fiasp worked for me. Similarly to my situation now, when I returned that time from Japan I had eaten a lot of food, more than I would normally eat in a single meal in Japan, and this triggered my insulin to stop working for some reason.\\n\\nIt has just made me feel so sick this week and I had a trial shift for a new job today and was ready to quit but stuck through it (I got the job)\\n\\nJust wondering if any other t1 diabetics have gone through this, and what you think it might be. Sometimes my diabetes gets me down but I remember all the diabetics who don't have access to medical care and it reminds me to remain humble and count my blessings, but sometimes I just wish we could lift this weight off our shoulders. \\n\\nSome more info:  \\n\\n\\nWeight: 75KG\\n\\nHeight: 5' 8\\n\\nGender: Male\\n\\nAge: 29\\n\\nT1 Diabetes: 22 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2258  OK, this is gonna be a long one. \\n\\nUsually when I exercise, I tried to eat before my workouts and/or take bolus shot. I can manage my sugars with no insulin and/or food if it's a light exercising, but that's another story.\\n\\nNow I have moderate/high intensity workouts for about 2 hours later in the evening (when my insulin sensitivity is quite high). \\n\\nI am also now on a slight calorie deficit or maintaining daily amount, but surely try to avoid surplus/weight increase. That being said, I particularly cut the carbs, try to consume about 80g of carbs at most (that's including low's). \\n\\nWith this diet (I am used to it, have done it before) my glucose levels are quite stable and in the range (80-130mg/dl) through the day. Next, before I start my workout (warm up phase is about 30-40 minutes in 50-80% HR zones), my glucose is in the range of 110-125mg/dl. Plus, I have not consumed any carbs for at least last 3 hours before the workout. \\n\\nAfter the warm up (40 minutes) my glucose is already about 180mg/dl. So the question is: **how to deal with this (hoping to get some scientific info behind too)? And why it is increasing?**\\n\\nI pose these questions because usually if my glucose is in the range (80-130mg/dl), and I do light exercising (50-70% HR), it keeps dropping, and I need to eat something. So, ok, maybe in this case since I am in the 70-80% HR zone, and sometimes for short periods of time even above 80%, the glucose starts increasing, because I reach anaerobic state that requires more glucose for energy compared to low level exercising. Does it increase because I have not had any carbs for a while, and the body starts to consume stored reserves for energy? And since I have not had any bolus, the body delivers glucose to bloodstream, but it is not delivered because there is no insulin to deal with it? Does this sound right?\\n\\nBut now the next question: **If I take a bolus shot (2 units) some 40 minutes before the workout without any snack, will the glucose remain relatively stable (of course, it will not be perfect, but considering that timing is right etc.)? Or in this case because of the bolus shot, it will simply start to drop (=since bolus is injected, it keeps delivering glucose from blood to cells, and my sugar level drops. BUT (!!!) since there is insulin present that delivers glucose to cells, my body does not trigger release from the stored reserves, and I end up with a hypo???)?** \\- I am not sure about science behind this one. \\n\\nYes, I have a sensor, yes, I can take a time out and have a snack if my glucose drops, yes, I can also have a snack and shot before the workout regardless etc. But my goal is to cut some weight (necessary for sport), plus, ending up with a low is quite annoying because taking a snack complicates everything during my workouts. I also want too avoid snacking before/during workout, because it's more difficult to manage my glucose anyway in this case, and I may end up with a higher glucose reading than those 180mg/dl, and then again I have no energy, am out of breath soon, and my workout is shit. I hope to get some feedback based on experiences and/or scientific material to read that may explain this particular case in detail. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nP.S. After those 40 minutes of warm up when my sugar has increased to 180mg/dl, it starts dropping again (typical for me during long aerobic types of exercises), but still during this rise at first I feel that I lack energy at some point. So how to have energy without going LO/HI and avoiding eating carbs? If that is possible at all?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2337  Wondering, is there any research or information about manipulating the dosage of basal insulin?\\n\\nI know, many will say that I should not do that, but I am quite experienced with all the diabetes stuff and not afraid to try.\\n\\nOK. I do exercise a lot, I have cut my insulin dosages down to 30% of prescribed daily amounts (this has nothing to do with rationing, it's just my weird obsession of being healthy and avoid injections as much as possible). Since my workouts are very demanding, and I want to make very workout effective, I have started a new approach how to deal with managing glucose levels during the workout - taking large amounts of basal insulin **(I was originally prescribed 24 units, used to use 14 units due to my exercising and diet, now I use 30-40 units per day)**. \\n\\nWhy do I do this?\\n\\nI learned that higher amounts of basal insulin:\\n\\n* lower the glucose relatively rapidly (if the dosage is high),\\n* increase sensitivity towards rapid acting insulin (ok, maybe not sensitivity, just their interaction causes glucose to drop),\\n* in the long run through the day glucose levels drop after each meal, and I feel that cells receive energy even though at first glucose may be high\\*.\\n\\n\\*this is basically the main reason - with high dosages of basal insulin I can still perform well during my workouts even if my glucose level is quite high/higher, while with managing glucose with rapid insulin before/during workout is more complicated (those who exercise know what I am talking about - you can follow the same pattern, but glucose will be different any different day :( ). Besides, taking high basal dosages help me to sleep during the night - even if glucose is high (300), I d not need to wake up several times a night to go to bathroom; whereas, if I take my regular/decreased basal dosage and manage glucose level with rapid insulin, I must wake up and go to bathroom even if my glucose is only 130. I have had serious problems with sleep, and it is very important for me to have a rest; therefore, I gladly use this option. \\n\\nSo finally, the question: what are effects of this type of experimenting that I do? Does using very high dosages of basal can lead to some problems/complications in general (like increased insulin resistance and stuff)? Does the state when my glucose level is around, let's say, 300 while on a high dosage of basal affect my kidney's\\*\\*, liver, caterpillars, eyes, neural/nervous system etc?\\n\\n\\*\\*This part I find kinda hilarious, because, I mean, if the sugar is 300, then surely body wants to get rid of it, and that should be stress on all organs that deal with getting it out of the system, but then why I have no need to go to pee in this case?\\n\\nI tried to research, but did not find anything that could give any insight how mad/normal it is to do something like that? If someone can explain and state facts why this is really bad for my health, I can quit it immediately, but so far I do not see any reason to stop this experimenting. I can still manage my glucose with rapid insulin, but it is more inconvenient, and especially more difficult in the mornings when insulin resistance is higher (dawn effect or whatever etc.), and in general I feel weaker while on a high basal dosage I feel quite excellent. \\n\\nP.S. I know about dangers taking such high dosage before night, and hypo's that can occur, but I can manage that easily. \\n\\n**P.P.S. Disclaimer!!! I have type 1 for 22 years since my childhood, so I have a hold of this, but I highly do not recommend to follow this pattern to anyone here who does not have EXCELLENT understanding in managing diabetes, dieting, and others affects that can trigger high's or low's!!!**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "2363  I apologize in advance for the long post\\n\\nSome background:\\nLast A1C: 7.4\\nDiagnosed 9 years ago\\n17F\\nHave severe anxiety, have been on birth control for the past four months (I don’t know if these affect things)\\nI use the Medtronic 670g, with the sensor.  Humalog insulin.  \\n5’5 and 150 lbs (my weight rarely fluctuates, but recently I’ve dropped to about 146)\\nI eat a relatively healthy diet (minimal carbs, try to fill my plate with proteins and low carb fruits/veggies but I will have half a cup of brown rice or a slice of whole wheat bread regularly.  I also eat dairy)\\nVery active lifestyle\\n\\nSo I just finished a season of drum corps, and am starting marching band.  Both pretty physical activities (drum corps we spent upwards of 12 hours rehearsing in the sun each day). Towards the end of season (about two weeks ago) I began getting lightheaded/dizzy during rehearsals.  I would also get stomach cramps after eating and very nauseous throughout the day.  I had to go to urgent care for it, and after checking my out they found nothing wrong.  I’d checked my ketones, and they were never above 0.2 (I figured the trace amounts were just the burning of fat from the constant physical activity)  After getting back it seemed to have gotten better, but the first day of band, about an hour into rehearsal I got extremely nauseous and dizzy.  On my way to the nurse I ran into her and she told me that I was extremely pale and my lips were white.  My vision went blurry and o had to sit.  I was better after sitting down some time.  Of course, she pulled me out of band and said I needed to go to the doctor before coming back, so I did.\\nAt the time I went to the nurse my glucose was 169.  About two hours after, when I was at the doctors, my blood sugar had risen to 300.  Doctor took my blood, checked everything else and I seemed fine but have to wait for lab results.  I came home, checked my ketones and I was at 0.4 so I drank a ton of water and tried to flush them.  Later my blood sugar is 182 and my ketones are at 0.8.  Cue more insulin and water.  Then they drop to 0.3.  Blood sugar is still around 180.  About two hours later I check before bed and my blood sugars steadily rising to 200, and not responding to insulin corrections.  I check ketones and it’s 1.2.  Eventually I just decided to inject about six units of insulin (I’d been using my pump prior) and drink another bottle of water.  My blood sugar finally drops.  I wake up and it’s at 59.  But MY KETONES ARE STILL AT 0.7.  At this point I just said fuck it and went about my day.  I’m still very nauseous and dizzy, and while I was allowed back to band I had to sit out a lot.\\nThe doctor calls back, and apparently everything is completely fine (we have to ask for my A1C tomorrow cause they didn’t tell us) besides my high blood sugar.  I don’t know why I feel so sick still, and it’s extremely frustrating.  My blood sugar also is right back to 270 right as I wanted to sleep.  It was 190 before dinner (vegetarian sushi), and roughly below 150 the entire day before that.  I’ve tried calling my endo, but had to talk to a different one from the hospital who just gave the stock “drink water and give insulin” stuff and didn’t read into any of my other symptoms.  I’m hoping maybe other diabetics might recognize something??  This is very frustrating especially with my mother being the kind of person who just believes everything off the internet and keeps accusing me of not having good control or saying I have DKA or something (Pretty sure if I had DKA for two weeks straight, I’d be dead.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "2566  Hi! I’m looking for advice on longer term fasting/safely getting into ketosis. \\n\\nI’m in the US, so using freedom units. On my phone so please excuse autocorrect typos! Will edit with conversions and for grammar when I get to my computer later today.\\n\\nHistory and disclaimers before you yell at me: I’ve been type 1 for 4.5 years, and am a very research-driven person, so am trying to be careful and gather a sh*t ton of anecdotal + peer-reviewed tips before I do something stupid and hurt myself. I have a Dexcom G6 which is my greatest love in this world and keeps me sane and safe. I have pretty awesome control, especially recently as I get my mental health and other physical health issues under control (recent a1c of 5.7 with very few lows which is insane progress for me!) but as I exercise more, I’m finding myself having to lower my basal *and* still eat 75g of carbs with no bolus just to stay afloat sometimes. My endo and I have discussed that this could be solved by switching to a pump from MDI so I can suspend my basal as needed, but insurance problems are slowing this process down. And yes, I am in frequent contact with my endo and am going back to meet in person in 2 weeks, which is why I want to do my own research now so I can bring it to our next discussion!\\n\\nRight now, improvement with my bg numbers isn’t my primary goal as I am finally happy with where I am for the most part. I am interested in keto, though, as maybe if I switch to fat burning for fuel I will avoid the occasional necessity of eating so many carbs(?!). Anyone have experience with this as a T1d? I’ve read some about this but have specific questions if you’re willing to share: how long did it take to get into ketosis? How low did/does your blood sugar get before you get into ketosis? Have you gone low going into ketosis, and have you figured out how to avoid this?\\n\\nI have intermittent fasted in the past (20/4, OMAD) and am very interested in doing a longer fast (5+ days, and as diabetes allows of course) for the benefits of autophagy for other health issues. Has anyone done this? I have found a grand total of one peer reviewed study on T1Ds doing 24+ hour fasts, but I’d love to hear from you.\\n\\nI’ve reduced my basal so much at this point because of exercise I feel like I genuinely would need to stop using it to avoid hypos assuming I started fasting at a reasonable bg # (maybe 150+ ? Again I’m guesstimating based on previous experience with intermittent fasting.) I don’t want to stop my basal completely without doing a shit ton of research and talking with my endo of course. This seems crazy to me? I’ve historically been the person who struggles with highs more than lows, but now that I’m exercising a lot more I’m eating and eating carbs to just stay around 100. Suspending basal is normal, though, for you pump users right? So theoretically if I truly didn’t need insulin on a fast I could be okay? Or does this still put me at risk for DKA, even with in range blood sugars and with a proper and careful refeed to ensure blood sugars don’t spike while in ketosis? \\n\\nI guess this is a brain dump for me as much as it is asking for help. \\n\\nI’d love to hear \\na) your thoughts on the mess my brain has left above \\nb) your experience with t1d + keto and/or fasting of any type, and \\nc) if you feel the need to yell at me for considering getting rid of my basal please do but please back it up with sources because I’m having such a hard time finding them myself!\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you, and much love.

       "2662  Hey there fellow insulin addicts, I'm a longtime lurker and wanted to share my experience with looping. I'll break it down as simple as possible.\\n___________________________________________\\n**Devices**: iPhone X, Omnipod w/Riley Link, Dexcom G6\\n___________________________________________\\n**History**: I am an active 23 y/o and have had t1d for ~7 years now. I've always kept my bloodsugar somewhat under control having an A1C in the 7's. Not the best not the worst. I had an endo appointment before I started looping and had a nightmarish 7.9 A1C. Luckily for me, I had the riley link coming to my door step soon. (it takes over a month to get the riley link)\\n___________________________________________\\n**Setup**: The setup is the hardest part. You'll need to have a handle on scripting in the MacOS terminal (PM for help, I'm somewhat of a computer nerd), If you're a non-Mac user, the process gets even harder. You'll need to learn how to download and install the latest version of MacOS on a virtual machine (VM) to install the loop app on your iPhone (once again, feel free to PM me for help). You're going to run into errors and it's going to take way more time than you'd like to get this baby purring. \\n___________________________________________\\n**Immediate Thoughts on Looping**: If I had to rate the system, I'd give it a 5/5 any day of the week. I've been looping for over a month now and am almost always in the 90-120mg/dL range, its absolutely incredible. I've managed to get my A1C down to 6.4 in just one month.\\n\\nThe beauty of looping is that the software constantly has eyes on your bloodsugar and will increase/decrease basal rates accordingly. Like the omnipod, it will recommend bolus (looping bolus is more accurate than omnipod bolus though) to fix bloodsugar. An amazing feature of the loop app is having high and low boundaries, you can tell the app to keep you between 75mg/dL-120mg/dL and it does a fine job doing that. Possibly the most black magic part of the whole system, you'll need to find your insulin sensitivities ([link with guide on setting that up](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/settings/settings/#3rd-insulin-sensitivity-factor)). Insulin sensitity is the most important part of looping that can be overshadowed - it runs the whole show.\\n___________________________________________\\n**Final Thoughts**: To me, the worst part about being t1d is waking up to high or low bloodsugar and having to take care of it; inevitably, it will make you feel *off*. Since looping, I've been waking up to 100mg/dL every single day and never shooting up or down throughout my day. I feel incredible. I never go to bed wondering if I'm going to wake up in extreme ranges. I recommend this non-FDA approved system to anyone who wants to have their diabetes stablized and improved while putting in less effort than before. \\n___________________________________________\\n**Notable links**: [Loop Website](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/), [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup)\\n___________________________________________\\nThank you for you're time - please feel free to ask as many questions as you need.

       "2754  First, some context: I am a 27-year-old female T1 diabetic. I've had T1 since I was 2 years old, so essentially it is just part of my life. Current A1C is 6.8, am using a Medtronic PARADIGM™ 530G and Dexcom G6 CGM. Paradigm is now out of warranty, and conveniently failed at the beginning of the month, so I am currently on a Minimed loaner Paradigm.  \\n\\n\\nI guess this is more of a vent of dealing with Minimed and also looking for advice of how to deal with them in the future given my situation. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**First call to Minimed:** Unfortunately, my insurance United Healthcare is pals with Minimed and won't let me go for the t Slim x2 like I wanted. So I am stuck with upgrading with Minimed yet again. Since getting the loaner pump they have been blowing up my phone, texting me, calling me, emailing me, and CALLING MY MOM to upgrade my pump. This is while I'm looking at my options (surprise, Lol, United gives you none!) and maybe a week after receiving the loaner (you get a 3 month period with it before you get slapped with a charge). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI get back to them and the woman I'm working with says \"Oh by the way, your phone goes straight to voicemail.\" YES, because you've left me 2 messages today! Anyways... I give them my insurance info, they tell me they will check with my insurance to make sure the pump is covered, I say okay, and assume they will get back to me to let me know what is covered. Surprise again! I just get an email saying that I owe nothing (good) and that the pump in the shipping queue...So guess I am stuck with it. Fine, whatever. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Second call to Minimed:** I'm a little upset to see that the pump is in the shipping queue without them talking to me first and I just re-upped on Dexcom G6 supplies and Minimed wants to send the Guardian sensor to me either A.) When the warranty on the G6 runs out (3 months; the first associate wanted me to get back to them with the dates of expiration so they could send the Guardian out after), or according to this second call associate, B.) They want to pay me $200 to switch immediately and I would pay $100 out of pocket for the Guardian. This associate is pressing me to take option and saying they don't like to ship the pump and sensor separately. I convince him that to just send the pump and say I'll get back to them with the date of expiration because no way am I paying $100 for the Guardian after just paying $100 for the Dexcom refill. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The real issue:** I don't want the Guardian sensor, just the pump. I want to continue treatment with the Dexcom G6 which I have used since October and love. I have had the CGM Minimed put out with the Paradigm (little over 4 years ago) and absolutely hated it... Waking up in the middle of the night to deal with incorrect readings, calibrating constantly, the sensor kinking under my skin, the list goes on and on. I see that other people are STILL having these issues with the Guardian 3 and I don't trust it enough to relay info to the pump that will change my insulin rates. No thanks, don't want to be stuck with a subpar product for a year when I have the best luck with the G6. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHow do you convince MiniMed that you DO NOT want the Guardian sensor and will use the pump in its basic functions? I really just want an insulin pump. They can't force me to take the Guardian, right? Do I reaaaaallly have to go to training for the pump and CGM? Does anyone have positive experience with the Guardian sensor, or have had both the G6 and Guardian? \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n**Tl;dr** How do you deal with Minimed pressing you to get the Guardian sensor when you absolutely don't want it and are happy with the Dexcom and using the 670G pump? Does anyone have similar experiences?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "2846  I've had the last 3 go bad on me. One of them without ever warming up. I'm new to the G6, and after 4 years of G4 sensor perfection (never had one go bad in first 7 days), i'm a little discouraged.\\n\\nI've been a tSlim user for 2-3 months now, and really like the G6's near-perfect accuracy. the suspend function on the tSlim has kept me alive and sleeping very well. I love the system....when it works.\\n\\nThe last 3 sensors stopped without any notification. Just.....stopped. One minute I have a data stream, next time I look, nothing. Just a trend line gap. No notifications, no alarms, no notices of any kind. The CGM History just says \"Sensor Stopped\" and the time. Like i pressed the 'stop' button. One sensor lasted 4 days, another died during warm-up (that one did give me a 'failure' error), and this last one another 2 days. First 2 were in my arm, and was the first time i've put them there. the last one was in my stomach where I've been wearing the G6 for 2 months problem-free and used the G4 for 4 years without a hitch. I'd like to give the arm another try and rest my gut, but.....maybe not.\\n\\nThe situations where they failed have no commonality. Once out walking, once sitting reading to my kid before bedtime, and once out eating.\\n\\n2 different Lots.\\n\\nI do not use the Dexcom iPhone app. It's been on my phone, and occasionally hooked into the sensor, but my Bluetooth is usually off. That's because with the tSlim, i'm getting double notifications. There is no real gain to using the app, I'll just download the data manually. But it would lock onto it a few times a day, randomly. I do not think that cycle impacted this.\\n\\nI gently brush the applicator pad in Mastisol prior to insertion. But i'm careful to not get it around the wire or insertion site itself. there should be no impact or effect from it.\\n\\nFWIW, I tried to 'restart' them a variety of ways, even by putting my tSlim in a Faraday bag for a couple of hours. No use. the sensors were dead.\\n\\nThis is frustrating as shit. Dexcom agreed to send me new ones, but still, this is no way to manage care. I'm about to go back to the G5 and just use my phone. The suspend on the tSlim works great, but i'll just set alarms and wake myself (and my wife) up again. the endless cycle of calling customer support to get replacements filled is cumbersome and annoying. The G4 worked perfectly for 4 years (and up to 17 days at a time..). I cannot believe this is an improvement.\\n\\nI read the posts, and know I'm not alone with sensor failures. Reddit users are a small part of the overall T1 community, so I can only imagine the failure rate of these things. But still, 3 in a row? from different lots? The math makes it improbable. I feel like i'm doing something wrong.\\n\\nIf anyone has any history like this and identified an issue with the tSlim or G6 that i'm missing, please let me know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3047  Hey,\\n\\nContext: I'm a 23 y.o. T1D since 1998 (age 2), on Freestyle Libre CGM, injecting Fiasp at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and now since saturday Tresiba (new long-acting insuline, \"degludec\") around 10pm. Before that, I've used most of my life glargine long-acting insuline (Lantus), but had issues with it not lasting the promised 24 hours and thus having spikes at the end of the afternoon / before dinner so my endo recommended Tresiba, which is supposed to last around 40 hours while still taken daily (don't really know how they made it so the doses don't stack up, but that's irrelevant I guess).\\n\\nDoubt that's relevant, but I'm also currently taking 150-200mg a day of Alprazolam and Venlafaxine once a day, and had been before the switch to Tresiba with no change in my BS (except less \"stress spikes\").\\n\\nOther tidbit is that I'm living in France and this recent switch to Tresiba unfortunately coincides with the super heat wave we're having right now, so maybe that's related.\\n\\nMy problem is that I basically don't get how this new insulin works *at all*. My endo said the conversion Lantus to Tresiba should be roughly 1:1, but to err on the safe side at first.\\n\\nI have the 200u/ml pen version; since that was not super clear and neither my endo nor my pharmacist acknowledged that there exists 2 versions (100u/ml pens, like with Lantus, and this 200u/ml), when I first tested it on saturday I injected around half my usual Lantus dose (18), so 10 of Tresiba, just to be safe. It was a disaster and I massively spiked at the end of the night and had to correct in the morning. No other spikes during the day. So the next night, I tried with 14u, and had exactly the same results. Next night, tried 18u, and still, massive spike in the morning. Now I've read that dose adjustments with Tresiba may take up to 3 days to be fully effective, but I've already injected 18u for the last three days, and there's still absolutely no difference compared to the first day when I tried 10. My BS is relatively stable (around 120-150) before bed and till 4am, then spikes super quickly and I wake around 8 or 9am at 300-400! With Lantus, it was the opposite, as my BS used to go down a bit (~70-80) around 6-7am before dawn effect took over.\\n\\nIt feels like there's somewhat a long-acting insulin in effect during the day because other than correcting for the morning spike, I've had no need to adjust any other Fiasp dose during the day. Except I still have the same spikes at the end of the afternoon that I had with Lantus.\\n\\nBasically I'm completely lost. I have no idea why I spike like that during the night with this Tresiba, and going from 10u to 18u seemed to have no effect at all, neither with the morning spikes nor with the rest of the day. What's happening? Could the heat affect the insulin in the pen? (I keep my pens in my room once opened and not in the fridge, but never had any heat-related issue with any kind of insulin before. Is Tresiba more sensitive to heat?)\\n\\nHas anyone switched from Lantus to Tresiba and had similar issues?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3054  I just really need to rant to a community that understands this stress.\\n\\nI’ve had the g6 for 3 months. When I needed to do my first reorder of sensors they were on backorder and dexcom could not put in the request because they needed to do a pre-authorization. After only a month! They so graciously overnighted them once the authorization came in so I didn’t run out and I thought wow they’re great.\\n\\nMy second month of reordering came around and I wanted to call way ahead of time to make sure I would get them even with a backorder and the time it takes to ship (5-7 business days). They said they couldn’t put the order in yet so it would take another week. This would put me on my third sensor. As we all know sensors last 10 days. So by the time I can order I SHOULD get my sensors but there was a 10 day backorder... convenient. Again they so graciously decided to overnight me 1 free sensor and my month supply once the backorder was fixed.\\n\\nMy third month of reordering. I cannot get ahold of my representative. I called everyday for 5 days so I decided to call customer support. They tell me they’ve taken note of all of my calls (cool but they don’t call me back?) and then tell me they can’t reorder more sensors until my signed prescription is sent back to them form my doctor. I’m confused and frustrated because I had just given them a prescription 3 months ago. They don’t have that one on file... they have the prescription for the g5 (which I never bought because I couldn’t afford it) that was sent to them a year ago! Still confused I ask how they’ve been sending me supplies for a g6 when that prescription is for a g5 and they try to tell me it was written for both. \\n\\nWell I again ask for an overnight as soon as they get the prescription back. I called them and my doctors for 3 days before they receive it and to my surprise they’re on backorder. However, after they receive the prescription they tell me I still have one order left on my old prescription that they will send immediately (couldn’t have told me the first time?). I tell them along with this purchase I need a new transmitter. I notice in the invoice they didn’t put the transmitter in the order so I call my representative and again no answer so I call customer support. They tell me they need chartwork from my doctor of my blood sugars last month. I tell them I don’t have documentation of my blood sugar because I’ve been on the g6. They tell me no problem just have the dr notate that and it should be fine. So I’ve called the dr office everyday and they keep telling me they haven’t received it. \\n\\nI resort back to dexcom TODAY and they say they’ve sent the request on the 21st, 24th, and today. They also failed to mention but brought it up today that I need to have bloodwork done too in order to allow them to submit and order. Blood work of what?? I just had it done 3 months ago!\\n\\nSo I’m furious. I needed to change my sensor yesterday, so I do. I go to put in the sensor code and then it asked for my new transmitter code. Confused, I put in the same code of my old transmitter hoping it’ll work until I get the new one. Nope not the case. So now I have wasted $60 on a sensor, and who knows when I’ll get this transmitter. \\n\\nI finally contacted Costco and will be paying full price for a transmitter because dexcom fucking sucks. Luckily they have a rebate at the moment and the transmitter is almost have it’s normal price.\\n\\nrant over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3144  Hi reddit,  \\n\\n\\nI was diagnosed with t1 about 2 months ago. Been treating it with the help of a doctor and insulin with decent results (blood sugars down from 350+ during diagnosis around 70-120, working slowly towards the sweet spot of 83). Had some unpleasant lows on the way but hey its a learning process right.   \\n\\n\\nMy situation shortly: The 3rd world country where I live in has only one company for medical apparatus related  to diabetes, MedTronic. I am trialing their insulin pump 630G for about a week now and the thing is amazing. Every time I get to sit down for a meal and have to push a few buttons instead of injecting insulin manually I feel very happy. Nothing bad to say about the pump. However the constant blood glucose monitor from MedTronic (believe its called Guardian Connect? the one that works with the 630G anyway..) is a little bit less impressive. I like the \"suspend on low\"-feature a lot, just wish the monitor was a bit more accurate.   \\n\\n\\nMedTronic rep suggested I look into getting the newer 670G from my home country (about 10 hours flight away, I visit once or twice annually) as its a newer model and might be cheaper there - the country where I live in taxes diabetes apparatus highly. From what I understood there is also a better CGM from MedTronic out there using a newer sensor (Guardian 3, the one Im using with the 630G is the older model from I understood)? Wouldnt mind making the switch to that, if its better than the Guardian Connect/630G combo.\\n\\nANYWAYS! A few things I was hoping I could get answers to...  \\n\\n\\n1) Is it convenient to buy the newer version of the pump (670G) from my home country and use it where I live about 10 000 kms away? How often are you guys needing replacements for the pump, how often do they break down, etc? I do have support from MedTronic in the country where I live in now, as in spare parts etc, but if I needed a new pump in case the old 670G breaks down that would take time, I assume 2 weeks or so. MedTronic said they can give me a replacement pump if that happens (would be a 630G I assume), and that they can find a way to send the general spare parts needed for the pump and monitor (sensors, etc) to the country where I live in so that shouldnt be an issue.  \\n\\n\\n2) How much of an improvement is the Guardian 3-sensor from the CGM sensor that works together with the 630G? How much of an improvement is the 670G from the 630G? I read that 670G should be more automated and can increase basal if sugars look high which I like. Ive read some mixed reviews on reddit about the 670G though.  \\n\\n\\n3) Is it silly to buy a pump that has no support in the country I live in? For example my home country has Omnipod for sale but the country where I live in has 0 support for it, so Id have to fly 10 000 kilometres every time I want a new pump or more spare parts. Guess that doesnt work out? I wouldnt want to fly the distance more often than once every 6 months.  \\n\\n\\n4) How about using the 630G (or 670G) for pump but another CGM such as DexCom G6? How much am I missing out by not having the pump and the CGM work together, as in how much am I missing out by not having the system adjust basal automatically?   \\n\\n\\nIm not entirely sure if I can even buy a DexCom since in my home country (Finland) Omnipod and DexCom dont sell products to private patients directly and Im not entitled to healthcare in Finland anymor since Im not a resident. So Im not sure if a doctor would even treat me/assign the CGM for me even if I pay for it fully. But I could look into it. DexCom has no operations or support in the country I live in fwiw.   \\n\\n\\nInsurance is not a consideration, it will not pay anything for me in neither country. So I will pay for all costs for pump and CGM and spare parts.  Money is not an issue. I just want the best machines/the best combination of a pump+CGM I can get that is convenient for me. Ive been talking with the MedTronic reps about the logistics of pulling this thing off but I dont expect to get non-biased opinions from them-would be good to hear what reddit thinks. I think Im getting the hang of this diabetes thing pretty well, just a few things I could use help with. Thanks a lot in advance for replies :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3453  Just want to share my story because i feel like i can't share it with someone irl who understands. I got diagnosed diabetes type 1 in 2013 when i was 22. At first it was a shock and this shock made me change some of my habits. I read about alternative treatments such as changing your diet. I went vegan, ate mostly vegetables and raw, i ate about 100-150g carbs a day. My bloodsugar level was pretty good for a while and i was really confident. I survived with no insulin for a while until suddenly from one to the other day my blood sugar level didn't go down how it did before. So i started to take insulin again. Because my bsl was good i started to eat more carbs and i needed to take more insulin. \\n\\nIn 2015 i left to travel asia/europe with my ex-girlfriend. At that time i was used to take insulin before every meal and take the basis insulin daily. Confronted with strangers almost every day, getting invited for lunch/dinner etc. or just having a drink made me to be not so so consequent with taking the insulin. At first i thought it's ok and it was ok for a while. But it wasn't. I didn't want to explain myself everytime when i have lunch or dinner with someone new. I didn't accept the fact that i have diabetes and that i'm bound to chemicals for the rest of my life, i realised that only later. And i'm still not sure if i accepted it 100%. Everytime i did something 'bad' for my diabetes i thought 'no worries, you gonna change these habbits sooner or later'. \\n\\nIt's strange, diabetes, it's always here but you never really see it, it's like a ghost, you know there is something but only numbers tell you it's real. I was travelling for about one and a half year. The last 7/6 months i travelled alone, and more than once i rewarded my self with sweets (which i would never ate before diabetes) because i thought now that i'm alone and nobody sees it it doesn't count. But it did. When i arrived back home my first week i spent in the hospital because of a Ketoacidosis. That was in fall 2017. Then i thought ok now i have to change. \\n\\nI did for a while. But then 2018 came, summer came and i got accepted for art school. I was checking my hba1c regularly and it was never really good (around 10/11). I kept telling me i will change my habits and start to have a healthier life style soon. I dont't talk about my bad levels with other people because i feel it will disconnect me from society, or from social activities. \\n\\nI'm a student now, i sit a lot. I go out a lot, drink a lot (mostly beer). There are less days in the week where i don't drink. I take drugs at parties and come home early in the mornings or afternoons. I don't have regular meal times, sometimes i eat after midnight when i come home, sometimes i eat almost nothing the whole day, sometimes i'm just snacking. My blood sugar levels are a mess and i need a lot of insulin. I don't count carbs or anything, i just inject what i think is necessary. Mostly i'm wrong. I haven't been to the doctor to check my hba1c lately cause i moved city. Most people from my surroundings tend to drink a lot (art students) and i think alcohol is more or less a big problem in having diabetes under control. When i'm drunk i care less. I was thinking about quitting alcohol but change to other substances like lsd (micro dosing or so). I don't know if it would be a good idea. \\n\\nIt's pretty clear what i should change. But it's not easy. It makes me sad, makes me feeling helpless and i still pretend everything is fine. Since a few months i have a small round spot in my sight. It's getting a little bigger lately. I'm observing it. I don't want to get blind. It creeps me out. I only talked to one of my friends about it. I don't want to be the 'special case', i just want to enjoy life like everyone else is doing around me. But i can't. I pretend i do enjoy but everytime i consume something, food, drinks etc. i feel guilty. It's a feeling which came with the diagnosis of type 1.. \\n\\ni don't know what i expect on sharing this here but maybe it feels good to write it. sorry for my english, it's not my native tongue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "3679  Hey guys, I’ve been debating making this post for a few weeks now. This is a throwaway account since my SO might also be subscribed and I just want advice on how I could address this before I work up the courage to talk to them.    I don’t want to worry them by being a worrywart myself and hovering. They’ve been so pleasantly surprised every time they’ve caught me educating myself on type 1. I bought a book not long after we started dating and they ‘caught’ me taking notes; they were scrolling through my reddit (I had no problem with this) recently and were surprised to see I was subscribed to r/diabetes. I love them very much and want to do what I can to support them, to encourage a healthy diet and active-enough lifestyle, to cheer them on, to know what to do if they’re ever in need of medical attention.    I’m beginning to secretly *really* worry they may be in a slump as far as keeping their blood sugar below the “high” threshold they’ve got on their pump. Circumstances involving their future career have seemed to have gotten them very down, and they tend to keep everything that’s bothering them just bottled up until they’re ready to burst. I’m afraid to pry because of my own insecurities, worried (irrationally) that I’ll have gone too far and prodded too much and just drive them away. Also I’m worried that my worrying will just make them feel even worse. I’m scared I’m too nosey about it. But I perk up instantly when their pump vibrates that their BG is too high. And I feel ashamed but I peek when they pull it out to bolus, and I keep seeing it in the 300s (mg/dL). I’m so worried. I know it’s not as bad as being too low but it’s still bad, and I don’t know how to address it. They were diagnosed over two years ago and it pains me to have educated myself on all of this and still be tentative about *knowing what exactly* is going on.    Don’t you feel physically terrible when your BG is higher than 200? They seem ok; they’re not doing jumping jacks obviously but they don’t let it stop them from spending time with me and being happy. They’ve gained some weight in recent months, and I’ve chalked it up to stress and to them just trying to keep up with me and be “normal.” They love their fast food and their candy, they get excited to share and binge with me. And as much as I enjoy eating junk food (and for the most part can get away with it, with my metabolism being what it is and my job being rather physically strenuous) I *really* want to have better habits so that we can get into a groove together. I’ve been gently shot down the few times I’ve suggested it, and like I said before: my insecurities about overstepping boundaries keep me from just bringing it up. I’ve tentatively asked how their blood sugar has been, hoping they know I mean how they’ve been doing and how it’s been going because they do seem to be very alone in that regard. I’m not aware of their receiving any support online and they don’t see their endo very often. But when I’ve tried to casually bring up their BG, they’ve answered so shortly and carelessly that I’ve worried I’ve annoyed them by being nosey. I’ve resigned to just not bringing it up at all now, and I cringe internally when I see them gorge on candies and not pull out their pump once.    Here in the last week they’ve started kind of ignoring me when I wake them when their pump buzzes too. I know they’re sleepy and maybe I just don’t fully wake them, but my silly insecurities get the best of me yet again and I’m afraid they’re getting very tired of me insisting they check their pump and bolus in the middle of the night when it’s woken me up. I’m never annoyed by it by any means. Like I’ve said countless times...I just worry.    What would you do, if your SO expressed worry about your levels? Do you talk about it openly? I’ve even showed them funny t1d memes and I’ve gotten mixed reactions that have made me so sad... I just want to make it normal, because it’s a part of their life and it’s never going away, and it sucks and I just want to be here for them. But I’m so uncertain.    Thanks for any input, sorry this is so long and especially sorry if this isn’t really appropriate. I just want to understand and to show them their wellbeing means a lot to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3724  I wanted to share this story because it just happened today and I don’t know if any type 1s have experienced this. \\n\\nI work at a small-town hardware store and we get a lot of elderly people who come in. I got to work around 11 after going to my endo appointment. I was watching the register while another coworker was at lunch, and we were pretty slow during this time so there were maybe three people in the store. I rang an older couple out, they took their things and walked out. Once they left, an older gentleman walked by the register and was sort of grunting and walking a bit funny. I kept my eye on him as he left but once he reached the door I had another customer come up to the counter. I start ringing them out and the couple that I had checked out a minute ago come back in and tell me the gentleman had collapsed in the parking lot. I paged for another coworker to come up front and help me out, so we both go outside and see this guy on his back, kind of rolling around. I took my sweatshirt off and put it under his head. We try asking a couple questions but he isn’t responding so I called 911. I didn’t see any bleeding but he looked very pale- a familiar kind of pale. I had a feeling in my gut he was diabetic, but when I asked he didn’t respond. Where I live, the fire department is literally across the street from the store. I stayed on the phone with dispatch for a while as she asked me questions, and finally hung up once she told me they were on the way. We wait another 3 minutes or so until they arrive. Once they get there they start asking questions, and one question they asked was if he was a diabetic, to which he said finally said yes. They check his sugar and it was at 21. Once they said that my jaw dropped and I froze. They got him up on the gurney and took him into the ambulance. Once my coworker and I went inside I immediately started crying uncontrollably and headed for the bathroom. I felt like I was looking at my future and it was terrifying. I tried to pull myself together but I had to leave work for the day because I was so distraught. I’ve never witnessed another diabetic so critically low before. They asked him if he gave himself insulin and he said yes, and then they asked if he ate anything and he said he didn’t know. It made me think about growing old and being in situations like this. I could have my diabetes under control but you can’t fight old age and it really scared me. My coworker texted me and told me the gentleman was okay, and that he drove home after about 30-45 minutes in the ambulance. I just needed to get this off my chest because it’s been bothering me all day and I didn’t know if anyone else has had experiences like this. It was just overwhelming and hit me hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3780  Just a piece of background info: Along with T1D I also have ankylosing spondylitis and am on Humira, an immunosuppressant for it which makes me more susceptible to infections, I’ve had about two a year since I started it.\\n\\nSo I changed my pump (omnipod) on Sunday/Monday and it was kind of irritated, not unusual, it was in for the whole three days when my doc has me prescribed for two because my body tends to reject them early. Few days later it’s more irritated and showing some signs of infection. Wednesday it was even worse so I went to urgent care. They said they were glad I came in when I did, lanced it to add a gauze to help drain it and got me an rx for antibiotics. \\n\\nThe next day it was worse and I was dizzy and nauseas, went back to urgent care who then sent me to the ER because they were worried about sepsis at this point. I contacted my rheumatologist to clarify I should cease taking my immunosuppressant and ask how I should handle it. She got back to me with instructions, she has always allowed me to be a participant in my own care and has trusted my judgement when my care would also affect my diabetes.\\n\\nAt the hospital, all is good in the ER, no one concerned about my pump although I had to explain, the infusion site became infected after I removed it and that my pump was not still at the infection site. \\n\\nOnce I was admitted I had to repeatedly clarify to the nurse what an insulin pump does vs a cgm. This continued the entire time. I also had to spell Ankylosing Spondylitis for her multiple times and clarify that just putting spondylosis as the diagnosis was not sufficient because AS is autoimmune and general spondylosis doesn’t automatically mean that. \\n\\nLuckily they let me keep my insulin pump and just keep a log (that nobody looked at because none of the nurses understood diabetes or insulin pumps) but, again, I had to clarify multiple times that no, my pump was not still at the infection site. I made it clear there was nothing wrong with my pump, my infusion sites, ect. And this was an issue because I am immunosuppressed. \\n\\nWhen I saw the doc he kind of questioned me more than necessary on my AS diagnosis because I’m a girl, more men are diagnosed with AS, and because my diagnosis wasn’t confirmed by radiology or gene testing. Kind of annoying, but I am used to my diabetes being the scapegoat of all my problems so I was just happy he was focusing on the disease that actually caused the issue and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just interested.\\n\\nYesterday, while waiting 7 hours to be discharged they sent in a diabetes educator, without informing me beforehand. She woke me up and started grilling me. She was trying to make this an issue about how I manage my insulin pump. She tried to insist there was some problem with how I use my pump to explain the infection, trying to suggest things like I need to use skin tac wipes, which I have had reactions to. She didn’t ask me what I thought happened or how I manage my pump. I have been on a pump for 12 years. I just felt blindsided, I just reaffirmed there were no issues with my pump and that it was my immunosuppressant and I’ve already been in contact with my rheum.\\n\\nI will say I’m lucky that my endo is also type one so he has always understood and has always respected the fact that I am the expert on my own individual experience with diabetes.  It’s just annoying when you have people who know very little trying to lecture you because you’re in the hospital for a tangently related issue.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Was in the hospital for an infection from my infusion site because I am immunosuppressed to treat my ankylosing spondylitis, nurses didn’t know the difference between a pump and a cgm and they surprised me with a diabetes educator trying to blame my pump management for the infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "3852  At first sorry for my english. I am from Austria and I do my best. I am also on my phone so sorry about the formatting.\\n\\nA few things about me: I am 19 years old and I suffer from diabetes t1 for 15 years. I have a pump since I was 10 I guess. At fist I had a medtronic pump but I  got a ypsomed pump last year bc it's not that big and you can connect it to your phone and other benefits. I use a steel catheter since the plastic ones always bend (???) hence I always had a leaking catheter and my bloodsugar was high. But the steel ones are great, I don't feel them in my body and my blood sugar is great since then.\\n\\nNow about the little fuck up. Last Friday I was in Vienna and got really hungry so I ordered fast food and ate it. Me being a dumb, lazy idiot, I forgot to inject the insulin. So after an hour I felt that my blood sugar was high and I corrected my mistake. After half an hour I felt it was still pretty high (don't worry I also checked my blood sugar level) and I injected another dosis of insulin. But nothing changed. I thought it was normal since I ate a lot and normally my body needs to \"calm down\" after being on a high glucose level. Later me and my gf decided to go and get some food so I drove to the mall and bevor I went into the restaurant I checked my blood sugar which is still high af. I know I should have considered it before but now was the time I had to change the catheter. I was angry bc I rarely need that long to get a decent glucose level. I put a new catheter in  and removed the old one.\\nI almost got a heart attack bc the plastic on the catheter was fine but the 9 mm needle wasn't attached to the plastic anymore. I pressed on the part of my body where the catheter originally was and I felt an unpleasant pain. I still had no panic since my gf was next to me but if she wasn't here I would have screamed and cried bc I was so scared. So I drove to the hospital and they tried to pull this 9 mm thing out of my body. They cut a piece of my skin out, searched for it and finally after 20 minutes they managed to show me the needle.\\n\\nNow I am sitting here, one week later with a healing scar and praying that I never ever have to experience this shit  again. I guess it was a production problem but it still scares me to think about that this could happen again.\\n\\nAgain sorry for my English I just wanted to tell you about this situation and I can't give you any advice. Just take care of yourself and check your catheters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "3881  It was suggested of me to cross post this here. I originally posted it in the bjj forum since I'm a grappler and type 1 since the age of 6 years old, and I'm currently turning 38 this weekend. Going to pasta my post now -\\n\\nIn threads in the past I have had conversations with members about CGMs and how the pump, etc was not an option for me as I cant keep a sensor or port in to save my life. They always pulled out, no matter how well I wrapped and taped them to my body, so I gave up and did it the old fashioned way. Finger sticks and shots. \\n\\nLast week I got the Eversense CGM implant and it is the real deal. They implant a sensor, in the form of a capsule/chip under the skin and then place the transmittor on the skin which sends the readings to an app on my phone. Best part is that I can slap a new adhesive on after training everyday and it wont break the bank the way a traditional CGM would as insurance only covers one sensor per week. They give 100 adhesive patches per 3 month period and buying more patches isnt very costly at all.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis is seriously one of the best things to happen for active diabetics, especially those of us who grapple. I have been training for many years, and this has been a godsend for me. When I train, I take the transmitter off, when I'm done training, I put it right back on. Easy as that for a cgm. I don't have to worry about covering anything when training or fear people grabbing it when they grab my gi etc\\n\\nI know Im leaving some detailed shit out but go research it and see if your insurance will cover it.\\n\\nThe insurance plan I have through my wife covers the sensor, however I am in a different state at the time so my the had to contract with a local BCBS plan that unfortunately, doesnt cover the system. Luckily the Eversense has a bridge program that cuts the costs down TREMENDOUSLY to only about $99 for a three month insertion, and you get three insertions for a total of $300 for 9 months of CGM. During that time they can try to help you get it covered and theyll work your insurance I believe.\\n\\nA plus is that one of the reps has trained BJJ, so they understand what its like to deal with this shit. Customer service has been great with them and they are calling to check up on me daily to answer any questions or to see if Im having any issues. \\n\\n Im not getting paid, nor do I work for or affiliate with the company, but as I said this is a big deal for me and my care. Hopefully it can help someone else out who is in the same place I have been in for the past 12+ years when it comes to bjj and grappling.\\n\\nIve been type 1 since I was about 6 years old, I normally test between 6-12x per day, and today I only poked my fingers 2x for the daily calibration.\\n\\nhttps://www.eversensediabetes.com/patient-education/\\n\\nAccessories-\\n\\ngrifgrips.com  diastuff.de                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3906  Am I alone in feeling like I am being held hostage by the doctors? I don’t need to see a doctor. Nothing is wrong. Nothing has changed. They are going to say the exact same things they have always said. Even the A1c is going to come back the same or extremely similar. But they won’t renew my rx unless they get their $70 co-pay every month. Seriously. If feels like my life in exchange for my money. I am being held hostage at syringe point. \\n\\nIf it was a random person on the street threatening to choke me to death and deny me the air I need to breathe in exchange for money I would be screaming for police and justice. But it’s a doctor and this is a medical condition so it must be ok for them to do this right?\\n\\nBut I don’t want a doctor controlling my life for the rest of my life. I don’t want doctors telling me to get more exercise, drink more water, control my stress levels, get more sleep, and otherwise just be god damn well perfect all the fucking time. Test more. Eat less carbs. Yak yak yak the fucking know it all, perfect life, no stress, fucking doctors who apparently forget I don’t live in a vacuum and life happens no matter what. And it ends no matter what. I try. I do my best. \\n\\nBut my toddler has no idea why mommy suddenly gets angry and has to stop and eat and can’t play for the next hour while I try to recover and stabilize. So I’ve had my targets a bit higher than normal so I don’t scream at my toddler to leave me alone so I can focus on finding the skittles and not having a seizure and finding the phone to call someone in case I suddenly need an ambulance. And that I am trading my long term health so my toddler doesn’t need therapy for the rest of her life bc mommy seems to be totally bipolar. And instead of listening to me, and trying to help, I’m told to do better and balance my activity and food and stress better. Bc that’s really helpful. \\n\\nI just need someone to tell me that it is ok. That I am not a shitty mom. That my toddler is going to survive my lows and it’s going to be worth it to keep putting up with this diabetic shit day in and day out for the rest of my life. \\n\\nI’m just having a super shitty day and need some support. Bc when your toddler hugs you while you have an anxiety attack saying ‘mommy feel better’... ladies and gents I feel like shit right now. It was the sweetest thing ever. And all I want to do is go crawl in a hole and cry so she doesn’t see me crying and doesn’t see how sad mommy gets bc of this diabetic shit. And my little girl shouldn’t have to be careful where she touches me bc of my pump and infusion site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3983  I've been having problems with Omnipod for several months. It's so bad that I'm trying to switch to T:Slim.\\n\\nBut I have been able to improve things and I want to explain how I do it just in case it helps some one else.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, use an area that has lots of fat.\\n\\nSecond, look for veins. They appear blue/green and you must keep the infusion catheter from hitting them.\\n\\nThird, rotate your locations as much as possible. For me there are only two places I can wear a pod successfully: my left and right abdominal fat roll. Anywhere else ends in tears / high blood sugar.\\n\\nDo not overfill the Omnipod. No more than 200 Units, even though it can take a bit more.\\n\\nIf possible, allow the insulin to warm to room temperature before filling it. If I have to do an emergency change, I warm the insulin bottle with both hands.\\n\\nDo not take off the cap until after priming is done.\\n\\nGently flick the insulin in the \"insertion window\" out of the pod after priming and removing the cap.\\n\\nPeel one of the bottom stickers part way, then pull the other sticker off the whole way, then pull the first off the rest of the way.\\n\\nPlace the pod on the body. Avoid getting too close to the belly button.\\n\\nTake a picture, or closely examine the \"injection window.\" Note the inner shape of the plastic and how much insulin is stuck to it.\\n\\nWith one hand pinch the roll of fat under the pod as deep as possible. The goal is to bring up the pod without causing tension on the skin it is attached to. In other words, bring up the skin, but don't pinch it.\\n\\nWith the other hand start the pod and then immediately press down on the pod so that is is pushed gently into the skin. I try to make the skin look flat instead of bubbled at the top.\\n\\nThere is a random amount of time after you hear the pump clicking before you hear the snap of the cannula being inserted.\\n\\nNote the amount of pain you felt. Pain is not necessarily a bad thing, but can sometimes indicate that you struck a vein.\\n\\nLook at the top of the pod and make sure the little thin area window shows pink. (I've never had that fail).\\n\\nLook at or take a picture of the insertion window and make sure the cannula is properly entering your skin.\\n\\nTake your first bolus. I always change out before breakfast so I take around 10  units with my cereal.\\n\\nAfter the pump is done clicking, take another picture of your insertion window and note if the shape of the liquid in the plastic has changed, if there are more or less bubbles of insulin, or literally any change at all. If anything is significantly different, the insulin may not be going into you.\\n\\nAlso, have someone who cares give it the sniff test. The amount of insulin will be very little and the amount of smell associated with a well installed pod will be learnable. Your family / friends will be able to tell you if the smell is too strong because the insulin is leaking under the pod into the adhesive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3984  thanks to the continual improvement of technology and the growth of knowledge via research I have been able to evade natural selection. having been diagnosed 37 years ago I have been through many stages of engagement in my own health. acceptance, resistance, denial, success, failure. I have seen many technologies come and go and I have relied on the grace of other who care for me, I have benefitted from the intellect and dedication of scientists, doctors, and educators. Diabetes was once a death sentence, thankfully that is no longer the case. this time in history is the best time to be a diabetic, CGMs, pumps, different types of insulin all make our lives easier and our control tighter and less stressful. I try hard to be grateful for the good thing surrounding this genetic hand I've been dealt. for a long time I lived as if tomorrow was uncertain, and in a large part I still feel that way, but I approach the ramifications of that idea differently. in my 20's this idea of cheating death made me feel fragile so I engaged in risky behavior, made bad decisions, and turned my back not he hard work others had done for  and with me to keep me alive. I have regrets about those bad decisions because they have boomeranged back to me, affecting my eyesight and feet. I can't take those choices back and I won't live with regret about them. I will confront the consequences and move forward. I have never ask for sympathy and I don't find it productive. I don't get angry when someone who doesn't know about my disease makes a comment about sugar, tells me \"you can't eat that\", or doesn't know that their grandma's type II is far different than my type I. In a moment like that I try to educate and grow awareness. I don't understand why there is a comorbidity of diabetes and depression but I live it, I feel it, I battle it every day. this is a heavy weight we all have to bear. I carry guilt for fighting my mother when she tried to deliver an injection to me at 6 years old, I feel angry at myself for keeping my wife up at night when I have an urgent low. but I also feel a sense of pride that I wake up everyday, that even though I have, in the past chosen not to fight, I wake up and face this disease head on. I have grown. I fight and I try and I do what I have to to stay alive. it's not easy for me right now and I want to say to all of my fellow type I soldiers, you can do this. you can fight another day. it's gonna hurt, you are going to cry, you are going to over bolus, over eat, forget to test, ignore your beeping CGM, but you're also gonna see a better A1C, your gonna eat an awesome meal that doesn't send you running for the keto sticks. I don't know what the hell I just wrote but as much as I am trying to convince you its gonna be ok I am trying twice as hard to convince myself.  I am currently searching for a reason to feel grateful to be upright today. we are beating natural selection and thats weird because it makes me feel proud and it also makes me feel like I don't really belong on this side of the dirt...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "4008  So I was diagnosed February 2018 and I just wanted a place to share how I got diagnosed.\\n\\n\\nSo their were no signs at first we had no idea that I was diabetic so when I started getting symptoms we had all assumed that it was the flu I was throwing up everything that I ate and I felt sick all the time focusing was impossible I didn't even want to watch YouTube or read.\\n\\nWe were really confused because my temp wasn't high or anything but it was obvious that I was doing had so I stayed home and slept all day barely eating anything cause throwing up isn't fun and since we didn't know what was wrong they were giving me sprite smoothies and ice cream to help (it didn't).\\n\\nWe went to Care now and they also thought it was the flu so we were just told to wait it out and given advice then I started always drinking water I had quite a bit before but now I was always thirsty and I always had to piss which sucked cause I didn't want to move I remember waking up in the middle of the night trying to drink from my 36oz cup of water and literally just crying if I didn't have any cause I felt like shit and didn't want to go down the stairs\\n\\nThis continued for 1-2 weeks and I wasn't improving and my parents were worried cause I hadn't gotten sick in 6-7 years before this (idk good genes?) But other than being thirsty and pissing a lot throwing up wasn't to crazy for the flu and not wanting to eat (I starved myself those weeks and ate almost nothing I was getting THIN) so they didn't take me to a hospital or anything.\\n\\nAnd then I started hallucinating and my mom said NOPE I was so bad that I was legit seeing things and didn't even know we were at our house (kept saying I wanted to go home (scared the shit out of my grandmother who's a nurse and hears that from dying patients)) my mom literally drags me from my room cause I insist that I'm fine and just want to lay down and drives me up to Care now where they (I assume) check my blood sugar  (around 500-600 cause I hadn't been eating and I was still pumping out a bit of insulin) and next thing I know I'm in an ambulance where I sleep cause I don't want to exist deal with anything (headache hungry tired thirsty) \\n\\n\\nThen I'm in the hospital and I don't remember why but I wasn't aloud to eat for 24 hours (was at cook children's btw great people 10/10 never wanna go again) didn't even give me water (I hated it) just ice chips I was hungry from starving myself pissed cause the other patients never shut up so I could sleep the bed was uncomfortable cause I didn't have my own room and I hadn't eaten for 1-2 weeks \\n\\nThings did get better though and after the 24 hours I got my first meal that I didn't throw up in 2 weeks scrambled eggs sausage (ordered bacon But they didn't gimme t-t) milk and fruit loops.\\n\\nI did hallucinate a bit more in the hospital some a bit more obvious than the others in order I SAW a spider hanging from the ceiling that scared the shit out of me when I thought that it disappeared cause it fell in my covers, a light show like multiple cat lasers of different colors with the beam visible and water dripping from the ceiling like rain.\\n\\nTDLR: got diabetes thought it was the flu very wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "4106  I’ve had type 1 for 14 years this spring and can say confidently its had its fair share of ups and downs. When I was first diagnosed at 9 years old, I seemed to accept it with little to no trouble and adjusted to the lifestyle fairly quickly. Sure, it was tough, especially as a kid, but I always tried my best to remain positive and figured if i was to have a chronic disease I’d prefer it to be something like type 1 diabetes and not something more fatal. I’ve also always struggled with depression and ADHD, which as you can assume took quite the toll on my diabetes management and overall mental health. Despite struggling with depression and ADHD, I was always on top of my diabetes management trough grade school and high school (which I largely attribute to my mom’s help and guidance). However, once I went to college it all changed. I moved across the country and was on my own for the first time in my life, surrounded by completely new people in a state I had never even visited before and consequently, my lifestyle completely changes as well. With the pressure from school, drinking and horrible eating habits, my diabetes management quickly fell by the wayside. \\n\\nI began checking less and less frequently and started taking my health less seriously as I went through college. I was unmedicated for both my ADHD (which only seemed to get worse with stress from both my health and school) and my depression during college, and besides from talk-therapy I felt as though I had no outlet. It became a constant and exhausting loop: stress/adhd —&gt; not  taking care of myself —&gt; denial —&gt; depression/guilt. \\n\\nMy ADHD and depression quickly became insurmountable. I went into a weird phase of denial where I just would push my health and diabetes into the corner of my mind. I practically pretended like I didn’t have a chronic illness at all, and in a weird way it felt liberating. For once in my life, I didn’t feel as ostracized, didn’t feel like a burden to my friends and wasn’t  constantly worried about my future health. The denial was deep; I would first go weeks without testing my blood sugar, then months. \\n\\nBy the end of my senior year in college, I was testing my blood sugar once a month on average (if I was lucky!). I pushed it so far out of my mind that the idea of going back to managing my diabetes felt way too overwhelming. The guilt and depression manifested as anger and I would take it out in several different ways: blowing up at my friends over really trivial things, self-hatred, and indulging in really risky behavior. I gave myself a “timeline”, and in it I only saw myself living to 38-45 because of my poor diabetes management and risky behavior with drugs and alcohol. Drugs quickly became an escape mechanism, and a dangerously effective one at that. At this point, I just didn’t care. \\n\\nAround this time, I was hospitalized for DKA and put in the ICU for a week and a half. I’ve never felt worse in my life. I truly thought it was the end and that I was dying. I had no energy, couldn’t even stand without falling over, threw up everything I put into my body and just generally felt like the life had been sucked out of me. I was telling myself that “I knew my body” and could “read the signals of low/high blood sugar with little to no effort at all”. My hospitalization made me quickly realize that that wasn’t so. I wish I could say that it was a wake-up call, but it wasn’t. It only sent me into further denial and served as a sort of “threshold”, which I’d use to justify my reckless behavior. I would tell myself, “being in the hospital wasn’t *that* bad.” And it gave me the ability to falsely rationalize my inability to manage my health and life in general. \\n\\nNow I’m graduated college, looking for a job and still struggling immensely with my diabetes management, ADHD and depression. Having diabetes is a curse in itself, but coupled with mental illness and attention deficit disorders feels like a death sentence. I feel helpless and like such a burden, not only to my family and friends but to myself. In the meantime, I’ve met with a psychiatrist to treat my ADHD with medication. I plan on taking my depression more seriously as well, and will be seeking therapy soon. Has anyone else here dealt with depression and ADHD? What is your advice on how to turn my life around?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

She uses a pump and a Dexcom (G6). Our last order of sensors got back ordered so we’re in the middle of a two week wait to get more. No big deal. We love the dexcom but it’s not unusual for her to take a break from it sometimes. \\n\\nWell we went out for lunch ch yesterday and she was annoyed because she forgot to charge her meter so she was waiting for it to come back to life with one of those portable chargers. Again, minor annoyance. She didn’t seem super stressed about it and we weren’t either. But, just making conversation, I did say something along the lines of are you missing the dexcom? This is when she kind of unloaded, saying she didn’t care, it sucked regardless, she was really freakin sick of having diabetes no matter what and nothing makes it better, etc etc. \\n\\nIn the moment, just trying to diffuse the situation, her dad and I did our best to empathize and support her, and also reiterated that even though it’s no ones fault that her pancreas crapped out, it’s all of our responsibility to manage it even when it sucks ass. She did calm down relatively quickly, and that was kind of that. But I know her well enough to know that was the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\nI know the obvious answer here is that diabetes burnout is a very real thing, painfully common among T1 teens, and she needs counseling. And I totally agree. She needs counseling for a lot of things and she has been in and out over the years. But the poor kid just doesn’t want to go. She’s so over it. I know we’re the parents here and we can force the issue but I am struggling with forcing her to do more diabetes-related shit she just doesn’t want to do. I mean, damn. I’m with her on this. I’m freaking sick of it too. I hate this for her more than I have words for. \\n\\nSo I turn to you, T1s of Reddit. With the full understanding that counseling is probably where we’ll end up on this, are there things we can do at home or in conjunction with her school nurse, etc., to help combat this in other ways? Do we enroll her in a sport or an acting class or something to distract her? Do we go full force and talk about it a lot to get it out in the open? Or do we just say screw it and keep beating the dead horse with therapy? I am just clueless and my heart hurts for my poor kid. \\n\\nThanks in advance, I appreciate this community a lot. I’ve lurked for years on another account and taken so many lessons from your experiences. Your strength and humor are humbling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "4222  I have a few that stick out. All were related to low sugar. \\n\\nBefore I switched to a pump and CGM, back when I was pretty disobedient and refused to test before making adjustments, I woke up in the middle of the night and my hands were numb and tingly, I immediately assumed it was high sugar and I grabbed a syringe and injected 4 units, then right after I reached for my tester.  \\nMy sugar was 38 and I confused the effects  of my low to just being tired, also realized I was laying and my hands and they were just asleep. \\n\\nOnce on a mountain drive, I started feeling low on the way home, tested and was 58, I reached in my lunch pale and realized I packed diet instead of regular, I was still about 20 min from the city, I started panicking and digging around while speeding and trying to maintain control of the vehicle, all while fighting the effects of a low, I found a single packet of sugar for coffee under my seat, I ate the entire thing and I made it to the store and grabbed soda, still feeling like shit but eventually got better. I believe that sugar packet was JUST enough to keep me steady till I got there. \\n\\nLast incident was with the pump, I have the Medtronic 670g. I was fairly new to the pump at the time and I was in a hurry, conversating, and I needed to change out the reservoir but didn't have time to change the tubing, I fucked up two things MAJOR, I left the tubing connected to my body and when i removed the empty reservoir I forgot to rewind the plunger so it was still all the way up. I filled the reservoir with 200 units of insulin and pushed it into the pump, it was hard to push in and I didn't think twice, it was because the plunger was up and as I was pushing in, I was pushing all the insuling outta the reservoir, through the tubing, and into my stomach. I only noticed because I got pain in my stomach. So I said wait a minute.. NOOOO... I pulled the reservoir out and sure enough, found out I injected myself with almost 200 units of insulin. I live right next to the hospital so I rushed there and they rushed me in the back, they blew some vains while trying to inject the D50 in a hurry, also struggled with my potassium levels crashing. It was a scary experience and painful. My sugar was about 32 for a couple hours, disgusting experience. Then I had to convince the Dr. it wasn't attempted suicide because he has never seen someone take that much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "32    Mysterious spikes suggestions and input appreciatedSince December maybe even November October I ve been struggling to properly regulate my blood sugar Despite 7 years of experience I ve ran out of ideas for what is causing these irregular spikes I would go see my doctor but my appointment is still a another month away without any possibility of getting one sooner https preview redd it 625phcy37oh41 png width 1387 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f1fd46e754394737658712e47c25c90bcb742b65 The graph does a good job of representing how my blood sugar has been acting for a while now This is what a typical day looks like 1 I wake up within range of where I want to be sometimes without the initial spike shown at the end of the graph which to me would indicate that my basal insulin Toujeo is fine 2 I eat breakfast usually 4 slices of bread with salami and cheese which sends my sugar flying the very first spike on the left is caused by this 3 I take an additional dose of bolus insulin Fiasp to get the sugar back down 4 After several 5 6 hours once my blood sugar is relatively close to range I go for a 2nd meal dinner which either despite any kind of fine tuning sends my sugar flying up 13 again or crashing down 3 5 What occurred on that graph is pretty unusual for me where the dose seemed to actually be fine but then later spiked up after me falling asleep Even when I attempt to regulate for a similar meal the following day with minor adjustments the result is either the same or hard in the complete opposite direction 5 The rest of the day is then usually spent trying to fix the chaos that the meals have caused without being able to go for a 3rd meal that day before bed This usually takes 1 3 additional doses of bolus Fiasp insulin to do Other information During January I attempted to get more active at the gym Before then I was taking 30 basal Toujeo units before bed which was a new record high throughout the 7 years for me set in that month After a few sessions at the gym I was back down to my pre December usual 18 units But this only increased the rate of the spikes causing even more confusion and without still being able to eat more than twice a day just made me feel nauseous So these days are mostly spent indoors with minimal activity I ve recently lowered my basal insulin to 19 gradually down from 30 in January as I d wake up below range at night without any additional bolus insulin for hours prior to falling asleep This does seem to change a lot though Last summer I was able to regulate my blood sugar just fine I was regularly jogging and otherwise relatively active So I think I know how to dose under normal conditions I ve spent the better part of my functioning hours those where I m not experiencing strong symptoms to find any sort of reasoning behind these irregular spikes and lack of control I m on my last semester at uni which is certainly can be stressful but wouldn t expect it to be the cause of this long period of consistent irregularities Though I suppose it could have a spiraling effect that again is just a another guess at something that might not even be related Would love some input and

       "109   Type 1 Diabetes and possible pregnancy Can anyone share there experiences WARNING TALK OF MISCARRIAGEHi I m a 20 female i was diagnosed with type 1 a little under two years ago I had gallstones during my pregnancy that caused many complications for me I spend 7 months in Hospital after my son was born and lost my pancreas in the process In the middle of last year I fell pregnant It wasn t planned Two days after the blood test got confirmed I had only taken a at home test before that and the lines were very faint I had a miscarriage Although my partner and I were devastated it was easier to accept as we weren t planning and we ve have already had our fair share of devastating news in the last year or so After all that trauma had passed we seriously talked about expanding our family We originally wanted at least 4 kids but I honestly struggle with my sugar so we knew that wasn t going to happen After talking we decided to have one more kid regardless of gender and we d stop I want to get my tubes tied after our last kid as to not experience anymore unwanted pregnancy as the doctor said they d all most likely end in miscarriages I started to work with my doctor a diabetes nurse and a dietician to work towards a healthy pregnancy My sugar has improved so much but it s nowhere near perfect and we ve had to push make the conceiving date twice now So one with the actually post My last period was in November I ve missed 3 periods now I ve taken 3 at home test all spanned out over the months and all of them negative I wasn t worried at first because my period had been unreliable in the past I thought that perhaps that cycle was starting again After the third month hit I got worried and went to my doctor for a blood test I got the results back today She said they were inconclusive I m not a medical expert so sorry for this bad explanation She said if the human grow hormone I think that s what it s called is below 5 you re not pregnant and if it s above 25 you are pregnant Mine was 10 She said it could be too early to tell and to come back for another blood test in two weeks I was very angry and confused I was sure that I definitely wasn t in the early stages of pregnancy because my period has been late for around 6 weeks so IF I was pregnant I should be further along then that My instant conclusion was that I must have fell pregnant late last year and had miscarriage and I didn t bleed so I might get I ll etc etc it was a moment of panic since my first miscarriage was traumatic and I really wasn t thinking straight Later that day tonight I thought about what my doctor said and the logic of it all If I did have a miscarriage last year there wouldn t be any traces of the hormone left would there I was confused and upset I couldn t wait two more weeks to find out Especially since I ve had two semi low sugars for my readings My sugar is supposed to be between 4 10 My sugars were all 4 3 and 4 which make me start to shake and feel sick I took a at home kit again basically to prove to myself that it was nothing and shake the anxiety It came up positive right away not even the weird very faint line that happened during the miscarriage it looked normally This is important to me because my doctor said that the faint line would have been because there wasn t enough of the hormone in my system to detect That my sugar levels would have caused an early development defect in the embryo and it wouldn t have formed correctly so it stopping growing and produced the hormone So I figured that if the results from the test I did a few days ago said my levels a low but they were higher enough to appear on a at home test then perhaps I am pregnant and there may be a chance of a successful pregnancy I ve been told by almost all the medical experts in my life that the best way to achieve a healthy pregnancy and baby is to have perfect sugar not only during the pregnancy but while you conceive and the first few weeks It basically lays down a perfect foundation for the embryo to form upon I m sure my sugar levels haven t been the best No major lows but a few highs My highest level is supposed to be 10 I ve had 15 17 Has anyone had a similar problem Not the best levels during the start but had a healthy baby Thanks

       "224   Share Your Experiences Best Convenient Insulin BG Setup for 2020Hi I am a 17yr old T1D diagnosed Sep 2018 in Canada and for the past few days I ve been considering upgrading from my current setup of The Freestyle Libre MDI using Humalog Lantus Regular Pens I have looked into pumps including the tubeless omnipod and after having been initially intrigued by the Tandem Dexcom combo due to the level of automation control and accuracy it seems to provide I decided pumps weren t worth it for me at this time due to The discomfort of having a pump on 24 7 esp w exercise bumping into things showering sleeping sweating etc e g I was totally horrified w insulin pens at the start I would sit 30 mins and not be able to inject myself The potential for developing scar tissue and finding new spots to keep putting pumps at esp as the years go by My A1C has been throughout the 6 s as low as 6 3 and as high as 6 9 which doesn t seem to call for pump usage according to me diabetes nurse my TDD has generally been less than 30 units sometimes as low as 15 if I am extremely low carb What I am now considering is using a Freestyle Libre w a Smart Insulin Pen Does anyone know if this see link has materialized and what the extent of the technology is https www mobihealthnews com content novo nordisks new insulin pens will integrate abbotts freestyle libre system https www mobihealthnews com content novo nordisks new insulin pens will integrate abbotts freestyle libre system My ideal vision for diabetes management would be the following if it could happen one app where one can track their food so carbs AND protein are automatically determined based on grams of x y or z in your meal then based on the BG readings from the Libre you are given the amount of insulin you should take it would sense changes in your insulin sensitivity and adapt your carb protein to insulin ratio accordingly as time passes it then tracks your insulin on board and keeps it in mind at future meals exercise if you exercise you can input that it adapts accordingly if it senses a daily dawn phenomenon or blood sugar going low the AI could automatically tell you to increase decrease basal or to bolus insulin or to eat x grams of carbs almost like an artifical pancreas To clarify The AI would keep in mind the amount of insulin your using from the smart pen and would learn to adjust over time Additional Ideas It could suggest foods that don t work well with you or keep in mind your dieting preferences It could have a satiety option and suggest meals you ve had in the past that make you full yet don t raise your BG It could optimize for micronutrients in food as well and tell you what you re lacking in What s the closest to that there now is What are the options in Canada BTW the reason I m going for the Libre and not Dexcom is it seems to last a bit longer 14 vs 10 days and it doesn t seem as intrusive a bit smaller and it seems a bit more convenient Thanks a lot

opportunity for a communal self experiment We currently have 7 Redditors participating from the original thread https www reddit com r diabetes comments ev6zsb does_anyone_elses_readings_go_up_after_a_hot but I m hoping we can get even more people signed up so we can get a really great data set Anyone s who s interested in participating please comment or PM me The basic idea is to agree on a simple experimental protocol each of us run the experiment combine and analyze the data and see if we can figure out 1 Is the shower effect real or a CGM artifact and 2 how does it vary from person to person The 7 of us organized and worked out the protocol using group chat and and a new subreddit r QuantifiedDiabetes https www reddit com r QuantifiedDiabetes

appeared to be a CGM artifact for some it matches BGM and for others they see a BG drop From my PMs some of us have CGM s some have regular BGM s and some have both Questions to answer Is the hot shower effect a real change in blood glucose or an artifact of CGM sensors getting warm or some other environmental change What is the person to person variation in the magnitude and direction of the hot shower effect Protocol Pick a time when your blood glucose is relatively stable no recent meals medication exercise etc Turn on the shower to the hottest temperature you re comfortable with and let the temperature stabilize If possible measure the temperature e g with an instant read thermometer Measure your blood glucose with both a CGM and regular finger stick meter and record the data If you don t have both types of meters use whichever you do have data will still be useful for the second goal Take a 20 minute shower As soon as you finish the shower measure your blood glucose again with both a CGM and regular finger stick meter and record the data Monitor your blood sugar for one hour measure every 15 min for finger stick meter Record anything that might have affected blood glucose during the experiment Repeat the experiment multiple times preferably 3 but any data is better than nothing to assess within person variability Post your data in a comment or PM to u sskaye https www reddit com u sskaye I ll compile it and make available to everyone to analyze If you want your data to be anonymous just let me know and I ll remove all identifying info Optional variations

       "318   Control IQ Pitfalls and Possible WorkaroundsHowdy fellow T1s First off I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now I have been waiting for this for so long it s not even funny But let s talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I ve been on Control IQ Sensor errors So I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session Was it slightly confusing after the hour long training that I didn t actually have to pair my pump to a device Yes Workaround I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected Probably won t have to deal with the likes of this again But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired We ll see So that sensor error I awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing This was not repeat not a compression low I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour after waking up I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 twice What I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do I calibrated It buzzed and told me to test again I did so and recalibrated Within a couple minutes the rise to 160 began on the pump But it didn t do it all at once It did it gradually over 20 minutes Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar It kicked in 2 5 units Um So I suspended basal and waited an hour I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings Still had a ton on board though It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while This was not a relaxing experience Fast forward to today I changed the sensor last night it was getting flakey in the evening This morning there was an actual compression low Even though I was in suspend mode I was actually 170 I waited for it to raise back up after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio Figured that would knock me down to the 120 130 range But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units Needless to say I did not work out and I ended up going low SO IN THE FUTURE Any time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour By then whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won t have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change It should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience This may be a rare occurrence But if it happens to you maybe what I m trying will work for you I ll report here if it happens again Also I ll report it to customer service as well Has anyone else had anything weird happen

       "328   LibreLink App for Libre 2 Alarms not working with Sony Xperia XZ3At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway not for everyone but for hand picked DM I patients like me I had the Libre 1 before I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself and it was good However the Libre 2 is a relevation I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms when they work The problem When you put on the sensor you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor which is exactly 2 weeks You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app but the alarms will go to the reader I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms If you activate with the App the reader won t work I do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3 Also I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife When it works which it did at times the system is absolutely brilliant It kind of gave me a new lease of life I exercise very much and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia BUT The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious No alarms warning in the app Despite this the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings No connection with the sensor regularly also at night All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep Last night I was woken by several of these false alarms This morning I got stupid no connection alarms all through the morning The program asks you to check you sensor but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11 30 a m that at my glucose was 14 mmol l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin So when the system state is No connection the system will not warn about hyper and hypoglucemia Abbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless The whole system is a black box Part of it works through Near field communication NFC part through Bluetooth you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone s Bluetooth configuration pages I have 2 questions to the community 1 Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue 2 Which smartphone do you use I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue Can anyone with Sony Xperia Z5 confirm that the LibreLink App gives out correct alarms Is there another android phone that works reliably against a Libre 2

       "388   Scared and ConfusedHello to everyone who reads this I ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors I m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on I ve been excessively thirsty urinating way more than usual including during the night which I ve NEVER done before extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class and above all I ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat All I was told was my glucose was high and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today Well yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day and then I ate lunch with a friend Shortly after getting lunch we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating I had a migraine and stomach pain again and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could At about 7 30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn t feel nearly that bad I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9 00 when I couldn t stand it anymore mind you I ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER so it s obviously bad I tell the nurse everything that s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done I just kinda got sent away The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton The CT scan comes back normal which isn t surprising and I m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches and then the nurse came in and discharged me At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER I feel incredibly stupid I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork I m just at a loss for words and I don t know what to do

       "542   There s no such thing as a Dexcom G5 transmitter TL DR at the bottom So I switched insurance companies recently thank you USA for your crappy insurance policy My G5 transmitter died with only a week s warning I know I should have paid better attention I contacted my new insurance company to figure out who I needed to go through to get them to pay for part of my new G5 I have sensors due to multiple failures from earlier times that Dexcom kindly replaced I was just trying to get a new G5 transmitter Hello who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today Crazy Lady at medical supply company my insurance pays for I told her my name Hello And what can I help you with today Crazy Lady I d like to see if you guys carry the G5 transmitter me We certainly do carry the G4 transmitter Shall I start a new account for you Crazy Lady I said the G5 transmitter I m not interested in the G4 me They don t make a G5 transmitter They make G5 sensors and a G4 transmitter that goes with the G5 sensors Crazy Lady Umm What I ve been on the G5 for 2 years now me You must be mistaken The sensors that come with the G4 transmitter are labeled as G5 but they do not make a G5 transmitter Crazy Lady No the sensors are labeled as working with both the G4 and the G5 transmitters I ve been on the G5 for 2 years now I think I know they exists me I m sorry ma am but you are mistaken Crazy Lady Ok so what do you say if I ask about the G6 me not wanting the G6 I want the G5 that I have sensors for Yes we also carry the G6 which I can help you ordering right now if you d like Crazy Lady I really wouldn t like the G6 I would like the G5 me I can get you G5 sensors but we only carry the G4 and the G6 because Dexcom doesn t make a G5 transmitter Crazy Lady I ve had the G5 transmitter for two years now and suddenly they don t make it me Ma am you can contact Dexcom if you d like to and they will tell you that the only transmitters they make are the G4 and the G6 The G5 is the sensors to the G4 There is no such thing as a Crazy Lady as I hung up on her Sigh I called the other company my insurance covers They had it and are shipping it out to me expedited I can t believe I wasted so much time trying to get an idiot to believe something she knew she was right about TL DR I switched insurance companies The crazy lady on the phone didn t believe me that there was a Dexcom G5 transmitter when I ve been on it for 2 years now Insisted she was right and that Dexcom only makes a G4 and a G6 Hung up on her while she was insisting I contact Dexcom to prove she was right Called another company which had it and is shipping it to me ASAP

       "655   New and still learning support would be nice Hello reddit users and other T1D I am new to the reddit thing and I ve basically been looking for support since I ve been diagnosed all my family members who have had T1D are no longer with us so I m fighting this by myself and blindly So let me just say that my father was diagnosed at 25 and he never took it seriously and it took his life My grandmother moms side got diagnosed at like 60 Due to a car accident Through out my life i was warned about this disease and so were my brothers of course like the rest of us I ignored it and kept being a kid eating anything and everything My life hasn t been very great and a lot of it I couldn t help because I was a kid I m currently 23 years old right now Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles Yeah I d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day l was even craving the most random things I ve never craved before after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you re under DKA all I could say was ok I called my mom and said mom I m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly I have diabetes There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here I don t have insurance and my job isn t very good they ve cut my hours because of how sick I ve been I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn t listen to me she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin Levemir Novolog at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir my sugars were still sitting in the 380 420 I kept begging her that it s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I m killing myself rather than helping myself I ended up losing about 30 pounds in 3 months I was 145 lbs before diagnosed today 1 9 2020 I m now 114lbs and not happy at all I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I m not even financially stabled or have insurance On 1 4 2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 in June it was at 7 5 thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir so even when I was injecting myself with insulin nothing was happening to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I ve been using Levemir it wasn t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I m doing everything I can possibly do I want to be apart of this community and have people I can talk to when things get overwhelming my boyfriend is my supporter but he still doesn t fully understand how much this effects someone is there anyone else how there who struggles to live daily because they aren t stable I m tired of feeling alone with this stupid sickness

they asked to use my phone I m a brown belt in karate and blue belt in brazilian jiu jitsu i felt like i could more than handle these guys I threw a punch knocked out the first guy and took the other guy down and started fighting him on the ground 20 or so seconds go by and i felt a sharp kind of hit to the top of my head my shoulder my lower back stomach arms at first i thought it was some brass studded knuckles but they both got up and ran I realized what had just happened i was stabbed multiple times I was very lucky to run 3 blocks to the hospital with a collapsed lung i made it I fell unconscious from blood loss in the front entrance of the hospital and nurses saw me and i was wheelchaired in I woke up to many nurses and doctors working on stitching me up and pumping blood into me

lost all motor mobility of my body i was also stabbed in the hand arm shoulder and the back of my neck I needed brain surgery a piece of the knife was imbedded into my skull and JUST millimetres from my brain Surgery went great i recovered and took me about 3 weeks before i was discharged fast forward about one month i started having pains on the top of my head where i had surgery i went to the hospital and i had a very rare blood infection in my body from the dirty knife i was stabbed with hunting blade and i needed to take IV medication everyday for 2 hours they told me if i don t take it

       "787   Back again Looking for advice US Healthcare questions I posted a thread here 7 months ago https old reddit com r diabetes_t1 comments bldosc need_help_trying_to_understand_budget_us_insurance looking for advice about moving to the US from another country I ve now been in the US since the end of October and healthcare is really the only thing that remains a pain in the arse I m enrolled on my partner s work health care plan now which is by Anthem Blue Cross we did think initially this was Blue Shield The plan cost 28 a month for my partner but once I was added on the price unexpectedly went up to 250 This is even before getting any medication My partner works part time and I m unable to work until I get my paperwork from the government and even then who knows how long it will take for me to find work Since I couldn t enroll in medicare we figured the only option was to go with the work benefits They wouldn t tell us their formulary before signing up and we had to wait until coverage started yesterday Upon looking most insulins are not covered I am currently on Novorapid Novolog in the US I think and Tresiba both of which are listed as EXCLUDED on the formulary Humalog and Lantus are listed however are these the closest comparable insulins Which combination would you recommend I feel really bad about how much this plan will take from my partner s pay cheque so I was considering outright getting private coverage out of my own pocket Are there any good more affordable plans out there Or am I better sticking with my partner s coverage I did look at Blue Shield but I have to call to get a quote Unfortunately this whole thing is incredibly stressful and confusing and the only area I ve kind of felt out of my depth and I keep getting more questions and I m not sure where to head to have them answered A few other things Our understanding is we need to set up a primary care doctor first discuss with them what I need and they refer me to an Endo who is in our network who then will write a prescription for me and I go and take that to a pharmacy Is this correct What would be the correct course of action for going via a community pharmacy for 340b prices Follow the same steps as above and then sign up at the local community health centre Could the endo add things to the prescription that aren t listed on the formulary and I still get coverage or is that just up to me to pay the full amount CGMs are on the formulary as non preferred if I filled out the FreeStyle Libre form on their website and got a prescription do I still have to pay full price for the sensors for example Which insulins have manufacturer discounts I think most of the Novo Nordisk ones have them available but it doesn t seem like these are covered by my insurance Thank you so much for your help

       "802   My thoughts on Control IQ vs DIY LoopingOkay so I have been using Tandem s Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts amp x200B First of all before this experiment I was DIY looping with Omnipod off label Being off label this system has it s quirks but there are a couple features intensity and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem amp x200B Before jumping into what I like and don t like about Control IQ I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works First off Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading it s only integrated with Dexcomg G6 to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus just be increased no change at all be decreased or be completely suspended The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes Below is the Control IQ tier system amp x200B 180 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg dL within 30 minutes there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus The correction bolus is 60 of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg dL every 60 minutes This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing 160 180 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is increased 112 5 159 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is not changed 112 4 70 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes basal is decreased 70 mg dL If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg dL within 30 minutes basal is suspended amp x200B My thoughts After about 3 days of using Control IQ my average is higher than what I like However there are less lows which is awesome BUT my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping The reason for this is that unlike looping Control IQ software doesn t not use carbs on board Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten This would be fine if you didn t have to use the CGM reading but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus the Tandem pump doesn t remember how many carbs on are board For instance I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced bolus of 0 6 U I then trying to be good used the recommendation I then decided to have an apple so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg dL the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account amp x200B Fast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg dL This isn t super high but this could have been completely avoided ALSO I couldn t stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions I would have been much higher It recommended 0U but I took 0 7U usually I m about 1U for an apple amp x200B The other feature I m not crazy about is the tube I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice especially during workouts amp x200B A couple features I DO like amp x200B I like that the software works all the time Even if it isn t nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments With my closed loop Omnipod system I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink device used to connect pod to phone and phone were connected and working amp x200B It s also nice not to have to carry an additional device the rileylink but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump So that s not a big change amp x200B I like the sleep feature This allows for a tighter range but doesn t allow for the automated correction bolus However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg dL your basal is increased With normal settings basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg dL or above Oh and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system amp x200B Overall I think for the masses Control IQ could be rather helpful tool However I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days amp x200B TAKEAWAY Control IQ is less work but doesn t allow the as tight control compared to looping DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on but I like the control and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature amp x200B This is just a short snapshot I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ I have early access to this because I m a T1D CDE and a RDN It s a bit of work to review and report but I hope this information is helpful to you   \n",
       "847   Social aspects of t1d and insurance info Hello all I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer in my case my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue I also take biologic meds for my illness and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer I ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes the illness doesn t seem to have a significant impact on the person s daily life and their overall ability to function and work a normal job I ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me s in order to cover the costs of insulin or having to resort to Walmart insulin that sounds atrocious when they don t have insurance and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance NO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d What are your options where you live in the event that you don t have health insurance How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn t available Some states offer Medicaid and among the states that offer Medicaid some offer a program called Medicaid buyin where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid Regarding employment how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don t have to cover health insurance If you do have a job that offers you health insurance have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment I don t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person s ability to access a life sustaining medication this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor that s it I realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive but are generally able bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands This would also include working long hours as well as overtime Someone like myself wouldn t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities My condition wouldn t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn t want to remain in that state for any length of time And lastly how does your illness impact things for you socially Are there social situations job situations or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you How have strangers reacted How have friends and or significant others reacted I live in Colorado where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions Here are the links for that as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state Your state may have a similar buyin program I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized https www colorado gov pacific hcpf medicaid buy program working adults disabilities https www ssa gov disability professionals bluebook AdultListings htm Also feel free to ask me any questions about my autoimmune disease I m intrigued by science and medical stuff and how it impacts our daily lives

       "923   Very Important Question If anybody could help with what they know an answer I d greatly appreciate it very much Hi I m Kaylynn My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult My husband takes 2 different insulin s 1 of them is long acting Lantus amp the other is fast acting Humalog Unfortunately amp absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail he has been they re since 9 27 19 presently We had talked to somebody who works there who answered questions we had I had brought up my husband s diabetes amp the difficulties he faces with his diabetes this woman assured me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and knew what they were doing They re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different when my husband first went in it took 2 3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him learn about his medical conditions medications all that stuff He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are 7am he gets both Lantus amp Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin s then the night medications that were approved Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm That s it Okay now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I m saying is there anything I can try to do about this Recommendations I d very much appreciate it I m lost with what I can even do about this I know this is really long please bare with me I m new here amp trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand Okay here we go So this is what started first then so on so on I received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly he doesn t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn t care So I got up got dressed amp got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call amp explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home amp that since you all are administrating his medications to him calling in refills etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail and we don t know when or if he s going to be released I know this is very long so I m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it s very important I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that contact the pharmacy because that s not they re responsibility And that whoever basically is his other half emergency contact on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications So what I ve been dealing with lately is when he calls not every call but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up amp then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him that what they were wanting to do would not help him at all they forced him to take it and he nearly OD So then they put him back on his original dose There s been so much damn more This is already long as hell So lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin s and put him only on Novolog 70 30 and he said no he wouldn t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn t know what he s talking about having to do with his insulin but 100 without a doubt think they know what they re doing They re wrong af changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20 30units when his sugars to high That would kill him PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP PLEASE PLEASE DO I DON T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE

       "1203  You all know the A1C is a total scam right I was originally writing this as a comment for another post but I got too way many thoughts on this so I just had to make this it s own thread Can I just take this as an opportunity to point out that the perception that the A1C metric of average glucose control is good It s not It s total bullshit It s laughable and anytime an endo excitedly pats me on the back for having a good one it immediately makes me want to look for a new endo Which I ve done a lot Test your endo if this metric is their only quantitative assessment of your behaviors as a diabetic then you have a shitty endo I have met a lot of shitty endos so it s a trigger with many indicators that I m very sensitive too An A1C purportedly gives you a metric correlative to your long term glucose average over the past several weeks My A1C is always amazing Like weirdly so But it s not because I m a great T1 It s because I m a really bad one lol Or maybe a really good one with bad days Or a great one I m not sure and that s the point An A1C is incapable of distinguishing whether anyone is good or bad My glucose control has two main modes of behavior on any given day First is just very flat all day between 120 160 So pretty much perfect A mode that would lend itself to a great A1C in the end I drink a lot of water run and am very strategic about the carb quality more than the count of the carb for any given meal on these days fast carbs bad A philosophy that s never taught but yields way better control than anything an endo or diabetic educator could show you I always assumed this good bad carb thing is an intuition all T1s get several years into having it The second mode of glucose behavior is a day I m active and wanting tons and tons of short acting sugary things ice cream cake chocolate combined with TONS of caffeine These are my I m young and strong and can do tf I want days where I m generally in a great mood and not giving any fucks Not a great example of health in any light but we gotta love ourselves Sometimes that means being self indulgent To my point though on these days my sugar is a harmonic set of fast moving roller coaster waves Huge and quick glucose spikes in the high 200 to low 300 range because it s short acting carbs followed by insulin over compensating followed by huge and very fast sudden drops into lows below 50 60 again short acting carbs The insulin over compensating is an intentional part of the scam too by the way I over compensate means I get to eat more junk food in the end As you can surmise I should not be proud of these days But type 1 diabetics have very cool cheat codes in normal life the normie s don t get such as huge control over our energy levels in any state of activity marathon runners unite set your basal to zero and cruise by everyone else or our own ghetto version of Aderall lows keep you spritely and very awake at 4am or food entitlement so you don t have to share your freakin fries The can t share I took insulin for that sorry has never failed I will very ashamedly exploit all of these on occasion I will say it now I know this paragraph will trigger people and totally agree 99 of this is horrible advice But most of you would be lying if you said you ve never done any of these Here s the kicker though if an A1C is a long term average of the past several weeks what do days of repeated huge spikes and repeated huge lows average out too Well a spike of 260 and a low of 40 average out to 150 a number that would if by itself be represented with a great A1C In an aforementioned roller coaster day this whole day would then theoretically yield an awesome A1C Ultimately if these are the two main modes of glucose behavior I have then my A1C is always awesome Tons of highs mixed with tons of lows gives you the same A1C as a perfectly flat line at 150

       "1207  Tslim s Director of Sales told me they don t want me as a client anymore So 3 days ago I was do for a pump renewal as my 5 years was up I am a tslim user since November 24 2014 I have had many pumps that have broken in the past most diagnosed as a battery failure malfunction The broken pumps had nothing to do with anything I did wrong except for one where the screen cracked while I was sleeping 1 month ago I was contacted by Tandem and they told me I would be getting upgraded when my pump warranty was up in a month The localbrep Jordyn Dooley was nice and got me all set up with a customer service rep Both were very enthusiastic about me getting the new pump During the last 2 weeks I went and got the dexcom G6 in anticipation for my new tslim pump So this past Monday I never got the renewal call as promised Tuesday no call Now I am concerned and I called them They tell me someone will call me back Today I call them and I got told that they won t be issuing me a new pump and to call my doctor I asked to speak to a supervisor because the woman on the phone was being very short and rude towards me and I could sense a very bad time in her voice She refused to get me a supervisor and hung up I called back and the next customer service rep Brooke told me there was no one at all at Tandem for me to talk to After some back and forth with her she tells me that the Director of Sales will call me on Monday I ask for his name and she mumbles some profanity then hangs up So now I am pretty upset and I call back again She just keeps picking up and immediately disconnecting and this happened like 5 or 6 times I am beginning to have some panic attacks this is my life and I am not calling about getting like my gutters cleaned here I go upstairs and ask my wife to call from her phone The customer service rep Brooke immediately answers and is now talking to my wife She is extremely rude to my wife when she realizes my wife is calling to get some information for me She gives my wife the name of the Director of Sales Jim Simpson but refuses to give any other info on how to contact him Ultimately she just hangs up on my wife as well 5 hours later I actually get a call from Jim Simpson He tells me I am no longer a good fit for Tandem because I am not a good look for them with all of the broken pumps I have had I tell him that I don t be live that is very fair as the pumps that have broken were not my fault I mean it s not like I have done anything to cause the pumps to break I live a very normal life although I do have many problems from my 32 years with diabetes kidney disease advanced retinopathy and neuropathy I go to the gym 4 5 days a week but that is all of the activity I am involved in so the pumps are not put through any stress What do I do from here Diabetes is enough of a problem and it has been a lot on my wife and my son on top of all of the other problems that have come from my diabetes To be treated like this by a company that is supposed to be doing things to make life better for diabetics is extremely upsetting I am on Medicare so I don t have many choices I would switch to Medtronic s closed loop pump but unfortunately Medicare won t allow me to use the Medtronic cgm so tandem is really my only choice Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do Maybe the best thing is for my story to go viral so Tandem knows I am not just another number and I am a person a diabetic with feelings and a person who doesn t deserve to be treated like they don t matter Thank you for reading all of this if you did

       "1299  Looking for some advice for my daughterMy daughter was diagnosed with t1d 3 months ago today She just turned 5 and was 4 at dx She takes Humalog Jr and her basal is Tresiba she also has a Dexcom G6 It has been a struggle I m trying to follow all the guidelines I was given in the hospital but I m also trying to figure out some things on my own I m really looking for some good advice or academic resources because I want to understand specifically how the body is working I don t feel like her treatment team is answering my questions they sort of ignore my concerns and tell me to change her carb ratios Sorry for the super long post and at least one crazy question 1 How can I estimate or calculate the absorption of carbs into the bloodstream For example I was taught if my daughter is below 80 to give 15g carbs and check again 15 minutes later That seems to spike her way up into the 300 s and she won t come down even with a correction dose If I look at it from a purely numbers perspective I see it as pouring 15000mg carbs into about 14dL of blood Giving me 1071mg dL which obviously isn t the case because she only spikes to the upper 300s However I would like to be able to estimate how many carbs are going to end up in the blood stream so I can more accurately gauge what treating a low should look like I m also just interested in the biological process I know this will be different for different foods but when I treat a low I always end up giving her a high 2 Related to number one I d like to know more about the process of digestion and absorption of carbs into the body and how long the process from eating to eliminating takes I ve gotten my daughters pre bolus down pretty well Her turn happens between 20 24 minutes post injection a 10 minute pre bolus will yield a relatively flat line any longer and she ll go hypo before dinner can kick in any shorter and she starts going high and it s like her body ignores the insulin Here is the issue I can almost set my watch to when her Humalog loses effectiveness appx 2 hours post meal she steadily goes up until she levels off in the 240 260 range 3 She has been having really weird and unexplained lows usually at night Can anyone tell me what causes these Three nights in a row hours after dinner so presumably her fast acting really isn t active anyone she will drop dangerously low She eventually dropped down to 46 last night 41 on dex 46 on finger stick When I gave her a juice box she was 71 on finger stick 15 minutes later she was 46 So I gave her another juice box and some fruit gummies because I was terrified This sent her to 400 over the course of 2 3 hours I don t understand how she can crash so hard without being given insulin 4 Lastly I can t seem to find an answer on this one Does a t1d need carbs and insulin at every meal Sometimes my daughter just wants eggs and bacon or a plain hot dog cut up but I make her have toast or fries because she needs her insulin Is this a valid thought process Basically everyone I ve asked says that s a question for the doctor which sucks because we only see the nurses and NP right now I don t get to take her to see the doctor until the end of December I am not in any way trying to avoid carbs I understand the important role carbs play in the body I m just not sure if a carb free meal here and there should be avoided It would be nice if I had a chart that said A 5 y o girl who is active a lot needs 60 carbs per day

       "1302  My 3 year old son is showing signs of remission Very confusedHi all First of all this is my first post here so I d just like to say thank you I ve been reading so many posts from you all over the past 8 weeks It s been helpful and insightful so thank you I ll give you a little background to start with My 3 year old son was diagnosed with T1D about 8 weeks ago We d taken him to the Doctor due to a lack of any real appetite and lots of trips to the toilet for a wee They did a quick urine test and found sugar So onto the finger prick test and they found his blood sugar at 23 and sent us straight to hospital to get started with Insulin Just like that my son was a diabetic I m sure you all know how the story goes Since then we ve been dosing him with 2 0U of Levamir every morning And an insulin to carb ratio that has dropped considerably over this last 8 week period We started with a 1U insulin to 15g of carbs That was steadily increased and was sat at 1U to 35gc over the past 4 weeks Im happy to go into more detail on the numbers if required anyway but I ll leave it at that for now Last Wednesday he started being sick uncontrollably as if he d picked up a stomach bug This carried on for around an hour while we attempted to keep his blood sugars up through any means necessary He ended up going to hospital with a blood sugar of 2 7 by the time we go there Straight on a drip over the next 24 hours due to this severe hypo which we thought was brought on by his sickness The more we have thought about it though why would he drop so low so quickly We were a little confused We got him home on the Thursday night and everything seemed to be getting back to normal but on the Sunday night he took another downward turn and started being sick again Another bad hypo and a call for an ambulance They ended up giving him a glocogen injection to increase his bloods enough to temporarily make him alert again Again we wondered why he d dropped so severely Was his food just sitting in his stomach so the insulin was then just causing the hypo On top of the sickness as well The next part of all of this is where it gets really weird We ve brought him home yesterday after 4 days in the hospital where he d been back on the drip and managed to start eating enough for them to let him out Since Sunday night though we haven t given him Insulin at all We ve only given him 1 5u of Levamir which has now been dropped to 1 0u His bloods have not been outside of a normal range since Sunday night when he had the last hypo How is that happening My mind is doing overtime trying to work out what the hell is going on with my sons body So many questions Is he cured Was he ever diabetic Will it come back Did he throw up his diabetes Was it something else like a kidney infection and the diagnosis was completely wrong but the hospital stay has accidentally helped him cure whatever it is that was actually wrong with him I m over the moon my boy is back at home But I m a little Confused at the moment If any of you lovely lovely people can help me and my family out with some experiences or advice then we d be so grateful you ve no idea Thank you for taking the time to read These words are just a literal brain dump so apologies if some of it is confusing I ll happily answer any questions

       "1337  Dexcom Why I don t use blood sugar sensors and why I think they can be drastically improved I want to get some feedback on why I still chose not to use blood sugar sensors Have they improved If so please let me know I have been a diabetic since 2006 and I m now 20 years old I m a 3rd year electric engineering student and have played tennis in college for 2 years Disclaimer I used the Dexcom G6 a year ago please let me know if they have since solved any of the following issues About a year ago I tried the dexcom G6 and was overall disappointed with my experience here s why 1 Alarms that you can t turn off I understand that the FDA mandates having an alarm for low blood sugar that can t be turned off but I found that it made the dexcom system especially annoying to use I was in a digital logic class and my blood sugar went below the alarm threshold it was about 50 So obviously I knew about it and was actively treating the low blood sugar with snacks but the alarm kept going off periodically throughout the class about 3 times total within a 45 minute period Are there better ways to manage this feature now In my opinion this feature alone makes the system not viable for a professional user someone who has to attend meetings or college classes because it disrupts everything and gets everyone s attention My argument for having the option to eliminate this feature is that a manual blood sugar meter doesn t make sound at all it doesn t even know what your blood sugar is unless you test it 2 accuracy and delay From my understanding the blood sugar sensor doesn t measure blood sugar directly it reads a from secondary source present in the body which is a good indicator of blood sugar When I used the dexcom the blood sugar readings would only update every 5 10 minutes and they wouldn t be as accurate as a normal blood sugar meter I believe this is a huge issue for treating lows because that is where accuracy and delay become very important A blood sugar difference of 50 and 70 means two completely different things as far as treatment goes With a 50 I need to eat something immediately and with high sugar content With a 70 can get away with making a piece of toast will be more sustaining after my blood sugar has recovered 3 Can you save data over a long period of time on a smart device and perform statistical analysis on that data I study engineering so if I really wanted to I could take all my blood sugar readings plug them into excel and have excel run distributions averages peaks etc Why don t I That takes way too much time I think since Dexcom already takes the data for you it should have the option to add measurements For instance you could say I want to know my average blood sugar over the last 2 weeks to siri or google assistant and your phone should just be able to tell you based on the data from the dexcom app If this isn t a possibility right now I think a bunch of smart engineers would easily be able to figure it out Engineers at Google are smart enough to track everyone s online profile and use it for ad tracking they could easily take data that is already stored in the dexcom app perform calculations on that data and display it to a user Another application of this would be to display danger zones where blood sugars typical reach their maximum and minimum on a daily basis So your phone would tell you hey based on data from the last month 2 times a week you have low blood sugars around 3pm consider lowering your dose for lunch I think this is achievable Has anyone tried to log this autonomously using the current Dexcom system Please let me know your thoughts and thanks for reading

       "1394  Mom won t leave me 18f alone about blood sugarsI ve been t1d for nearly 7 years always had what my doctors call very good control a1c under 7 usually around 6 since about a year after diagnosis I m on a pump and have dexcom g6 that I use constantly and my parents follow my dex Since I was diagnosed when i was already a very independent 12 year old I took the lead on my diabetes management and have pretty much done everything myself for the last 7 years My parents are there to support me and my mom has helped me fight with insurance deal with bad pump sites bleeders etc They re incredibly helpful and my biggest supporters in everything However my mom is really controlling She has her own anxieties and issues which she tends to project onto me Basically she texts and bothers me constantly when my sugar is gt 180 even though I don t need a reminder to deal with a high and we ve discussed that In high school it wasn t too bad since I was home a lot and she could see that I was bolusing for the highs or changing my pump site out when I needed to Now I m a freshman in college living in the dorms I live 20 minutes from my parents which I m okay with I like my school so it s not as if they couldn t get to me if something happened and my school is in a big city 10 minutes away from my doctors and some amazing hospitals so if anything serious happened I m literally 10 minutes away from the nearest emergency care we talked about it before I left and agreed that when I m low I get a simple you ok text from mom or dad or both and if I don t answer within 15 minutes they can call me to check in When I m over 200 we agreed that they could text me once after about an hour if my sugar isn t budging My mom totally does not go by this agreement and I m furious when I m high she texts me once asking if I m okay Once I say yes she gives it another 30 minutes before saying it s not budging then continues to text me again and again every 30 minutes at least to ask whether I m changing my site if I m handling it what I m doing etc I feel like diabetics understand that sometimes you just get those stubborn ass highs that don t go away no matter what you try And now that my stress levels are back up from hard classes and it took me months to adjust to the dining hall diet new sleep schedule and new friends those stubborn highs have been coming up more frequently so yeah I don t have straight lines on my dexcom anymore whatever I m happier my doctors have said multiple times that they have no concerns and I m doing great and my last a1c a couple months ago was 6 my mom STILL won t leave me alone even after I tell her how much it bothers me When she constantly bugs me and asks what I m doing about my sugars it makes me feel like she thinks I m incapable of handling things on my own even though I ve been doing it for years I know she s coming from a place of genuine concern and worry but it feel so hurtful A few months ago she even asked if I was intentionally making my sugars high and not correcting them It was a few times in one week that they were never over 350 and always came down within a few hours I was so furious that I didn t even yell I just sternly told her that I would never do something like that and was incredibly hurt that she thought something like that when I ve been doing really well emotionally Sorry for this being long she s texting me as I write this and it s infuriating I do have a therapist and plan to bring this up w her next session but I won t be seeing her for another week TL DR My mom constantly texts me when I m over 200 won t leave me alone no matter how much I ask and makes me feel like I m not capable of handling my own diabetes My a1c is 6 and my doctors are super happy with my current control

       "1462  New here so here s my story it s long so read it if you have a couple minutes M 55 y o 5 10 168 lbs I was diagnosed with type 1 some 44 years ago I guess I have achieved Crafty Veteran status The treatment of diabetes was far different back in the mid70s The disposable needles were new to the scene The three types of insulin L R and NPH were taken from pigs and cows Blood monitors didn t exist Rather there was this test tape you would have to pee on to see your approximate blood sugar level within the last 6 hours Unreliable There was one major sugar free soda Tab which was pretty awful but I learned to love As a kid receiving a diagnosis the doctors and nurses approached it with unreasonable expectations No sugar ever No birthday cake with friends no ice cream in the summer no s mores at the campfire no Halloween candy no Trix and Cap n Crunch nothing Ever No They forced you into hiding your occasional Oreo birthday dalliances rather than help you deal with the blood sugars when they became raised The standard then was to count calories by using an exchange diet There would be a diet set up for you by a dietician who factored in your caloric needs based on age growth rate activity level etc Every single day you would eat the same types of food in the same quantities because the types of insulin would be most effective this way The needles on the syringes were 27 gauge about four times as thick as the 31 gauge needles today The first consumer level blood monitor hit the market around 1977 and it wasn t easy You would be fortune to get a reading within 8 minutes The machine was quadruple the size of today s monitors so packing it to take with you was an ordeal It required calibration every time you turned it on a two minute process You then had to do a trial run with a solution that had a preset level of sugar If the reading was within a specified range the machine was good to go After calibration and successful testing you inserted the test strip which required a HUGE drop of blood Too little wouldn t work and you would have to toss the test strip By this time the machine would often shut off and you d have to start from scratch After adding the big drop of blood to the test strip you had to rinse it after 30 seconds being careful not to do it early or wait too long Then after another minute or so it would give you a reading Ugh The pig based insulin was scary The human DNA origin insulin of today is very user friendly That old stuff would cause reactions that were extreme It interfered with my ability to think often causing incoherent actions spasms and a loss of verbal communication to the point that I only could speak two words yes and no The human insulin reactions are a walk in the park comparatively The reactions would slowly set in until it flipped an on off switch in my thought processes During a severe reaction people would always ask questions but they were yes no questions Are you okay Yes Do you need help No The concerned people would gather around because they could tell something wasn t right I would get defensive because my brain was misfiring and because I was surrounded by a dozen unfamiliar faces all talking about me I only got kicking people away violent once but that s once too many I have been ejected out of stores and restaurants and classrooms until I could pull yourself together man Why are you doing drugs and coming in here dude The way things have progressed and advanced in the treatment of diabetes is quite remarkable Things are easier now My time anymore isn t overwhelmed with strict dieting and monitoring and freaking out about misinformation I have been told my whole life that a remedy for the condition is just around the corner maybe even in a couple years I am still waiting patiently haha I handle my diabetes with Admelog and Basaglar pens I am an archaeologist by trade so I have no capability to use insulin pumps that can be crushed lost or yanked out deep in the jungle where disease is abundant and cleanliness is unexpected I do not get A1C readings more than once a year because I am on MediCal that doesn t support super attentiveness to health It s a program that endorses simple maintenance rather than aggressive proactive treatment My A1C readings have been in the 7 to 8 range and I am pleased with that I count carbs and adjust the insulin according to the quantity of food I eat which varies from day to day I am afforded enough test strips to test twice a day and I do well with it My kidneys and eyes are functioning like new

       "1654  Fun story I did not know could happen with Type 1 RhabdomyolyosisBackground I m a fairly healthy guy Tall and very lean 6 4 and 175 pounds I run 20k a week As I am writing this up it is from a hospital bed in the intensive care unit I took insulin for a nothing special meal sandwich and veggies Took the insulin on my way home so I was primed to eat when I walked in the door 20 min later I am standing in front of the fridge and then NOTHING I m gone I black out I assume I then fell on my back on the concrete floor of my Kitchen I passed out from a low blood sugar Not a new story yes we ve all heard of this happening to people before The next parts are where it gets weird I was completely unconscious with a blood sugar below the 40s according to my continuous Dexcom G6 for 6 hours I woke up at 3am the next day When I woke up I couldn t feel anything below my waist I couldn t move my legs I was weak and barely conscious I managed to eventually pull my body with only my arms to some fruit snacks downed 30g of carbs and just continued laying on my floor until it kicked in At this point I thought the legs thing was really weird but I ll get control back I guess when my sugar is up Right No Sugar was up 20 min later and I was still paralyzed I was now going delirious from panic Did a Hey Siri Call to my best friend to calm me down I didn t know what was happening to me I didn t know how to fix it I was powerless I was an athletic runner who couldn t move his legs anymore I was screaming in my head He calmed me down and got an ambulance to me All my doors were locked so I dragged myself to the door with my arms to let them in They got me to the ER It turns out I was suffering a combination of a swollen spine from compaction on a solid floor for 6 hours The compression in my lower spine shut off innervation of my nerves into my legs This 6 hours of compaction also compacted all the tissues in my body with contact to the solid ground This lead to something called Rhabdomyolysis This is the extremely high accumulation of dead cells within the body The typical person has anywhere between 50 250 u ml at any time A Calcium Klinaise blood panel CK just standing around doing nothing Athletes can get up to maybe 1 000 u ml after a strenuous workout Mine clocked in at 79 800 u ml at the ER They immediately began to F L U S H my body with saline 400 ml of fluids every hour in the ER Nuero comes in and tells me the situation ending it with warning me that I may never walk again This was all 5 days ago I m still alive I can wiggle my toes now and have full control over everything but my ankles essentially The rate of progress would suggest its only a matter of days or hours before I can work them fully I mostly can now But not entirely But it doesn t end there Remember at the beginning when I said I weigh 175 pounds That was 5 days ago I now 264 pounds I have a muffin top lol I m huge everywhere My dick got so thick I now have a foreskin again Turns out they overdid the saline treatment By a lot My CK is now in the normal range My kidneys are above average health I m ready to leave But they pumped so much fluids into me it s effecting my mobility My legs are so swollen I cant really move anything easily They admitted to over doing it so now they re giving me some kind of water pill diuretic that will make me lose all of these fluids in 48 hours Ultimately what I learned to respect from this is that lows are EXTREMELY dangerous More than I think I took seriously The cost could be death Also extremely severe is what you go through if you re lucky enough to live TLDR Severe Rhabdomyolysis from passing out from Hypoglycemia It s very very bad and the treatment is nearly just as bad

       "1752  Was I too harsh on my ex girlfriend about her diabetes My ex gf of 1 day has diabetes Prior to meeting her I had never met anyone with diabetes and didn t really know anything about it in fact I was one of those does that mean you can t eat sugar people But it didn t take long with some explaining by my ex for me to get an understanding of what living with t1 diabetes meant My ex was sort of at a point in her life where she was trying to get things back on the right track get away from the drugs and excessive partying and try to be more responsible about her future This was one thing I really appreciated about her and I could tell she was doing a lot of it for me But there was one thing that always bothered me about her and kind of had something to do with our eventual break up and that was how she handled her diabetes Within the first week of us sleeping together I experienced her having hypoglycemia and having to run to the store to buy sugar because I didn t have any food at home and she was suddenly literally blind that was the only time she said she lost vision However her having hypoglycemia was a frequent occurrence like almost daily at some point I would wake up to her alarm going off on her phone and she wouldn t move for minutes and remained sleeping When I d ask if her blood sugar levels were low she d deny it either annoyed or in a baby voice If I asked her to check it would be low and I d have to try to get her to take her grape tablets Well in a perfect scenario this is how it would go but usually what would happen is she would refuse to check her blood I d spend 15 minutes convincing her to do it herself or let me do it and then spend another half hour pleading with her to take a grape sugar tablet or something Things actually got better further into our relationship but it was always on my mind that she wasn t doing enough to take care of her diabetes I d often wonder at times when she was being especially playful or silly if her blood sugar levels were off and it was causing me a lot of stress The biggest thing for me was that she hadn t gone to the doctor to try to get a cgm or something Like to me I couldn t fathom why she wouldn t want a device that would relieve her from having to prick her fingers all day and that would guard her from dropping into dangerous levels It seemed like it would be a huge improvement in her quality of life and it would help me not have to worry about her diabetes all the time But she wasn t being proactive enough about it and I just couldn t understand and it frustrated me How can I be with someone who doesn t seem interested in having control of a lifelong condition that they have So in our last argument I brought it up and I said it had been bothering me for the longest time She got very offended and said I was being mean and selfish for telling her that her diabetes was a problem in the relationship I told her it wasn t the diabetes it was the way she was handling it but she wasn t listening she told me I didn t understand what it was like living with diabetes and that hypoglycemia and the unpredictable behavior that came with it was something that would be with her forever and it was unfair and cruel of me to use it against her Anyway I did some looking around on the web today and tried to put myself in her shoes because if I had t1 I d definitely want a modern cgm and app combination with bells and whistles to minimize my stress and care But unless I m completely mistaken the current cgms don t seem as modern as one would expect and it looks like a lot of people on this sub still prick their fingers and still have trouble controlling their glucose levels And it s making me wonder if I was wrong all along and that a gcm or something wouldn t actually have helped all that much and that she wasn t being as irresponsible and careless as I thought

       "1754  Flying with diabetesOk long story short I was flying from New Jersey to San Diego with United When we went to board they said there was no over head space for our bags so they had to be checked Fast forward to about an hour being on the plane I felt myself having high symptoms I check my blood sugar and it reads HI that s it So I know it s over 600 so I go for my bag under the seat and I can t find my insulin I start to panic a little and I tell my brother The guy sitting next to us mentioned that maybe they have insulin in the first aid kit So I go up to the attendant and ask hey do you guys have any insulin And she said yes I was shocked honestly She also said a doctor or nurse had to administrate it when she said that I m kinda rolling my eyes I ve been diabetic for 13 years I can give administrate my own god damn insulin So she gets the first aid kit turns out there is no insulin in there Great The person in front of me happens to have some novolog pens and he so kindly gives me one Now keep in mind those pens say single patient use only So they are calling doctors on the ground to determine how much insulin they should give me even though I already told them how much I usually take in this situation So they finally give me the ok to inject 10 units literally after an hour of having the insulin available Literally what I told them I usually do They monitor me for a little and finally it s 580 So I m like hey can I take the pen And they said the EMTs will have to decide So I get off the plane and EMTs are waiting there keep in mind I m completely fine So I tell them I don t need any assistance but I would like to take the pen with me considering it will be disposed of and unused It s the same insulin I use so I didn t see the issue plus I talked to the guy that have it to me and he said I could keep it I also offered to pay the co pay of the pen in which he declined The EMTs would not give me the ok and neither were the flight attendants So I m arguing with them back and forth and it was clear they were not going to give it back to me So I left pissed off Do I have a possible law suit Or do I have the right to be upset Please give me your

       "1819  Diabetes management with In LawsHi I m new to reddit and have never had a diabetes support network before I m hoping to find perspectives from other T1 s on coping with and managing expectations around Diabetes care with family I ve had T1 for 15 yrs and am married to the kindest most loving and helpful husband S O is super great and supportive with T1 He understands it we eat well culturally diversely and life is good I will add that his parents are kind loving humans who treat me with respect and none of the discussion to come is due to ill intention on their part Also We are an interracial family I am culturally Indian and that is it s own set of separate challenges The issues arise when with his parents who are a classic meat and potatoes American family They eat relatively unhealthy per diabetes standards lots of pasta rice cheese meat dairy not enough non starchy veg and it s been a challenge for me to speak up for my dietary needs They don t understand the effort diabetes takes and stress that comes with an unplanned food life Mostly his dad isn t interested in discussing food no curious about my diabetes needs They live in rural Maine where access to restaurants or other kinds of food is very limited except for you got it classic burger pizza joints I have attempted to communicate my needs and assist with meal planning even cooking meals for the whole family I ve tried bringing my own snacks along and requesting they stock the house with healthier snacks not just crackers cheese pretzels sausages I feel uncomfortable asking them to adjust their way of life for me but at the same time dread spending time with them when my FIL mocks my husband and I attempts to eat healthier lower carb and more vegetarian meal plan or any thing else that makes eating with diabetes easier It is stressful enough to manage my dietary requirements on vacation 2 7days away from home and it s made worse when their habits are so health wise and culturally different and they don t recognize or empathize the struggles I face My MIL is responsible for the food in the family and she tries to help buys sugar free ice cream or low sugar pie for example but at the end of the day they enjoy pasta and meat WITH bread on the side I mostly suck it up and eat what is served trying to avoid overloading the carbs It hurts my feelings as if they don t care enough about my dietary needs and it extends to me feeling I am uncared for unloved Is it ok to request to eat separate meals Or request they modify their diet a little for the few times a year we spend together This situation is damaging my relationship with them and I am so bitter and resentful My husband recently brought this up with his parents and they were extremely offended saying I was insulting the way they eat and their way of life They didn t at all validate or understand the challenges that come with living and eating with diabetes It s extra challenging because they are my in laws not my parents and are not required to love me in the same way Has anyone else experienced this Feeling unsupported by family How can I help my in laws understand and care about my diabetes when we are together Any ideas would be great at this emotionally challenging time Love

       "1976  Just want to vent feeling downHi My diabetes has been making me feel so wrecked recently I am seeing my endocrinologist on Monday but my insulin wont work like it used to as of a week ago I am taking double sometimes triple the needed dose to bring my blood glucose to where it needs to be Ive tried different batches of insulin I had to leave a friends birthday early tonight because I checked my blood glucose and it was randomly sky rocketing at 12 5mmol I dont want to go through a night of high sugars because the way I feel now it will make me way too sick And that gets me so down the fact I have to leave events for things like this because of a sugar level that wants to randomly jump up Its irritating because I measured my carbs I took the correct insulin dose I even took my long acting insulin and this should definitely keep my sugar level stable but no it sky rockets This whole week ive just felt disgustingly nauseous and swollen if that makes sense Some may think of ketones but ketones shouldnt affect the bodys ability to absorb insulin so how does it explain blood sugars that require almost three times the regular dose to come down The truth is I stupidly went on a keto diet 50g of carbs a day without any professional medical advice beforehand What I think happened is this I reduced my carb intake dramatically to the point where I was taking 6 units a day TOTAL of fiasp for meals and 15 units of tresiba Before keto I was taking 6 12 units of fiasp PER MEAL and 30 units of tresiba a night I was on the reduced insulin for 2 weeks while doing a keto diet and noticed my blood glucose going crazy when I had a cheat meal of a piece of naan bread with my food 2 weeks into the diet That is when I noticed my blood sugar would not go down when injecting the required amount of insulin I would usually need for this resulting in me having to dose three times the usual amount and now the same for each meal which has carbs in it In turn the large doses of insulin make me feel physically rough I have only ever had this problem once in my life and this was directly after a trip to Japan I returned home and my insulin would not work properly I saw my endocrinologist who was not sure why but had changed my humalog to fiasp and the fiasp worked for me Similarly to my situation now when I returned that time from Japan I had eaten a lot of food more than I would normally eat in a single meal in Japan and this triggered my insulin to stop working for some reason It has just made me feel so sick this week and I had a trial shift for a new job today and was ready to quit but stuck through it I got the job Just wondering if any other t1 diabetics have gone through this and what you think it might be Sometimes my diabetes gets me down but I remember all the diabetics who don t have access to medical care and it reminds me to remain humble and count my blessings but sometimes I just wish we could lift this weight off our shoulders Some

       "2258  Managing glucose during workoutOK this is gonna be a long one Usually when I exercise I tried to eat before my workouts and or take bolus shot I can manage my sugars with no insulin and or food if it s a light exercising but that s another story Now I have moderate high intensity workouts for about 2 hours later in the evening when my insulin sensitivity is quite high I am also now on a slight calorie deficit or maintaining daily amount but surely try to avoid surplus weight increase That being said I particularly cut the carbs try to consume about 80g of carbs at most that s including low s With this diet I am used to it have done it before my glucose levels are quite stable and in the range 80 130mg dl through the day Next before I start my workout warm up phase is about 30 40 minutes in 50 80 HR zones my glucose is in the range of 110 125mg dl Plus I have not consumed any carbs for at least last 3 hours before the workout After the warm up 40 minutes my glucose is already about 180mg dl So the question is how to deal with this hoping to get some scientific info behind too And why it is increasing I pose these questions because usually if my glucose is in the range 80 130mg dl and I do light exercising 50 70 HR it keeps dropping and I need to eat something So ok maybe in this case since I am in the 70 80 HR zone and sometimes for short periods of time even above 80 the glucose starts increasing because I reach anaerobic state that requires more glucose for energy compared to low level exercising Does it increase because I have not had any carbs for a while and the body starts to consume stored reserves for energy And since I have not had any bolus the body delivers glucose to bloodstream but it is not delivered because there is no insulin to deal with it Does this sound right But now the next question If I take a bolus shot 2 units some 40 minutes before the workout without any snack will the glucose remain relatively stable of course it will not be perfect but considering that timing is right etc Or in this case because of the bolus shot it will simply start to drop since bolus is injected it keeps delivering glucose from blood to cells and my sugar level drops BUT since there is insulin present that delivers glucose to cells my body does not trigger release from the stored reserves and I end up with a hypo I am not sure about science behind this one Yes I have a sensor yes I can take a time out and have a snack if my glucose drops yes I can also have a snack and shot before the workout regardless etc But my goal is to cut some weight necessary for sport plus ending up with a low is quite annoying because taking a snack complicates everything during my workouts I also want too avoid snacking before during workout because it s more difficult to manage my glucose anyway in this case and I may end up with a higher glucose reading than those 180mg dl and then again I have no energy am out of breath soon and my workout is shit I hope to get some feedback based on experiences and or scientific material to read that may explain this particular case in detail amp x200B P S After those 40 minutes of warm up when my sugar has increased to 180mg dl it starts dropping again typical for me during long aerobic types of exercises but still during this rise at first I feel that I lack energy at some point So how to have energy without going LO HI and avoiding eating carbs If that is possible at all

       "2337  Experimenting with basal insulinWondering is there any research or information about manipulating the dosage of basal insulin I know many will say that I should not do that but I am quite experienced with all the diabetes stuff and not afraid to try OK I do exercise a lot I have cut my insulin dosages down to 30 of prescribed daily amounts this has nothing to do with rationing it s just my weird obsession of being healthy and avoid injections as much as possible Since my workouts are very demanding and I want to make very workout effective I have started a new approach how to deal with managing glucose levels during the workout taking large amounts of basal insulin I was originally prescribed 24 units used to use 14 units due to my exercising and diet now I use 30 40 units per day Why do I do this I learned that higher amounts of basal insulin lower the glucose relatively rapidly if the dosage is high increase sensitivity towards rapid acting insulin ok maybe not sensitivity just their interaction causes glucose to drop in the long run through the day glucose levels drop after each meal and I feel that cells receive energy even though at first glucose may be high this is basically the main reason with high dosages of basal insulin I can still perform well during my workouts even if my glucose level is quite high higher while with managing glucose with rapid insulin before during workout is more complicated those who exercise know what I am talking about you can follow the same pattern but glucose will be different any different day Besides taking high basal dosages help me to sleep during the night even if glucose is high 300 I d not need to wake up several times a night to go to bathroom whereas if I take my regular decreased basal dosage and manage glucose level with rapid insulin I must wake up and go to bathroom even if my glucose is only 130 I have had serious problems with sleep and it is very important for me to have a rest therefore I gladly use this option So finally the question what are effects of this type of experimenting that I do Does using very high dosages of basal can lead to some problems complications in general like increased insulin resistance and stuff Does the state when my glucose level is around let s say 300 while on a high dosage of basal affect my kidney s liver caterpillars eyes neural nervous system etc This part I find kinda hilarious because I mean if the sugar is 300 then surely body wants to get rid of it and that should be stress on all organs that deal with getting it out of the system but then why I have no need to go to pee in this case I tried to research but did not find anything that could give any insight how mad normal it is to do something like that If someone can explain and state facts why this is really bad for my health I can quit it immediately but so far I do not see any reason to stop this experimenting I can still manage my glucose with rapid insulin but it is more inconvenient and especially more difficult in the mornings when insulin resistance is higher dawn effect or whatever etc and in general I feel weaker while on a high basal dosage I feel quite excellent P S I know about dangers taking such high dosage before night and hypo s that can occur but I can manage that easily P P S Disclaimer I have type 1 for 22 years since my childhood so I have a hold of this but I highly do not recommend to follow this pattern to anyone here who does not have EXCELLENT understanding in managing diabetes dieting and others affects that can trigger high s or low s

       "2363  I m stumpedI apologize in advance for the long post Some background Last A1C 7 4 Diagnosed 9 years ago 17F Have severe anxiety have been on birth control for the past four months I don t know if these affect things I use the Medtronic 670g with the sensor Humalog insulin 5 5 and 150 lbs my weight rarely fluctuates but recently I ve dropped to about 146 I eat a relatively healthy diet minimal carbs try to fill my plate with proteins and low carb fruits veggies but I will have half a cup of brown rice or a slice of whole wheat bread regularly I also eat dairy Very active lifestyle So I just finished a season of drum corps and am starting marching band Both pretty physical activities drum corps we spent upwards of 12 hours rehearsing in the sun each day Towards the end of season about two weeks ago I began getting lightheaded dizzy during rehearsals I would also get stomach cramps after eating and very nauseous throughout the day I had to go to urgent care for it and after checking my out they found nothing wrong I d checked my ketones and they were never above 0 2 I figured the trace amounts were just the burning of fat from the constant physical activity After getting back it seemed to have gotten better but the first day of band about an hour into rehearsal I got extremely nauseous and dizzy On my way to the nurse I ran into her and she told me that I was extremely pale and my lips were white My vision went blurry and o had to sit I was better after sitting down some time Of course she pulled me out of band and said I needed to go to the doctor before coming back so I did At the time I went to the nurse my glucose was 169 About two hours after when I was at the doctors my blood sugar had risen to 300 Doctor took my blood checked everything else and I seemed fine but have to wait for lab results I came home checked my ketones and I was at 0 4 so I drank a ton of water and tried to flush them Later my blood sugar is 182 and my ketones are at 0 8 Cue more insulin and water Then they drop to 0 3 Blood sugar is still around 180 About two hours later I check before bed and my blood sugars steadily rising to 200 and not responding to insulin corrections I check ketones and it s 1 2 Eventually I just decided to inject about six units of insulin I d been using my pump prior and drink another bottle of water My blood sugar finally drops I wake up and it s at 59 But MY KETONES ARE STILL AT 0 7 At this point I just said fuck it and went about my day I m still very nauseous and dizzy and while I was allowed back to band I had to sit out a lot The doctor calls back and apparently everything is completely fine we have to ask for my A1C tomorrow cause they didn t tell us besides my high blood sugar I don t know why I feel so sick still and it s extremely frustrating My blood sugar also is right back to 270 right as I wanted to sleep It was 190 before dinner vegetarian sushi and roughly below 150 the entire day before that I ve tried calling my endo but had to talk to a different one from the hospital who just gave the stock drink water and give insulin stuff and didn t read into any of my other symptoms I m hoping maybe other diabetics might recognize something This is very frustrating especially with my mother being the kind of person who just believes everything off the internet and keeps accusing me of not having good control or saying I have DKA or something Pretty sure if I had DKA for two weeks straight I d be dead

       "2566  Fasting ketosis and reducing insulin HELP Hi I m looking for advice on longer term fasting safely getting into ketosis I m in the US so using freedom units On my phone so please excuse autocorrect typos Will edit with conversions and for grammar when I get to my computer later today History and disclaimers before you yell at me I ve been type 1 for 4 5 years and am a very research driven person so am trying to be careful and gather a sh t ton of anecdotal peer reviewed tips before I do something stupid and hurt myself I have a Dexcom G6 which is my greatest love in this world and keeps me sane and safe I have pretty awesome control especially recently as I get my mental health and other physical health issues under control recent a1c of 5 7 with very few lows which is insane progress for me but as I exercise more I m finding myself having to lower my basal and still eat 75g of carbs with no bolus just to stay afloat sometimes My endo and I have discussed that this could be solved by switching to a pump from MDI so I can suspend my basal as needed but insurance problems are slowing this process down And yes I am in frequent contact with my endo and am going back to meet in person in 2 weeks which is why I want to do my own research now so I can bring it to our next discussion Right now improvement with my bg numbers isn t my primary goal as I am finally happy with where I am for the most part I am interested in keto though as maybe if I switch to fat burning for fuel I will avoid the occasional necessity of eating so many carbs Anyone have experience with this as a T1d I ve read some about this but have specific questions if you re willing to share how long did it take to get into ketosis How low did does your blood sugar get before you get into ketosis Have you gone low going into ketosis and have you figured out how to avoid this I have intermittent fasted in the past 20 4 OMAD and am very interested in doing a longer fast 5 days and as diabetes allows of course for the benefits of autophagy for other health issues Has anyone done this I have found a grand total of one peer reviewed study on T1Ds doing 24 hour fasts but I d love to hear from you I ve reduced my basal so much at this point because of exercise I feel like I genuinely would need to stop using it to avoid hypos assuming I started fasting at a reasonable bg maybe 150 Again I m guesstimating based on previous experience with intermittent fasting I don t want to stop my basal completely without doing a shit ton of research and talking with my endo of course This seems crazy to me I ve historically been the person who struggles with highs more than lows but now that I m exercising a lot more I m eating and eating carbs to just stay around 100 Suspending basal is normal though for you pump users right So theoretically if I truly didn t need insulin on a fast I could be okay Or does this still put me at risk for DKA even with in range blood sugars and with a proper and careful refeed to ensure blood sugars don t spike while in ketosis I guess this is a brain dump for me as much as it is asking for help I d love to hear a your thoughts on the mess my brain has left above b your experience with t1d keto and or fasting of any type and c if you feel the need to yell at me for considering getting rid of my basal please do but please back it up with sources because I m having such a hard time finding them myself Thank you thank you thank you and much love This subreddit has saved me in many ways and I deeply appreciate you and am grateful to be a

       "2662  My thoughts on looping with omnipod dexcom g6 Hey there fellow insulin addicts I m a longtime lurker and wanted to share my experience with looping I ll break it down as simple as possible ___________________________________________ Devices iPhone X Omnipod w Riley Link Dexcom G6 ___________________________________________ History I am an active 23 y o and have had t1d for 7 years now I ve always kept my bloodsugar somewhat under control having an A1C in the 7 s Not the best not the worst I had an endo appointment before I started looping and had a nightmarish 7 9 A1C Luckily for me I had the riley link coming to my door step soon it takes over a month to get the riley link ___________________________________________ Setup The setup is the hardest part You ll need to have a handle on scripting in the MacOS terminal PM for help I m somewhat of a computer nerd If you re a non Mac user the process gets even harder You ll need to learn how to download and install the latest version of MacOS on a virtual machine VM to install the loop app on your iPhone once again feel free to PM me for help You re going to run into errors and it s going to take way more time than you d like to get this baby purring ___________________________________________ Immediate Thoughts on Looping If I had to rate the system I d give it a 5 5 any day of the week I ve been looping for over a month now and am almost always in the 90 120mg dL range its absolutely incredible I ve managed to get my A1C down to 6 4 in just one month The beauty of looping is that the software constantly has eyes on your bloodsugar and will increase decrease basal rates accordingly Like the omnipod it will recommend bolus looping bolus is more accurate than omnipod bolus though to fix bloodsugar An amazing feature of the loop app is having high and low boundaries you can tell the app to keep you between 75mg dL 120mg dL and it does a fine job doing that Possibly the most black magic part of the whole system you ll need to find your insulin sensitivities link with guide on setting that up https kdisimone github io looptips settings settings 3rd insulin sensitivity factor Insulin sensitity is the most important part of looping that can be overshadowed it runs the whole show ___________________________________________ Final Thoughts To me the worst part about being t1d is waking up to high or low bloodsugar and having to take care of it inevitably it will make you feel off Since looping I ve been waking up to 100mg dL every single day and never shooting up or down throughout my day I feel incredible I never go to bed wondering if I m going to wake up in extreme ranges I recommend this non FDA approved system to anyone who wants to have their diabetes stablized and improved while putting in less effort than before ___________________________________________ Notable links Loop Website https loopkit github io loopdocs Facebook Page https www facebook com

       "2754  Need to upgrade pump Dealing with Minimed and the 670G systemFirst some context I am a 27 year old female T1 diabetic I ve had T1 since I was 2 years old so essentially it is just part of my life Current A1C is 6 8 am using a Medtronic PARADIGM 530G and Dexcom G6 CGM Paradigm is now out of warranty and conveniently failed at the beginning of the month so I am currently on a Minimed loaner Paradigm I guess this is more of a vent of dealing with Minimed and also looking for advice of how to deal with them in the future given my situation amp x200B First call to Minimed Unfortunately my insurance United Healthcare is pals with Minimed and won t let me go for the t Slim x2 like I wanted So I am stuck with upgrading with Minimed yet again Since getting the loaner pump they have been blowing up my phone texting me calling me emailing me and CALLING MY MOM to upgrade my pump This is while I m looking at my options surprise Lol United gives you none and maybe a week after receiving the loaner you get a 3 month period with it before you get slapped with a charge amp x200B I get back to them and the woman I m working with says Oh by the way your phone goes straight to voicemail YES because you ve left me 2 messages today Anyways I give them my insurance info they tell me they will check with my insurance to make sure the pump is covered I say okay and assume they will get back to me to let me know what is covered Surprise again I just get an email saying that I owe nothing good and that the pump in the shipping queue So guess I am stuck with it Fine whatever amp x200B Second call to Minimed I m a little upset to see that the pump is in the shipping queue without them talking to me first and I just re upped on Dexcom G6 supplies and Minimed wants to send the Guardian sensor to me either A When the warranty on the G6 runs out 3 months the first associate wanted me to get back to them with the dates of expiration so they could send the Guardian out after or according to this second call associate B They want to pay me 200 to switch immediately and I would pay 100 out of pocket for the Guardian This associate is pressing me to take option and saying they don t like to ship the pump and sensor separately I convince him that to just send the pump and say I ll get back to them with the date of expiration because no way am I paying 100 for the Guardian after just paying 100 for the Dexcom refill amp x200B The real issue I don t want the Guardian sensor just the pump I want to continue treatment with the Dexcom G6 which I have used since October and love I have had the CGM Minimed put out with the Paradigm little over 4 years ago and absolutely hated it Waking up in the middle of the night to deal with incorrect readings calibrating constantly the sensor kinking under my skin the list goes on and on I see that other people are STILL having these issues with the Guardian 3 and I don t trust it enough to relay info to the pump that will change my insulin rates No thanks don t want to be stuck with a subpar product for a year when I have the best luck with the G6 amp x200B How do you convince MiniMed that you DO NOT want the Guardian sensor and will use the pump in its basic functions I really just want an insulin pump They can t force me to take the Guardian right Do I reaaaaallly have to go to training for the pump and CGM Does anyone have positive experience with the Guardian sensor or have had both the G6 and Guardian Tl dr How do you deal with Minimed pressing you to get the Guardian sensor when you absolutely don t want it and are happy with the Dexcom and using the 670G pump Does anyone have similar experiences

       "2846  WTF am I doing wrong with my G6 I ve had the last 3 go bad on me One of them without ever warming up I m new to the G6 and after 4 years of G4 sensor perfection never had one go bad in first 7 days i m a little discouraged I ve been a tSlim user for 2 3 months now and really like the G6 s near perfect accuracy the suspend function on the tSlim has kept me alive and sleeping very well I love the system when it works The last 3 sensors stopped without any notification Just stopped One minute I have a data stream next time I look nothing Just a trend line gap No notifications no alarms no notices of any kind The CGM History just says Sensor Stopped and the time Like i pressed the stop button One sensor lasted 4 days another died during warm up that one did give me a failure error and this last one another 2 days First 2 were in my arm and was the first time i ve put them there the last one was in my stomach where I ve been wearing the G6 for 2 months problem free and used the G4 for 4 years without a hitch I d like to give the arm another try and rest my gut but maybe not The situations where they failed have no commonality Once out walking once sitting reading to my kid before bedtime and once out eating 2 different Lots I do not use the Dexcom iPhone app It s been on my phone and occasionally hooked into the sensor but my Bluetooth is usually off That s because with the tSlim i m getting double notifications There is no real gain to using the app I ll just download the data manually But it would lock onto it a few times a day randomly I do not think that cycle impacted this I gently brush the applicator pad in Mastisol prior to insertion But i m careful to not get it around the wire or insertion site itself there should be no impact or effect from it FWIW I tried to restart them a variety of ways even by putting my tSlim in a Faraday bag for a couple of hours No use the sensors were dead This is frustrating as shit Dexcom agreed to send me new ones but still this is no way to manage care I m about to go back to the G5 and just use my phone The suspend on the tSlim works great but i ll just set alarms and wake myself and my wife up again the endless cycle of calling customer support to get replacements filled is cumbersome and annoying The G4 worked perfectly for 4 years and up to 17 days at a time I cannot believe this is an improvement I read the posts and know I m not alone with sensor failures Reddit users are a small part of the overall T1 community so I can only imagine the failure rate of these things But still 3 in a row from different lots The math makes it improbable I feel like i m doing something wrong If anyone has any history like this and identified an issue with the tSlim or G6 that i m missing please let me know

       "3047  Recently started on Tresiba not sure how it works Hey Context I m a 23 y o T1D since 1998 age 2 on Freestyle Libre CGM injecting Fiasp at breakfast lunch and dinner and now since saturday Tresiba new long acting insuline degludec around 10pm Before that I ve used most of my life glargine long acting insuline Lantus but had issues with it not lasting the promised 24 hours and thus having spikes at the end of the afternoon before dinner so my endo recommended Tresiba which is supposed to last around 40 hours while still taken daily don t really know how they made it so the doses don t stack up but that s irrelevant I guess Doubt that s relevant but I m also currently taking 150 200mg a day of Alprazolam and Venlafaxine once a day and had been before the switch to Tresiba with no change in my BS except less stress spikes Other tidbit is that I m living in France and this recent switch to Tresiba unfortunately coincides with the super heat wave we re having right now so maybe that s related My problem is that I basically don t get how this new insulin works at all My endo said the conversion Lantus to Tresiba should be roughly 1 1 but to err on the safe side at first I have the 200u ml pen version since that was not super clear and neither my endo nor my pharmacist acknowledged that there exists 2 versions 100u ml pens like with Lantus and this 200u ml when I first tested it on saturday I injected around half my usual Lantus dose 18 so 10 of Tresiba just to be safe It was a disaster and I massively spiked at the end of the night and had to correct in the morning No other spikes during the day So the next night I tried with 14u and had exactly the same results Next night tried 18u and still massive spike in the morning Now I ve read that dose adjustments with Tresiba may take up to 3 days to be fully effective but I ve already injected 18u for the last three days and there s still absolutely no difference compared to the first day when I tried 10 My BS is relatively stable around 120 150 before bed and till 4am then spikes super quickly and I wake around 8 or 9am at 300 400 With Lantus it was the opposite as my BS used to go down a bit 70 80 around 6 7am before dawn effect took over It feels like there s somewhat a long acting insulin in effect during the day because other than correcting for the morning spike I ve had no need to adjust any other Fiasp dose during the day Except I still have the same spikes at the end of the afternoon that I had with Lantus Basically I m completely lost I have no idea why I spike like that during the night with this Tresiba and going from 10u to 18u seemed to have no effect at all neither with the morning spikes nor with the rest of the day What s happening Could the heat affect the insulin in the pen I keep my pens in my room once opened and not in the fridge but never had any heat related issue with any kind of insulin before Is Tresiba more sensitive to heat Has anyone switched from Lantus to Tresiba and had similar issues

       "3054  Dexcom rantI just really need to rant to a community that understands this stress I ve had the g6 for 3 months When I needed to do my first reorder of sensors they were on backorder and dexcom could not put in the request because they needed to do a pre authorization After only a month They so graciously overnighted them once the authorization came in so I didn t run out and I thought wow they re great My second month of reordering came around and I wanted to call way ahead of time to make sure I would get them even with a backorder and the time it takes to ship 5 7 business days They said they couldn t put the order in yet so it would take another week This would put me on my third sensor As we all know sensors last 10 days So by the time I can order I SHOULD get my sensors but there was a 10 day backorder convenient Again they so graciously decided to overnight me 1 free sensor and my month supply once the backorder was fixed My third month of reordering I cannot get ahold of my representative I called everyday for 5 days so I decided to call customer support They tell me they ve taken note of all of my calls cool but they don t call me back and then tell me they can t reorder more sensors until my signed prescription is sent back to them form my doctor I m confused and frustrated because I had just given them a prescription 3 months ago They don t have that one on file they have the prescription for the g5 which I never bought because I couldn t afford it that was sent to them a year ago Still confused I ask how they ve been sending me supplies for a g6 when that prescription is for a g5 and they try to tell me it was written for both Well I again ask for an overnight as soon as they get the prescription back I called them and my doctors for 3 days before they receive it and to my surprise they re on backorder However after they receive the prescription they tell me I still have one order left on my old prescription that they will send immediately couldn t have told me the first time I tell them along with this purchase I need a new transmitter I notice in the invoice they didn t put the transmitter in the order so I call my representative and again no answer so I call customer support They tell me they need chartwork from my doctor of my blood sugars last month I tell them I don t have documentation of my blood sugar because I ve been on the g6 They tell me no problem just have the dr notate that and it should be fine So I ve called the dr office everyday and they keep telling me they haven t received it I resort back to dexcom TODAY and they say they ve sent the request on the 21st 24th and today They also failed to mention but brought it up today that I need to have bloodwork done too in order to allow them to submit and order Blood work of what I just had it done 3 months ago So I m furious I needed to change my sensor yesterday so I do I go to put in the sensor code and then it asked for my new transmitter code Confused I put in the same code of my old transmitter hoping it ll work until I get the new one Nope not the case So now I have wasted 60 on a sensor and who knows when I ll get this transmitter I finally contacted Costco and will be paying full price for a transmitter because dexcom fucking sucks Luckily they have a rebate at the moment and the transmitter is almost have it s

       "3144  Recently diagnosed T1 Living in a 3rd world country with limited options Advice regarding medical apparatus needed Hi reddit I was diagnosed with t1 about 2 months ago Been treating it with the help of a doctor and insulin with decent results blood sugars down from 350 during diagnosis around 70 120 working slowly towards the sweet spot of 83 Had some unpleasant lows on the way but hey its a learning process right My situation shortly The 3rd world country where I live in has only one company for medical apparatus related to diabetes MedTronic I am trialing their insulin pump 630G for about a week now and the thing is amazing Every time I get to sit down for a meal and have to push a few buttons instead of injecting insulin manually I feel very happy Nothing bad to say about the pump However the constant blood glucose monitor from MedTronic believe its called Guardian Connect the one that works with the 630G anyway is a little bit less impressive I like the suspend on low feature a lot just wish the monitor was a bit more accurate MedTronic rep suggested I look into getting the newer 670G from my home country about 10 hours flight away I visit once or twice annually as its a newer model and might be cheaper there the country where I live in taxes diabetes apparatus highly From what I understood there is also a better CGM from MedTronic out there using a newer sensor Guardian 3 the one Im using with the 630G is the older model from I understood Wouldnt mind making the switch to that if its better than the Guardian Connect 630G combo ANYWAYS A few things I was hoping I could get answers to 1 Is it convenient to buy the newer version of the pump 670G from my home country and use it where I live about 10 000 kms away How often are you guys needing replacements for the pump how often do they break down etc I do have support from MedTronic in the country where I live in now as in spare parts etc but if I needed a new pump in case the old 670G breaks down that would take time I assume 2 weeks or so MedTronic said they can give me a replacement pump if that happens would be a 630G I assume and that they can find a way to send the general spare parts needed for the pump and monitor sensors etc to the country where I live in so that shouldnt be an issue 2 How much of an improvement is the Guardian 3 sensor from the CGM sensor that works together with the 630G How much of an improvement is the 670G from the 630G I read that 670G should be more automated and can increase basal if sugars look high which I like Ive read some mixed reviews on reddit about the 670G though 3 Is it silly to buy a pump that has no support in the country I live in For example my home country has Omnipod for sale but the country where I live in has 0 support for it so Id have to fly 10 000 kilometres every time I want a new pump or more spare parts Guess that doesnt work out I wouldnt want to fly the distance more often than once every 6 months 4 How about using the 630G or 670G for pump but another CGM such as DexCom G6 How much am I missing out by not having the pump and the CGM work together as in how much am I missing out by not having the system adjust basal automatically Im not entirely sure if I can even buy a DexCom since in my home country Finland Omnipod and DexCom dont sell products to private patients directly and Im not entitled to healthcare in Finland anymor since Im not a resident So Im not sure if a doctor would even treat me assign the CGM for me even if I pay for it fully But I could look into it DexCom has no operations or support in the country I live in fwiw Insurance is not a consideration it will not pay anything for me in neither country So I will pay for all costs for pump and CGM and spare parts Money is not an issue I just want the best machines the best combination of a pump CGM I can get that is convenient for me Ive been talking with the MedTronic reps about the logistics of pulling this thing off but I dont expect to get non biased opinions from them would be good to hear what reddit thinks I think Im getting the hang of this diabetes thing pretty well just a few things I could use help with Thanks a lot in advance for replies

       "3453  my type 1 storyJust want to share my story because i feel like i can t share it with someone irl who understands I got diagnosed diabetes type 1 in 2013 when i was 22 At first it was a shock and this shock made me change some of my habits I read about alternative treatments such as changing your diet I went vegan ate mostly vegetables and raw i ate about 100 150g carbs a day My bloodsugar level was pretty good for a while and i was really confident I survived with no insulin for a while until suddenly from one to the other day my blood sugar level didn t go down how it did before So i started to take insulin again Because my bsl was good i started to eat more carbs and i needed to take more insulin In 2015 i left to travel asia europe with my ex girlfriend At that time i was used to take insulin before every meal and take the basis insulin daily Confronted with strangers almost every day getting invited for lunch dinner etc or just having a drink made me to be not so so consequent with taking the insulin At first i thought it s ok and it was ok for a while But it wasn t I didn t want to explain myself everytime when i have lunch or dinner with someone new I didn t accept the fact that i have diabetes and that i m bound to chemicals for the rest of my life i realised that only later And i m still not sure if i accepted it 100 Everytime i did something bad for my diabetes i thought no worries you gonna change these habbits sooner or later It s strange diabetes it s always here but you never really see it it s like a ghost you know there is something but only numbers tell you it s real I was travelling for about one and a half year The last 7 6 months i travelled alone and more than once i rewarded my self with sweets which i would never ate before diabetes because i thought now that i m alone and nobody sees it it doesn t count But it did When i arrived back home my first week i spent in the hospital because of a Ketoacidosis That was in fall 2017 Then i thought ok now i have to change I did for a while But then 2018 came summer came and i got accepted for art school I was checking my hba1c regularly and it was never really good around 10 11 I kept telling me i will change my habits and start to have a healthier life style soon I dont t talk about my bad levels with other people because i feel it will disconnect me from society or from social activities I m a student now i sit a lot I go out a lot drink a lot mostly beer There are less days in the week where i don t drink I take drugs at parties and come home early in the mornings or afternoons I don t have regular meal times sometimes i eat after midnight when i come home sometimes i eat almost nothing the whole day sometimes i m just snacking My blood sugar levels are a mess and i need a lot of insulin I don t count carbs or anything i just inject what i think is necessary Mostly i m wrong I haven t been to the doctor to check my hba1c lately cause i moved city Most people from my surroundings tend to drink a lot art students and i think alcohol is more or less a big problem in having diabetes under control When i m drunk i care less I was thinking about quitting alcohol but change to other substances like lsd micro dosing or so I don t know if it would be a good idea It s pretty clear what i should change But it s not easy It makes me sad makes me feeling helpless and i still pretend everything is fine Since a few months i have a small round spot in my sight It s getting a little bigger lately I m observing it I don t want to get blind It creeps me out I only talked to one of my friends about it I don t want to be the special case i just want to enjoy life like everyone else is doing around me But i can t I pretend i do enjoy but everytime i consume something food drinks etc i feel guilty It s a feeling which came with the diagnosis of type 1 i don t know what i expect on sharing this here but maybe it feels good to write it sorry for my english it s not my native tongue

       "3679  Advice for someone dating a t1 diabetic Hey guys I ve been debating making this post for a few weeks now This is a throwaway account since my SO might also be subscribed and I just want advice on how I could address this before I work up the courage to talk to them I don t want to worry them by being a worrywart myself and hovering They ve been so pleasantly surprised every time they ve caught me educating myself on type 1 I bought a book not long after we started dating and they caught me taking notes they were scrolling through my reddit I had no problem with this recently and were surprised to see I was subscribed to r diabetes I love them very much and want to do what I can to support them to encourage a healthy diet and active enough lifestyle to cheer them on to know what to do if they re ever in need of medical attention I m beginning to secretly really worry they may be in a slump as far as keeping their blood sugar below the high threshold they ve got on their pump Circumstances involving their future career have seemed to have gotten them very down and they tend to keep everything that s bothering them just bottled up until they re ready to burst I m afraid to pry because of my own insecurities worried irrationally that I ll have gone too far and prodded too much and just drive them away Also I m worried that my worrying will just make them feel even worse I m scared I m too nosey about it But I perk up instantly when their pump vibrates that their BG is too high And I feel ashamed but I peek when they pull it out to bolus and I keep seeing it in the 300s mg dL I m so worried I know it s not as bad as being too low but it s still bad and I don t know how to address it They were diagnosed over two years ago and it pains me to have educated myself on all of this and still be tentative about knowing what exactly is going on Don t you feel physically terrible when your BG is higher than 200 They seem ok they re not doing jumping jacks obviously but they don t let it stop them from spending time with me and being happy They ve gained some weight in recent months and I ve chalked it up to stress and to them just trying to keep up with me and be normal They love their fast food and their candy they get excited to share and binge with me And as much as I enjoy eating junk food and for the most part can get away with it with my metabolism being what it is and my job being rather physically strenuous I really want to have better habits so that we can get into a groove together I ve been gently shot down the few times I ve suggested it and like I said before my insecurities about overstepping boundaries keep me from just bringing it up I ve tentatively asked how their blood sugar has been hoping they know I mean how they ve been doing and how it s been going because they do seem to be very alone in that regard I m not aware of their receiving any support online and they don t see their endo very often But when I ve tried to casually bring up their BG they ve answered so shortly and carelessly that I ve worried I ve annoyed them by being nosey I ve resigned to just not bringing it up at all now and I cringe internally when I see them gorge on candies and not pull out their pump once Here in the last week they ve started kind of ignoring me when I wake them when their pump buzzes too I know they re sleepy and maybe I just don t fully wake them but my silly insecurities get the best of me yet again and I m afraid they re getting very tired of me insisting they check their pump and bolus in the middle of the night when it s woken me up I m never annoyed by it by any means Like I ve said countless times I just worry What would you do if your SO expressed worry about your levels Do you talk about it openly I ve even showed them funny t1d memes and I ve gotten mixed reactions that have made me so sad I just want to make it normal because it s a part of their life and it s never going away and it sucks and I just want to be here for them But I m so uncertain Thanks for any input sorry this is so long and especially sorry if this isn t really appropriate I just want to understand and to show them their wellbeing means a lot to me

       "3724  Witnessing diabetes from the other sideI wanted to share this story because it just happened today and I don t know if any type 1s have experienced this I work at a small town hardware store and we get a lot of elderly people who come in I got to work around 11 after going to my endo appointment I was watching the register while another coworker was at lunch and we were pretty slow during this time so there were maybe three people in the store I rang an older couple out they took their things and walked out Once they left an older gentleman walked by the register and was sort of grunting and walking a bit funny I kept my eye on him as he left but once he reached the door I had another customer come up to the counter I start ringing them out and the couple that I had checked out a minute ago come back in and tell me the gentleman had collapsed in the parking lot I paged for another coworker to come up front and help me out so we both go outside and see this guy on his back kind of rolling around I took my sweatshirt off and put it under his head We try asking a couple questions but he isn t responding so I called 911 I didn t see any bleeding but he looked very pale a familiar kind of pale I had a feeling in my gut he was diabetic but when I asked he didn t respond Where I live the fire department is literally across the street from the store I stayed on the phone with dispatch for a while as she asked me questions and finally hung up once she told me they were on the way We wait another 3 minutes or so until they arrive Once they get there they start asking questions and one question they asked was if he was a diabetic to which he said finally said yes They check his sugar and it was at 21 Once they said that my jaw dropped and I froze They got him up on the gurney and took him into the ambulance Once my coworker and I went inside I immediately started crying uncontrollably and headed for the bathroom I felt like I was looking at my future and it was terrifying I tried to pull myself together but I had to leave work for the day because I was so distraught I ve never witnessed another diabetic so critically low before They asked him if he gave himself insulin and he said yes and then they asked if he ate anything and he said he didn t know It made me think about growing old and being in situations like this I could have my diabetes under control but you can t fight old age and it really scared me My coworker texted me and told me the gentleman was okay and that he drove home after about 30 45 minutes in the ambulance I just needed to get this off my chest because it s been bothering me all day and I didn t know if anyone else has had experiences like this It was just overwhelming and hit me hard

       "3780  Just want to vent about my hospital stayJust a piece of background info Along with T1D I also have ankylosing spondylitis and am on Humira an immunosuppressant for it which makes me more susceptible to infections I ve had about two a year since I started it So I changed my pump omnipod on Sunday Monday and it was kind of irritated not unusual it was in for the whole three days when my doc has me prescribed for two because my body tends to reject them early Few days later it s more irritated and showing some signs of infection Wednesday it was even worse so I went to urgent care They said they were glad I came in when I did lanced it to add a gauze to help drain it and got me an rx for antibiotics The next day it was worse and I was dizzy and nauseas went back to urgent care who then sent me to the ER because they were worried about sepsis at this point I contacted my rheumatologist to clarify I should cease taking my immunosuppressant and ask how I should handle it She got back to me with instructions she has always allowed me to be a participant in my own care and has trusted my judgement when my care would also affect my diabetes At the hospital all is good in the ER no one concerned about my pump although I had to explain the infusion site became infected after I removed it and that my pump was not still at the infection site Once I was admitted I had to repeatedly clarify to the nurse what an insulin pump does vs a cgm This continued the entire time I also had to spell Ankylosing Spondylitis for her multiple times and clarify that just putting spondylosis as the diagnosis was not sufficient because AS is autoimmune and general spondylosis doesn t automatically mean that Luckily they let me keep my insulin pump and just keep a log that nobody looked at because none of the nurses understood diabetes or insulin pumps but again I had to clarify multiple times that no my pump was not still at the infection site I made it clear there was nothing wrong with my pump my infusion sites ect And this was an issue because I am immunosuppressed When I saw the doc he kind of questioned me more than necessary on my AS diagnosis because I m a girl more men are diagnosed with AS and because my diagnosis wasn t confirmed by radiology or gene testing Kind of annoying but I am used to my diabetes being the scapegoat of all my problems so I was just happy he was focusing on the disease that actually caused the issue and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just interested Yesterday while waiting 7 hours to be discharged they sent in a diabetes educator without informing me beforehand She woke me up and started grilling me She was trying to make this an issue about how I manage my insulin pump She tried to insist there was some problem with how I use my pump to explain the infection trying to suggest things like I need to use skin tac wipes which I have had reactions to She didn t ask me what I thought happened or how I manage my pump I have been on a pump for 12 years I just felt blindsided I just reaffirmed there were no issues with my pump and that it was my immunosuppressant and I ve already been in contact with my rheum I will say I m lucky that my endo is also type one so he has always understood and has always respected the fact that I am the expert on my own individual experience with diabetes It s just annoying when you have people who know very little trying to lecture you because you re in the hospital for a tangently related issue TL DR Was in the hospital for an infection from my infusion site because I am immunosuppressed to treat my ankylosing spondylitis nurses didn t know the difference between a pump and a cgm and they surprised me with a diabetes educator trying to blame my pump management for the infection

       "3852  This shit never happened to me beforeAt first sorry for my english I am from Austria and I do my best I am also on my phone so sorry about the formatting A few things about me I am 19 years old and I suffer from diabetes t1 for 15 years I have a pump since I was 10 I guess At fist I had a medtronic pump but I got a ypsomed pump last year bc it s not that big and you can connect it to your phone and other benefits I use a steel catheter since the plastic ones always bend hence I always had a leaking catheter and my bloodsugar was high But the steel ones are great I don t feel them in my body and my blood sugar is great since then Now about the little fuck up Last Friday I was in Vienna and got really hungry so I ordered fast food and ate it Me being a dumb lazy idiot I forgot to inject the insulin So after an hour I felt that my blood sugar was high and I corrected my mistake After half an hour I felt it was still pretty high don t worry I also checked my blood sugar level and I injected another dosis of insulin But nothing changed I thought it was normal since I ate a lot and normally my body needs to calm down after being on a high glucose level Later me and my gf decided to go and get some food so I drove to the mall and bevor I went into the restaurant I checked my blood sugar which is still high af I know I should have considered it before but now was the time I had to change the catheter I was angry bc I rarely need that long to get a decent glucose level I put a new catheter in and removed the old one I almost got a heart attack bc the plastic on the catheter was fine but the 9 mm needle wasn t attached to the plastic anymore I pressed on the part of my body where the catheter originally was and I felt an unpleasant pain I still had no panic since my gf was next to me but if she wasn t here I would have screamed and cried bc I was so scared So I drove to the hospital and they tried to pull this 9 mm thing out of my body They cut a piece of my skin out searched for it and finally after 20 minutes they managed to show me the needle Now I am sitting here one week later with a healing scar and praying that I never ever have to experience this shit again I guess it was a production problem but it still scares me to think about that this could happen again Again sorry for my English I just wanted to tell you about this situation and I can t give you any advice Just take care of yourself and check your catheters

       "3881  Game changer for the very active type 1It was suggested of me to cross post this here I originally posted it in the bjj forum since I m a grappler and type 1 since the age of 6 years old and I m currently turning 38 this weekend Going to pasta my post now In threads in the past I have had conversations with members about CGMs and how the pump etc was not an option for me as I cant keep a sensor or port in to save my life They always pulled out no matter how well I wrapped and taped them to my body so I gave up and did it the old fashioned way Finger sticks and shots Last week I got the Eversense CGM implant and it is the real deal They implant a sensor in the form of a capsule chip under the skin and then place the transmittor on the skin which sends the readings to an app on my phone Best part is that I can slap a new adhesive on after training everyday and it wont break the bank the way a traditional CGM would as insurance only covers one sensor per week They give 100 adhesive patches per 3 month period and buying more patches isnt very costly at all This is seriously one of the best things to happen for active diabetics especially those of us who grapple I have been training for many years and this has been a godsend for me When I train I take the transmitter off when I m done training I put it right back on Easy as that for a cgm I don t have to worry about covering anything when training or fear people grabbing it when they grab my gi etc I know Im leaving some detailed shit out but go research it and see if your insurance will cover it The insurance plan I have through my wife covers the sensor however I am in a different state at the time so my the had to contract with a local BCBS plan that unfortunately doesnt cover the system Luckily the Eversense has a bridge program that cuts the costs down TREMENDOUSLY to only about 99 for a three month insertion and you get three insertions for a total of 300 for 9 months of CGM During that time they can try to help you get it covered and theyll work your insurance I believe A plus is that one of the reps has trained BJJ so they understand what its like to deal with this shit Customer service has been great with them and they are calling to check up on me daily to answer any questions or to see if Im having any issues Im not getting paid nor do I work for or affiliate with the company but as I said this is a big deal for me and my care Hopefully it can help someone else out who is in the same place I have been in for the past 12 years when it comes to bjj and grappling Ive been type 1 since I was about 6 years old I normally test between 6 12x per day and today I only poked my fingers 2x for the daily calibration https www eversensediabetes com patient education Accessories

       "3906  Held HostageAm I alone in feeling like I am being held hostage by the doctors I don t need to see a doctor Nothing is wrong Nothing has changed They are going to say the exact same things they have always said Even the A1c is going to come back the same or extremely similar But they won t renew my rx unless they get their 70 co pay every month Seriously If feels like my life in exchange for my money I am being held hostage at syringe point If it was a random person on the street threatening to choke me to death and deny me the air I need to breathe in exchange for money I would be screaming for police and justice But it s a doctor and this is a medical condition so it must be ok for them to do this right But I don t want a doctor controlling my life for the rest of my life I don t want doctors telling me to get more exercise drink more water control my stress levels get more sleep and otherwise just be god damn well perfect all the fucking time Test more Eat less carbs Yak yak yak the fucking know it all perfect life no stress fucking doctors who apparently forget I don t live in a vacuum and life happens no matter what And it ends no matter what I try I do my best But my toddler has no idea why mommy suddenly gets angry and has to stop and eat and can t play for the next hour while I try to recover and stabilize So I ve had my targets a bit higher than normal so I don t scream at my toddler to leave me alone so I can focus on finding the skittles and not having a seizure and finding the phone to call someone in case I suddenly need an ambulance And that I am trading my long term health so my toddler doesn t need therapy for the rest of her life bc mommy seems to be totally bipolar And instead of listening to me and trying to help I m told to do better and balance my activity and food and stress better Bc that s really helpful I just need someone to tell me that it is ok That I am not a shitty mom That my toddler is going to survive my lows and it s going to be worth it to keep putting up with this diabetic shit day in and day out for the rest of my life I m just having a super shitty day and need some support Bc when your toddler hugs you while you have an anxiety attack saying mommy feel better ladies and gents I feel like shit right now It was the sweetest thing ever And all I want to do is go crawl in a hole and cry so she doesn t see me crying and doesn t see how sad mommy gets bc of this diabetic shit And my little girl shouldn t have to be careful where she touches me bc of my pump and infusion site

want to explain how I do it just in case it helps some one else First and foremost use an area that has lots of fat Second look for veins They appear blue green and you must keep the infusion catheter from hitting them Third rotate your locations as much as possible For me there are only two places I can wear a pod successfully my left and right abdominal fat roll Anywhere else ends in tears high blood sugar Do not overfill the Omnipod No more than 200 Units even though it can take a bit more If possible allow the insulin to warm to room temperature before filling it If I have to do an emergency change I warm the insulin bottle with both hands Do not take off the cap until after priming is done Gently flick the insulin in the insertion window out of the pod after priming and removing the cap Peel one of the bottom stickers part way then pull the other sticker off the whole way then pull the first off the rest of the way Place the pod on the body Avoid getting too close to the belly button Take a picture or closely examine the injection window Note the inner shape of the plastic and how much insulin is stuck to it With one hand pinch the roll of fat under the pod as deep as possible The goal is to bring up the pod without causing tension on the skin it is attached to In other words bring up the skin but don t pinch it With the other hand start the pod and then immediately press down on the pod so that is is pushed gently into the skin I try to make the skin look flat instead of bubbled at the top There is a random amount of time after you hear the pump clicking before you hear the snap of the cannula being inserted Note the amount of pain you felt Pain is not necessarily a bad thing but can sometimes indicate that you struck a vein Look at the top of the pod and make sure the little thin area window shows pink I ve never had that fail Look at or take a picture of the insertion window and make sure the cannula is properly entering your skin Take your first bolus I always change out before breakfast so I take around 10 units with my cereal After the pump is done clicking take another picture of your insertion window and note if the shape of the liquid in the plastic has changed if there are more or less bubbles of insulin or literally any change at all If anything is significantly different the insulin may not be going into you Also have someone who cares give it the sniff test The amount of insulin will be very little and the amount of smell associated with a well installed pod will be learnable Your family friends will be able to tell you if the smell is too strong because the insulin is leaking under the pod into the adhesive

       "3984  rambling garbage positive amp negative read it if you are bored ignore it if its too long and unfocused thanks to the continual improvement of technology and the growth of knowledge via research I have been able to evade natural selection having been diagnosed 37 years ago I have been through many stages of engagement in my own health acceptance resistance denial success failure I have seen many technologies come and go and I have relied on the grace of other who care for me I have benefitted from the intellect and dedication of scientists doctors and educators Diabetes was once a death sentence thankfully that is no longer the case this time in history is the best time to be a diabetic CGMs pumps different types of insulin all make our lives easier and our control tighter and less stressful I try hard to be grateful for the good thing surrounding this genetic hand I ve been dealt for a long time I lived as if tomorrow was uncertain and in a large part I still feel that way but I approach the ramifications of that idea differently in my 20 s this idea of cheating death made me feel fragile so I engaged in risky behavior made bad decisions and turned my back not he hard work others had done for and with me to keep me alive I have regrets about those bad decisions because they have boomeranged back to me affecting my eyesight and feet I can t take those choices back and I won t live with regret about them I will confront the consequences and move forward I have never ask for sympathy and I don t find it productive I don t get angry when someone who doesn t know about my disease makes a comment about sugar tells me you can t eat that or doesn t know that their grandma s type II is far different than my type I In a moment like that I try to educate and grow awareness I don t understand why there is a comorbidity of diabetes and depression but I live it I feel it I battle it every day this is a heavy weight we all have to bear I carry guilt for fighting my mother when she tried to deliver an injection to me at 6 years old I feel angry at myself for keeping my wife up at night when I have an urgent low but I also feel a sense of pride that I wake up everyday that even though I have in the past chosen not to fight I wake up and face this disease head on I have grown I fight and I try and I do what I have to to stay alive it s not easy for me right now and I want to say to all of my fellow type I soldiers you can do this you can fight another day it s gonna hurt you are going to cry you are going to over bolus over eat forget to test ignore your beeping CGM but you re also gonna see a better A1C your gonna eat an awesome meal that doesn t send you running for the keto sticks I don t know what the hell I just wrote but as much as I am trying to convince you its gonna be ok I am trying twice as hard to convince myself I am currently searching for a reason to feel grateful to be upright today we are beating natural selection and thats weird because it makes me feel proud and it also makes me feel like I don t really belong on this side of the dirt

       "4008  Just found this first postSo I was diagnosed February 2018 and I just wanted a place to share how I got diagnosed So their were no signs at first we had no idea that I was diabetic so when I started getting symptoms we had all assumed that it was the flu I was throwing up everything that I ate and I felt sick all the time focusing was impossible I didn t even want to watch YouTube or read We were really confused because my temp wasn t high or anything but it was obvious that I was doing had so I stayed home and slept all day barely eating anything cause throwing up isn t fun and since we didn t know what was wrong they were giving me sprite smoothies and ice cream to help it didn t We went to Care now and they also thought it was the flu so we were just told to wait it out and given advice then I started always drinking water I had quite a bit before but now I was always thirsty and I always had to piss which sucked cause I didn t want to move I remember waking up in the middle of the night trying to drink from my 36oz cup of water and literally just crying if I didn t have any cause I felt like shit and didn t want to go down the stairs This continued for 1 2 weeks and I wasn t improving and my parents were worried cause I hadn t gotten sick in 6 7 years before this idk good genes But other than being thirsty and pissing a lot throwing up wasn t to crazy for the flu and not wanting to eat I starved myself those weeks and ate almost nothing I was getting THIN so they didn t take me to a hospital or anything And then I started hallucinating and my mom said NOPE I was so bad that I was legit seeing things and didn t even know we were at our house kept saying I wanted to go home scared the shit out of my grandmother who s a nurse and hears that from dying patients my mom literally drags me from my room cause I insist that I m fine and just want to lay down and drives me up to Care now where they I assume check my blood sugar around 500 600 cause I hadn t been eating and I was still pumping out a bit of insulin and next thing I know I m in an ambulance where I sleep cause I don t want to exist deal with anything headache hungry tired thirsty Then I m in the hospital and I don t remember why but I wasn t aloud to eat for 24 hours was at cook children s btw great people 10 10 never wanna go again didn t even give me water I hated it just ice chips I was hungry from starving myself pissed cause the other patients never shut up so I could sleep the bed was uncomfortable cause I didn t have my own room and I hadn t eaten for 1 2 weeks Things did get better though and after the 24 hours I got my first meal that I didn t throw up in 2 weeks scrambled eggs sausage ordered bacon But they didn t gimme t t milk and fruit loops I did hallucinate a bit more in the hospital some a bit more obvious than the others in order I SAW a spider hanging from the ceiling that scared the shit out of me when I thought that it disappeared cause it fell in my covers a light show like multiple cat lasers of different colors with the beam visible and water dripping from the ceiling like rain TDLR got diabetes thought it was the flu very wrong

       "4106  Diabetes depression and ADHDI ve had type 1 for 14 years this spring and can say confidently its had its fair share of ups and downs When I was first diagnosed at 9 years old I seemed to accept it with little to no trouble and adjusted to the lifestyle fairly quickly Sure it was tough especially as a kid but I always tried my best to remain positive and figured if i was to have a chronic disease I d prefer it to be something like type 1 diabetes and not something more fatal I ve also always struggled with depression and ADHD which as you can assume took quite the toll on my diabetes management and overall mental health Despite struggling with depression and ADHD I was always on top of my diabetes management trough grade school and high school which I largely attribute to my mom s help and guidance However once I went to college it all changed I moved across the country and was on my own for the first time in my life surrounded by completely new people in a state I had never even visited before and consequently my lifestyle completely changes as well With the pressure from school drinking and horrible eating habits my diabetes management quickly fell by the wayside I began checking less and less frequently and started taking my health less seriously as I went through college I was unmedicated for both my ADHD which only seemed to get worse with stress from both my health and school and my depression during college and besides from talk therapy I felt as though I had no outlet It became a constant and exhausting loop stress adhd gt not taking care of myself gt denial gt depression guilt My ADHD and depression quickly became insurmountable I went into a weird phase of denial where I just would push my health and diabetes into the corner of my mind I practically pretended like I didn t have a chronic illness at all and in a weird way it felt liberating For once in my life I didn t feel as ostracized didn t feel like a burden to my friends and wasn t constantly worried about my future health The denial was deep I would first go weeks without testing my blood sugar then months By the end of my senior year in college I was testing my blood sugar once a month on average if I was lucky I pushed it so far out of my mind that the idea of going back to managing my diabetes felt way too overwhelming The guilt and depression manifested as anger and I would take it out in several different ways blowing up at my friends over really trivial things self hatred and indulging in really risky behavior I gave myself a timeline and in it I only saw myself living to 38 45 because of my poor diabetes management and risky behavior with drugs and alcohol Drugs quickly became an escape mechanism and a dangerously effective one at that At this point I just didn t care Around this time I was hospitalized for DKA and put in the ICU for a week and a half I ve never felt worse in my life I truly thought it was the end and that I was dying I had no energy couldn t even stand without falling over threw up everything I put into my body and just generally felt like the life had been sucked out of me I was telling myself that I knew my body and could read the signals of low high blood sugar with little to no effort at all My hospitalization made me quickly realize that that wasn t so I wish I could say that it was a wake up call but it wasn t It only sent me into further denial and served as a sort of threshold which I d use to justify my reckless behavior I would tell myself being in the hospital wasn t that bad And it gave me the ability to falsely rationalize my inability to manage my health and life in general Now I m graduated college looking for a job and still struggling immensely with my diabetes management ADHD and depression Having diabetes is a curse in itself but coupled with mental illness and attention deficit disorders feels like a death sentence I feel helpless and like such a burden not only to my family and friends but to myself In the meantime I ve met with a psychiatrist to treat my ADHD with medication I plan on taking my depression more seriously as well and will be seeking therapy soon Has anyone else here dealt with depression and ADHD What is your advice on how to turn my life around

       "4169  Burnout in teenMy 15 year old has had T1 for seven years She s had a tough road for a lot of reasons that aren t even diabetes related but of course it s always been an added layer of wtf ness She uses a pump and a Dexcom G6 Our last order of sensors got back ordered so we re in the middle of a two week wait to get more No big deal We love the dexcom but it s not unusual for her to take a break from it sometimes Well we went out for lunch ch yesterday and she was annoyed because she forgot to charge her meter so she was waiting for it to come back to life with one of those portable chargers Again minor annoyance She didn t seem super stressed about it and we weren t either But just making conversation I did say something along the lines of are you missing the dexcom This is when she kind of unloaded saying she didn t care it sucked regardless she was really freakin sick of having diabetes no matter what and nothing makes it better etc etc In the moment just trying to diffuse the situation her dad and I did our best to empathize and support her and also reiterated that even though it s no ones fault that her pancreas crapped out it s all of our responsibility to manage it even when it sucks ass She did calm down relatively quickly and that was kind of that But I know her well enough to know that was the tip of the iceberg I know the obvious answer here is that diabetes burnout is a very real thing painfully common among T1 teens and she needs counseling And I totally agree She needs counseling for a lot of things and she has been in and out over the years But the poor kid just doesn t want to go She s so over it I know we re the parents here and we can force the issue but I am struggling with forcing her to do more diabetes related shit she just doesn t want to do I mean damn I m with her on this I m freaking sick of it too I hate this for her more than I have words for So I turn to you T1s of Reddit With the full understanding that counseling is probably where we ll end up on this are there things we can do at home or in conjunction with her school nurse etc to help combat this in other ways Do we enroll her in a sport or an acting class or something to distract her Do we go full force and talk about it a lot to get it out in the open Or do we just say screw it and keep beating the dead horse with therapy I am just clueless and my heart hurts for my poor kid Thanks in advance I appreciate this community a lot I ve lurked for years on another account and taken so many lessons from your experiences Your strength

       "4222  What s your scariest experience with type 1 I have a few that stick out All were related to low sugar Before I switched to a pump and CGM back when I was pretty disobedient and refused to test before making adjustments I woke up in the middle of the night and my hands were numb and tingly I immediately assumed it was high sugar and I grabbed a syringe and injected 4 units then right after I reached for my tester My sugar was 38 and I confused the effects of my low to just being tired also realized I was laying and my hands and they were just asleep Once on a mountain drive I started feeling low on the way home tested and was 58 I reached in my lunch pale and realized I packed diet instead of regular I was still about 20 min from the city I started panicking and digging around while speeding and trying to maintain control of the vehicle all while fighting the effects of a low I found a single packet of sugar for coffee under my seat I ate the entire thing and I made it to the store and grabbed soda still feeling like shit but eventually got better I believe that sugar packet was JUST enough to keep me steady till I got there Last incident was with the pump I have the Medtronic 670g I was fairly new to the pump at the time and I was in a hurry conversating and I needed to change out the reservoir but didn t have time to change the tubing I fucked up two things MAJOR I left the tubing connected to my body and when i removed the empty reservoir I forgot to rewind the plunger so it was still all the way up I filled the reservoir with 200 units of insulin and pushed it into the pump it was hard to push in and I didn t think twice it was because the plunger was up and as I was pushing in I was pushing all the insuling outta the reservoir through the tubing and into my stomach I only noticed because I got pain in my stomach So I said wait a minute NOOOO I pulled the reservoir out and sure enough found out I injected myself with almost 200 units of insulin I live right next to the hospital so I rushed there and they rushed me in the back they blew some vains while trying to inject the D50 in a hurry also struggled with my potassium levels crashing It was a scary experience and painful My sugar was about 32 for a couple hours disgusting experience Then I had to convince the Dr it wasn t attempted suicide because he has never seen someone take that much
