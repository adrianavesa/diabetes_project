What t1d financial advise would you give? ie) Day to day savings or for annual taxes.),"My son was just diagnosed with t1d and Its clear that supplies, and organization cost are going to be allot.

Symptoms before diagnosis?,"Hi everyone, 

I (22F) have just recently noticed some symptoms that have me somewhat concerned: 
a crazy dry mouth, excessive thirst and hunger, tiredness, muscle weakness, and urinating more frequently (having to get up in the middle of the night, for example). In addition, over the last month or so I’ve had 5 different people tell me that I’ve lost weight and I’m looking “too thin” (I can’t actually check how much weight I’ve lost since I don’t own a scale)

Diabetes doesn’t run in my family but autoimmune disorders do (mainly arthritis and psoriasis)

In a normal circumstance, I would just go to the doctor to get checked out. However, what is complicating this is a diagnosis of EBV (mononucleosis) about a month and a half ago. Symptoms of this include things like a loss of appetite (which I felt in December, total opposite now) and tiredness. So, I’m not sure if these symptoms could be related to that or if I should be concerned about T1D. 

I’m obviously not asking for a diagnosis, but I’m wondering how long between symptoms and diagnosis it was for you or your child. Basically, how bad/dangerous would it be if I waited a bit to see if these symptoms go away (and therefore would suggest that it was just the mono). I don’t want to take an unnecessary trip to the ER if I don’t need to, but I know untreated T1D can be life threatening.

Spiking overnight - not sure why,"29F, pump user, Fiasp

Over the past couple of weeks I've woken up high or tested high in the middle of the night maybe 30% of the time. I'm on a Libre break this week due to supply issues but before that it seemed the spikes were around midnight to 2am. If I've gone to bed a little bit high (say BG of 9-12 after dinner) I've been correcting by putting a +10-20% basal on for an hour, which is usually sufficient.

Last night/today's example:

Pre dinner BG of 4.4 so suspended basal for 30min
Post dinner BG of 12.6 at 11pm so did +20% basal for one hour
Midnight BG 9.4 so temp basal of +10% for one hour
Fasting BG at 7.20am 15.9

Error messages and visual fill window not turning red?,"Hi, 

Hope it's OK to post here because I'm not a diagnosed diabetic but need to start checking my sugars for other reasons. 

I'm using the CVS Health Advanced Glucose Meter and have not successfully managed to get a reading despite like six pricks. 

The instructions say when it gets enough blood, the 'visual fill window' on the test strip will turn red / fill out. They also say, when you get enough blood the meter will beep once and you need to remove from your finger prick at that time. 

My problem is that I get the beep very quickly, and if I *don't* remove from the site at the beep, I just get an Error 4 message. 

But my fill window is still not red (not even partly) by the time it beeps. So basically, it beeps for removal before the visual fill window is filled.

Then if I *do* remove at the beep despite the visual fill window still being empty, I get another Error message (1 or 4, don't quite recall -- but no reading). 

I don't understand -- what are you supposed to do if the meter beeps at you before the fill window indicates it has enough blood? 

Does anyone else have this issue and what do you do? Does it sound like maybe I'm not getting enough blood sample to begin with (my lancet is on the highest setting 8 and I still only get a tiny drop)?

Since then, it's been a nightmare trying to get Georgia's district manager to contact my district manager about job openings in my area. I am all moved into my new house frantically filling out job applications for work elsewhere because I was hoping to be employed by the 5th and that's in 3 days. 
And what I am resentful about is that I was just diagnosed with T1 in January and now I cannot just work anywhere. Instead of applying to work at jobs i'd enjoy, I'm applying for whatever has health benefits because I have to buy insulin, metformin, needles, lancets, test strips. This is a fucking nightmare. I thought I had this all planned out. Even my fiancé moved to Georgia and crashed on friends' couch for three weeks to find work before we moved into our house. So now he's employed and I have no idea if I even have a job anymore. I just keep hearing ""Georgia's DM hasn't emailed me back yet, but i'll let you know when she does."" 
I never thought I'd be the burden. I thought I had this all under control. I am so fucking angry. Fuck suddenly needing health insurance and fuck diabetes.",diabetes_t1,1580691283,brokenbbygate,6,1,True,2020-02-02

I can’t manage pain after surgery and it’s making my blood sugars skyrocket. Please help,"Hi everyone I had a surgical resection of endometriosis, appendectomy, nerve block, and botox injections into my pelvic floor on Tuesday it’s now Sunday and my pain is still at an excruciating level and it’s causing my blood sugar to run extremely high. I managed to get it back it back to somewhat normal (150s) and went to the ER today for my pain and they gave me pain meds while I was there and I had no issues keeping my blood sugars level (even tho I’ve needed 2x my normal basal rate to stay in the 250s while in pain). I tried to explain to the doctors being in pain makes my blood sugars run really high but they didn’t seem to take me seriously since I was in the low 100s while on pain meds.

Post-meal spikes getting increasingly extreme for no apparent reason,"Six months ago, my ratio was 1u per 12g and I was taking 4.5 units Tresiba daily. The basal has not needed adjustment as regular basal testing has shown me. Around October, I started getting problems with spiking after my first meal in a day. Skipping breakfast only postponed it to the next meal. Eating a zero-carb breakfast would sometimes postpone it to the next meal, and other times, puzzlingly, I would get a spike then. I have the same activity levels and weight as back then. I made increasingly aggressive changes to my dietary habits and started prebolusing and was increasingly stringent about it, trying to fix the problem. Instead, the problem has been getting steadily worse and I today spiked from 6 to 13.5 after a breakfast with 37g net carbs with low glycemic index.

Recruiting for Community Self-Experiment: How do Hot Showers Affect Blood Glucose?,"cross-posted to [r/diabetes](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/), [r/diabetes\_t1](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/), [r/diabetes\_t2](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/), [r/QuantifiedSelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/), and the [Quantified Self Forum](https://forum.quantifiedself.com/) to recruit as many participants as possible.

A few days ago, [u/NeutyBooty](https://www.reddit.com/u/NeutyBooty/) posted on how [hot showers caused their blood glucose to rise](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ev6zsb/does_anyone_elses_readings_go_up_after_a_hot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Lot's of commenters confirmed the general observation, but for some it appeared to be a CGM artifact, for some it matched their finger-stick meter, and others they see a BG drop.

[I've been interested in self-tracking and experimentation for a while](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/) and this seems like a perfect opportunity for a communal self-experiment.

**We currently have 7 Redditors participating** [from the original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ev6zsb/does_anyone_elses_readings_go_up_after_a_hot/)**, but I'm hoping we can get even more people signed up so we can get a really great data set. Anyone's who's interested in participating, please comment or PM me.**

The basic idea is to agree on a simple experimental protocol, each of us run the experiment, combine and analyze the data, and see if we can figure out 1) Is the shower effect real or a CGM artifact and 2) how does it vary from person-to-person?

The 7 of us organized and worked out the protocol using group chat and and a new subreddit, [r/QuantifiedDiabetes](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedDiabetes/). **We're starting the experiments and looking for more participants.**

Here's the details:

* Background:
   * In [u/NeutyBooty](https://www.reddit.com/u/NeutyBooty/)'s post on [hot showers causing blood glucose to rise](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ev6zsb/does_anyone_elses_readings_go_up_after_a_hot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), lot's of commenters confirmed the general observation, but for some it appeared to be a CGM artifact, for some it matches BGM, and for others they see a BG drop.
   * From my PMs, some of us have CGM's, some have regular BGM's, and some have both.
* Questions to answer:
   * Is the ""hot shower effect"" a real change in blood glucose or an artifact of CGM sensors getting warm (or some other environmental change)?
   * What is the person-to-person variation in the magnitude and direction of the ""hot shower effect?""
* Protocol:
   * Pick a time when your blood glucose is relatively stable (no recent meals, medication, exercise, etc.)
   * Turn on the shower to the hottest temperature you're comfortable with and let the temperature stabilize. If possible, measure the temperature (e.g. with an instant read thermometer).
   * Measure your blood glucose with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.
      * If you don't have both types of meters, use whichever you do have (data will still be useful for the second goal)
   * Take a 20 minute shower.
   * As soon as you finish the shower, measure your blood glucose again with both a CGM and regular finger-stick meter and record the data.
   * Monitor your blood sugar for one hour (measure every 15 min. for finger-stick meter)
   * Record anything that might have affected blood glucose during the experiment.
   * Repeat the experiment multiple times (preferably ≥3, but any data is better than nothing) to assess within-person variability.
   * Post your data in a comment or PM to [u/sskaye](https://www.reddit.com/u/sskaye/). I'll compile it and make available to everyone to analyze
      * If you want your data to be anonymous, just let me know and I'll remove all identifying info.
   * Optional variations:
      * Vary the time or temperature of the shower
      * Try a bath, hot tub, or sauna instead of a shower.
* Data to collect:
   * For each glucose measurement: time, blood glucose, any important observations
   * General: whatever demographic info you're comfortable sharing (e.g. male/female, T1/T2/LADA, age)",diabetes_t1,1580568382,sskaye,1,1,True,2020-02-01

Does anxiety cause your blood sugar to sky rocket?,"Hey,

Im in the process of getting a new job in a kitchen (my first time working in a professional kitchen) - ive done some trial shifts and in those ive been trying to figure out how to keep my blood sugar under control with the new routine (quite hard as theres no set time for meals - staff will take their meal from the staff meal pot when they have 2 or 3 minutes to spare, and it is eaten within those 2 or 3 minutes. I see the staff all huddled around a big plate and then go back to work within 2 minutes.

Today I was hungry but I didnt eat as my sugar level sky rocketed. I deal with a lot of anxiety and its been very prominent now with starting this new line of work. Today I woke up and my BG was 7.7mmol. I took 6 units knowing my anxiety will make it sky rocket. When i checked it again after 30 mins it was at 9.2mmol so I took 2 more units and went to work. 

I didnt eat anything all day, towards the end of my shift I checked my BG (thank God for the freestyle libre, I wouldnt be able to check my blood sugars in a kitchen without it!!) and it had raised to 17.0mmol and was still rising! I took 10 units to bring it down, which it did, into a hypo 1 hour after my shift ended but I corrected it with lucozade. 

So yeah, does this happen to you guys? Is it normal for anxiety to raise blood sugars so much? I understand its to do with the fight or flight response from anxiety, where the liver pumps out glucose as a way for the body to have more energy when trying to fight or escape in a life threatening situation, but just wondering if its normal for blood glucose to raise so high.",diabetes_t1,1580580562,PixelatedFoodie,3,1,True,2020-02-01

I know she isn’t just careless.  She struggles with depression and has a hard time staying motivated to stay on top of it.

She thinks this is normal and I’m really just terrified and always stressed out because I love her and don’t want her to die early.  The other day I was sitting in my car just crying because I feel like she’s slowly killing herself. I really need some kind of help.

There are days she keeps her levels roughly under control, but there are also days like this one:

Life hacks and tips for lowering a1c and losing weight?,"Got news from my doc that my a1c is 10.7. I’m pretty bummed because that’s the highest it’s been pretty much since diagnosis.

I lift weights but haven’t been as active the last 6 weeks due to getting surgery in early December. I plan to get back to the gym tomorrow and work with a trainer to lose weight, and luckily my doc increased my insulin dose.

LibreLink App for Libre 2: Alarms not working with Sony Xperia XZ3,"At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway - not for everyone, but for hand-picked DM I patients like me. I had the Libre 1 before (I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself), and it was good.

However, the Libre 2 is a relevation. I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms - when they work.

The problem: When you put on the sensor, you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App. After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor, which is exactly 2 weeks. (You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app, but the alarms will go to the reader. I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms. If you activate with the App, the reader won't work.) 

I do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times, so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3. Also, I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch, a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE. This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife.

When it works - which it did at times -, the system is absolutely brilliant. It kind of gave me a new lease of life. I exercise very much, and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia.

BUT: **The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best.** After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious ""No alarms"" warning in the app.

Despite this, **the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings ""No connection with the sensor"" regularly, also at night.** All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep!

Last night I was woken by several of these false alarms. This morning I got stupid ""no connection alarms"" all through the morning. The program asks you to check you sensor, but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11:30 a.m. that at my glucose was 14 mmol/l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin. So **when the system state is ""No connection"", the system will not warn about hyper- and hypoglucemia.**

Abbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless. The whole system is a black box. Part of it works through Near field communication (NFC), part through Bluetooth (you get a warning when you turn off Bluetooth on your phone), but the sensor does not appear under Bluetooth devices in the phone's Bluetooth configuration pages.

I have 2 **questions** to the community:

**(1) Do other users of Libre2 experience the same issue?**

**(2) Which smartphone do you use?** I could imagine that the problems are specific to a smartphone model or brand. - Would it make sense to upgrade to a Sony Xperia Z5 to get rid of the issue? Can anyone with Sony Xperia Z5 confirm that the LibreLink App gives out correct alarms?

Skin swollen and hard after removing omnipod,"
Hi everyone, I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this before/knows what is up. Ever since I woke up earlier today, my arm has been hurting where my omnipod had been set, and I’ve not been able to rest my arm on anything due to the pain. I changed the pod and put a new one on my other arm, since I had to change either way today. The area where my old pod was placed is now quite red and swollen, it even feels hard in some places when poking it. 

Another thing to add is that the lowest my BG has been since I woke up is 9,7 mmol/L (174.6 mg/dL), and this was a few hours after having changed pods. Does anyone know why the area is hard and swollen now, or otherwise have experienced this too? I read in some different places that people with similar experiences had gotten an infection, but I also read that others had accumulated insulin underneath the affected area. My body has seemed to be quite resistant to insulin today, so I’m wondering if it might just be some insulin that has gotten stuck under my skin.

Lantus Clikstar,"Hi everybody, 

not sure whether this is the right place to post but just wondering if anyone could give me some advice. 

I live in Australia, and today I went to see my endo to get a new script for my Lantus. Instead of the normal prefilled Lantus Solostar pens, I received the individual cartridges, which require a reloadable pen to actually be useful to me. I went online to see where i could get one of these pens and managed to find out that what I'm looking for is the Sanofi Clikstar refillable pen (i think), but no sites would allow me to actually purchase one of these from Australia.

 I called the helpline who just told me to ask my educator or call an alternate number which didn't even ring (just call failed twice). 

Anyway, I'm just wondering if there are any Aussies (or not) who may know how i can access one of these pens, or another that fits the Lantus cartridges, as I feel like the insulin is just taunting me, locked inside those little glass vials.

Control IQ Pitfalls and Possible Workarounds,"Howdy fellow T1s!

First off, I am super glad that Control IQ is in my life now.  I have been waiting for this for so long it's not even funny.

But let's talk about one thing that has hit me twice already in the week that I've been on Control IQ.

Sensor errors.

So I started my time with Control IQ during an active sensor session.  Was it slightly confusing after the hour+ long training that I didn't actually have to pair my pump to a device?  Yes.

Workaround: I just made sure my session was active on my phone and started a new session on the pump.  Pump talked to the phone and within a couple minutes everything was up and running and operating as expected.  Probably won't have to deal with the likes of this again.  But maybe every time a new transmitter is paired.  We'll see..

So that sensor error...

I awoke yesterday and for some reason the sensor started failing.  This was not, repeat, not, a compression low.  I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour (after waking up).  I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 (twice). 

What I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do.

I calibrated.

It buzzed and told me to test again. I did so and recalibrated.

Within a couple minutes, the rise to 160 began on the pump.  But it didn't do it all at once.  It did it gradually over 20 minutes.   Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar.  It kicked in 2.5 units...  Um...

So I suspended basal and waited an hour.  I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings.  Still had a ton on board though.  It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while.  

This was not a relaxing experience.

Fast forward to today.  I changed the sensor last night (it was getting flakey in the evening).  This morning there was an actual compression low.  Even though I was in suspend mode, I was actually 170.  I waited for it to raise back up, after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio.  Figured that would knock me down to the 120-130 range.  But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units.

Needless to say, I did not work out and I ended up going low.

SO...  IN THE FUTURE...  

Any time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low, I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour.  By then, whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won't have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change.

It should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience.  This may be a rare occurrence.  But if it happens to you, maybe what I'm trying will work for you.

I'll report here if it happens again.  Also, I'll report it to customer service as well.

What a nightmare,"This is just insane and no one I tell the story to has any idea what I'm talking about and I just need to rant about this. Starting Jan 1 I tried to reorder my CGM supplies through the pharmacy I have always gone through. They said they couldn't do it anymore because I needed to go through a DME. So that's the first 2 hours on the phone, trying to find a DME that did business with my insurance. Now I had to loop in my endo and get them to send the scripts. They said they did two different times over the course of 2 weeks (I know this stuff takes time and I was trying to be patient). They straight lied. I sent the office an email letting them know they were going to get me killed and asking why it is ok for them to lie to me regarding my health. Called on Monday, pissed. Actually got them to send it. Byram calls me Tuesday and says they finally got the scripts and now they are sending off to my insurance for what I assumed was a preauth. I called my insurance today to ask if they had received what they needed and they told me they didn't get anything. So I asked my insurance what they even needed from Byram and I got an education on the difference between supplies and equipment and the fact that my insurance shouldn't need any type of authorization. Back to Byram, I ask what they needed from my insurance and I actually heard the rep say ""cgm does not require preauth"" and she asked to put me on hold. Ten minutes later I get told that because I was type 1 they could send the order right out. I guess people missed that during the first 2 weeks? Why does the patient have to do all the work and learn a new language?

What's your endocrinologist/CDE horror story?,"I'll start. Mine was a few years ago. First visit with a new endo, having just celebrated 23 years of type 1 with decently good control (zero visits from paramedics or episodes of DKA). My a1c at this particular visit was 6.1, with very low hypo risk according to my Dexcom data.

This doctor (50ish years old) walked into the room about 30 minutes late, introduced herself, and started drawing pictures about diabetes. Basic, ""insulin is the key to get sugar into the house that represents your muscles"" type of stuff that you learn when you're first diagnosed. ""Oh! And here's a boat to represent carbs.""

After about 20 minutes of this I politely tried to tell her that I've been at this for a couple decades and also got my degree in biology and she cut me off, saying ""I just like to go over the basics every time I see a new patient."" Then she paused and added a few extra ""scientific terms"" to the drawings for me. I started to understand why I had been waiting for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

[Insulin is the key!](https://preview.redd.it/ouimikj1mzd41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ac3fbedef0153ece782294e1cee7ebdeabf49c)

She never bothered to ask any questions about my lifestyle, activity levels, or history with diabetes. Eventually she did flip through a few days of printouts from my Dexcom, zeroing in on a set failure and a couple days of stubborn highs.

""Oh my god! What happened here?!""

She went on to pick apart every individual high, telling me my ratios were ""way off"" and then asked me accusingly how many carbs I was eating per day. I estimated about 100 (quite frankly a very low estimate because I was pretty active that summer and doing a lot of manual labor). She literally gasped and clutched her chest. ""You eat 100 grams of CARBS per day?!"" I am fairly certain I saw her write NON-COMPLIANT on my chart.

I cried in the parking lot after that appointment, then I got mad, and finally burned out. I avoided making an appointment with a new endocrinologist for almost 2 years, until my pump was failing and I had to schedule one. Fortunately when I finally called and asked to be placed with someone else, I got the completely opposite kind of endocrinologist. He's there to help when I need it, and is actually interested in learning what works for patients. I'm so grateful to not feel crushing guilt and anxiety every time I'm due for an appointment.

We went to fill her prescription for the first time this year and were told that it would now be around $400 for the same amount.

I can barely even afford to make it day to day, I am on my last three cartridges and have no way to get anymore. I don’t wanna ask my friend to send anymore because I know she needs them. But when I had insurance, my blood sugar was so much better thanks to dexcom and not fearing running out of insulin or supplies, and now I can barely afford my insulin every month and I always feel like I’m drowning. I feel like such a financial burden to anyone who loves me and to myself. How do I handle feeling this way?

Some advice for those who are parents of a type 1 diabetic..and a little rant,"Let your child get involved in the insurance process, doctor visits and ordering supplies ASAP. I am 25 years old and about to fall off my mothers insurance. Up until about 1yr ago she handled the insurance and supply orders, anything that wasn’t right or if billing was right she would handle. Since she is on my hippa she’s also handle any technical support stuff as well when I lived with her from 13-22yr old. Of course she could just be an outlier and most parents don’t do this stuff, but it led to me being behind the 8 ball when it comes to handling this stuff myself. I have been so stressed this last week because my supply company was trying to charge me for everything i normally get for free. I got so much conflicting info ranging from not having medical records, needing pre authorization to simply “your insurance isn’t verified for this year and we didn’t know your deductible got waived with an A1C on file”. Took a 45 min conferenced call between my supplier, me and insurance company on the 5th try to finally (hopefully) resolve this issue. Now I am playing phone tag with tandem software support because my upgrade is not showing any training in my portal for the new control iq. Don’t let your kids be like me!

Control IQ vs Mexican restaurant dinner,"Traveling for work.

Late dinner after 7pm:

* 2 giant margaritas
* chips, guac, salsa
* a giant burrito that spanned the length of my plate...probably 8""-9"" filed with carne asada &amp; shrimp.  I ate maybe 2/3's of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I had NO IDEA how many carbs &amp; protein any of this could be.  I bolused 4.85 units for 40 carbs after we ordered drinks.  After deciding on food I entered a 2-hour extended bolus for 6.7 units.

I went to bed with my G6 reading 151 mg/dL and my pump had \~6 units IOB between my last bolus and increased basal deliveries.  Getting ready for sleep I knew more than likely that dinner would start to kick in during the next 2-4 hours, since I was alone in a hotel room and I had so much insulin on board, I was going to rely on Control IQ to do the work.   Sleep Activity profile was turned on.

I was out cold last night and didn't hear any pump or phone alarms for my G6.  My G6 see's a peak at 1am with readings of 255mg/dL. Before control IQ (let us call them the dark ages) I would have been &gt;300 by morning; I would have had a giant headache and generally not felt very good.  

At 5 am local time I wake up with a CGM reading of 150mg/dL and 2 units IOB.  30 minutes later my glucose is 123mg/dL.  It did this all with basal adjustments, no boluses.  Most of these basals were 2x my normal overnight rates.  One of the most impressive adjustments occurred after 5am when Control IQ LOWERED my basal rate to less than 50% of normal to make sure it stuck the landing.

I'm very impressed.",diabetes_t1,1580218821,buddy0329,13,1,True,2020-01-28

Scared and Confused,"Hello to everyone who reads this, I’ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors. I’m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on. I’ve been excessively thirsty, urinating way more than usual, including during the night which I’ve NEVER done before, extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class, and above all I’ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat. All I was told was my glucose was high, and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment, and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension. She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn’t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today. Well, yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day, and then I ate lunch with a friend. Shortly after getting lunch (we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating) I had a migraine and stomach pain again, and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could. At about 7:30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn’t feel nearly that bad. I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9:00 when I couldn’t stand it anymore, mind you, I’ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER, so it’s obviously bad. I tell the nurse everything that’s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done, I just kinda got sent away. The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton. The CT scan comes back normal, which isn’t surprising, and I’m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches, and then the nurse came in and discharged me. At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them, not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER. I feel incredibly stupid. I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on, and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork.

If we give him insulin to compensate his high BG **through the pump**, it shows almost no reaction, and it's continuing slowly going up more and more. So we need to use a pen.

Before you hit 'calibrate' on screen, do the math to make sure it'll be in that range or it'll throw a second error and tell you to change sensor. Rinse, repeat. FWIW ISIG also has to be between 6-200 during calibration or it won't accept.

Active lifestyle and Omnipod vs. Tandem pumps,"Hey all!

I was diagnosed a little over a year ago at 27 y/o with T1D. It was a very steep learning curve and I had to adapt quickly. I exercise vigorously 5-6 days a week, play a competitive sport on weekends, and go to the beach/hike/ and swim every other weekend. I’ve been curious about tandem pumps for awhile with the mindset of “if I turn my omnipod off during exercise, why don’t I get a tandem pump and save myself some trouble?” And I’m wondering now if the omnipod is the best way to manage. 

I’m on the Omnipod DASH, and Dexcom G6 but I’m considering going a different route in terms of pumps. I love the Dexcom, I’d change a few things though. 

To the tandem pump wearers, do you wish you had an omnipod? Why/why not? 

What’s it like sleeping with one? 

Day to day wear? 

To my understanding when you want to start an activity you just take it off. The omnipod you have turn off but it stays on you, which is sometimes annoying but I’ve been able to manage. I also like to go swimming/ snorkeling (we live on an island) but I’m worried that each time I go in the water for more than 5minutes the pump will malfunction. That has happened so many times! 

I’m not trying to knock the omnipod as a product it’s great. It’s low profile and easy to manage. But if there’s something better out there for my lifestyle then I owe it to myself to look.

Getting a pump! Should I get one now or wait?,"Hi everybody! 

I've been t1 since I was 8. I had an OmniPod for a short time when I was a teenager and really liked that it was tubeless. 

I'm getting a Dexcom G6 and had been planning on going with OmniPod again, but then I saw the info about Tandem's Control iQ and how it links up to the G6.

However, OmniPod is supposed to come out with similar technology later this year, also linked to the G6.

I've always been really hesitant about having a CGM or pump, I don't like having things attached to me and the tubing of a pump kind of freaks me out.

I'm considering whether I should wait until Insulet comes out with the OmniPod closed loop system or if I should just go with the Tandem.

Dealing with burnout,"Hi everyone,

Been T1 for almost 15 years now. When I was younger I had no issues testing, injecting, etc. for the past 5 years or so I have only been testing once or twice a day as opposed to the 5 I was before. I have stopped injecting my own insulin pump sites and have others do it for me as the anxiety it gives me is too much to handle. I haven’t had any serious drawbacks from living like this. A1C is higher than I would like but not terrible (typically between 8.0-9.0). However lowering this is always a “goal”. 

My question is how to get back to caring about all of this and start injecting on my own. I know the easy answer is just do it, and trust me I’ve tried, but I always find myself back to not caring. I will be having to move out of my parents here in a few months once I graduate and being better about my diabetes is a goal of mine so my parents don’t worry about me.

Help! I don't know how to level out my blood sugar!,"So I'm a female in my 30's, and have just been told by a doctor that I ""may"" be prediabetic.

The first thing I've noticed is that if I watch my carb intake, and don't just load up on pasta, bread, or loads of sugar, my blood sugar rarely tops 95. My first question is this; when I had my bloodwork done that day, we had just  eaten at Golden Corral that morning.  Could that have been the reason for my high levels that day?  Could I not actually be prediabetic?  I know that no one can give a hard answer to this, but I'm just wondering bc my numbers have not been that bad.

"Control IQ, Showers, and Suspend Mode","Morning everyone!

Upgraded to Control IQ yesterday and it has been pretty awesome thus far.  Been a T1 for over 29 years now and on pump therapy for probably 16 years.  I'll admit to it being a little weird to completely surrender correction doses to a machine, but I'm doing my best!

I don't know how showers affect all of you, but I will get false BG increases that correspond with my time in the shower with my CGM.  I've worn G4, G6, Medtronic.  All of them do this with me and it goes right back down to where it should within 20 minutes after the shower.

And maybe I've been lazy, but I've never bothered to put any of my pumps in Suspend mode during my showers.  Even with Basal IQ, if I'm trending down and insulin was stopped, so what, I'm not taking the pump in the shower anyway.  Nor am I ever going to bolus right before a shower, nor right after.

But it occurred to me this morning that it might be a good idea to start using Suspend mode now, especially now that I have Control IQ and if my BG happens to be in the more elevated, treatable range.  

So is that what is recommended now?  Make sure I go into suspend mode?  Then do I go back out once the shower effect goes away 20 minutes post shower?

Dexcom and insurance,"

Hey, first time posting and wondering if anyone would advice, tips, anything.

I am on the dexcom. My insurance covered it as a prescription and whenever I had to pick my sensors it cost me around $50. Well, at the very last week of 2019, my company randomly decided to drop our insurance and than reinstate it again (it was a big hassle and shit show) and now dexcom is considered a medical expense. I now have to pay $200 every time I pick them up. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to lower this cost? Is this something I can discuss with my endro? With all other expenses I can't afford the $200 so I might have to drop dexcom despite it saving my life many times. Today the pharmacy charged me $500 for the sensors. I had money in my flex spending thankfully but I was going to use that money for a pump. It's frustrating how difficult insurance makes everything.",diabetes_t1,1579891754,kahlgin,4,1,True,2020-01-24

Looking for some ideas for my free t1d app - student project.,"Hey all,

My apologies if this isn't allowed here, I've been lurking here for a while whilst learning about t1d as my girlfriend's little sister has been diagnosed recently. 


I've decided to develop an app for type-1 diabetics, it's pretty simple - you can just pop in your insulin to carb ratio and choose food from popular restaurant menus on the app and it'll workout the required units of insulin. As somebody with plenty of allergies, I know the stress of having to ask staff or frantically Google nutritional info online - so I hope this can make a little difference to a few people at least.



This will be part of my final project at university (Leeds, UK), and I'd love if you could follow my Instagram (@weareava_diabetes) and drop me a follow. I'll be launching some user testing over the next couple months and it'd mean a lot to me if some people from this community could take part!

Type 1 is an evolutionary advantage in the winter?,"Hey y’all. My friend’s partner’s sister was telling me about a paper he wrote on the evolutionary advantage of Type 1 diabetes being a means for surviving the harsh winter cold in ancient Nordic tribes. The reasoning she gave was that a man/woman from these Nordic tribes who had a higher blood sugar would usually run a lot warmer than with a nominal glucose level protecting them better from the harsh cold. 

Starches would be a type of food less common in a cold Northern climate such as an ancient Nordic tribal region thus they would have a very low carb diet supplemented with fibers and proteins. With modern diets having such a ubiquitous amount of starches and refined carbohydrates, such a Type 1 diabetic scenario is rare to impossible to find naturally occurring today. 

Now my opinion....ummm, No. This would not be a feasible advantage given the all the bad things Type 1 also would come with. Also, that’s great you have a higher glucose so you’re warmer in the winter. Now how exactly are you going to get it down?

I just wanted to know what do you guys think?

Breakfast spikes + honeymoon period + reactive hypoglycemia = very frequent roller coasters. Help,"I made a recent thread about how I spike after the first meal I eat in a day. If I skip breakfast entirely, it occurs during lunch. Likewise if I just eat no carbs for breakfast. However, since I'm also honeymooning and have reactive hypoglycemia, I then get a rapid drop, and then I get a rebound high, and then another reactive hypo, etc. Even taking no additional insulin, I will go on a rollercoaster resembling a sawtooth wave (rebound highs happen much slower than the reactive hypos do for me)

Even if I eat only 30g breakfast with low glycemic index, it still happens. The increase in BG is also sometimes more than can be accounted for by the dietary carbs alone, which would suggest dawn phenomenon, but if I simply don't eat anything, I stay perfectly level, so I have no idea what is going on on that front. Could just be Libre overestimating the fluctuations, but that also seems kinda unlikely since it would either have to be way off, or the insulin would have to have essentially no effect for the first two hours.

If my mother didn't help me I would be dead right now. Thinking back on it we should have just called 911 for an ambulance. I used the last percent of energy to get into the car and she drove me to the ER. They rushed me in and my blood sugar level was over 1000. They could not get blood out of me, it was coagulating. But they finally did. I spent 6 days in ICU, the intensive care unit. My potassium levels were super low, got IV's over and over. Finally made it out and they discharged me. I feel so much better and I am so grateful to be alive and survive. The doctors said they have never seen such a high level over 1000 BS. I am on a low carb Keto diet now. I take 35 units of Levemir in the morning and take Novolog with each meal 3 times a day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My blood sugar level has been in the 100's like 188 to 130 for this past week but every time around 3pm to 5pm my Blood sugar starts to drop to like 90, then 80, then 70, when this happens I drink some orange juice or glucose liquid or gel, then it spikes back up to 130 and stays like that till the morning. I have no idea why my BS keeps dropping like this every day. It's a pattern. I have been calling my doctor about and she now has me Minus 5 units for lunch and now dinner. I know that I just got diagnosed and its a feel out process my doctor doesn't know the right insulin intake yet because it's only been 2 weeks. But this scares me so much and I am afraid to go to sleep every night and is overall very stressful for me. I am doing great with my new diet. I just dip in the middle of the day. I take an AC1 test in a few weeks. I am just so new to this and wonder if anybody can help me or know why this is happening to me. 
This is what I have been eating every day- its the same thing everyday lol

I just wanted to put what I have been eating everyday, I am new to this and I feel like I have adjusted well since this turned my whole world upside down and I feel very scared, basically not knowing next to any information when I left the hospital. If anybody out there reads this thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can help me with any information, tips or insight about why the level keeps dropping this reply to this. I am fighting and I will never give up, I am beating this, I just want to be stable blood sugar level and be able to do stuff. Sorry for the insanely long post. I do not know what to do and I am scared. I love you all and God bless, I am on the edge hoping I get a response because this is so new to me.

Trying to determine drunk boyfriends state - guidance/advice please,"it’s a long one!

My boyfriend (27) has T1 and he ran out of long acting a couple days ago. He’s just been using his fast acting/short term as usual. (Against my constant nagging) he does not currently have a meter/ any way for me to test his sugar levels.

Today we have been hanging with friends 
all day and he’s been drinking since about 2 in the afternoon (it’s 130am now). Light beer and seltzer (not sure if it matters) in the day and he started drinking liquor around 8pm-1030 or so.

Usually he’s on top of his shit, but he’s pretty drunk. I made him a sandwich and he took some insulin before bed, he told me it was enough BUT to bring his glucose tablets up to bed with us “just in case”.

He woke up a little bit ago and was super sweaty and i tried talking to him and it was like he was having a conversation with someone else- he would respond when i spoke but not to what i was saying 
( example:
   me- are you okay? what do you need?
   him- no i’ll be there don’t worry
   me*shaking him awake*- get up what’s wrong what do you need 
    him- what’re you talking about? are you done? can we get out of the kitchen)

Then, he said he was fine, was annoyed with me for waking him and making him sit up, and he rolled over and went back to sleep.  He’s done this twice now.

*small update* now he keeps saying random things like “thank you very much for doing that” unprovoked

We haven’t been together super long, i’ve never seen him this drunk and i’m not sure if im just overreacting but i can’t get a straight answer out of him and with no way to test his levels idk what to do.

He’s hot, being very rude, and not making any sense. i’ve never been in this situation. Obviously i don’t want to call an ambulance or anything -not sure who else to talk to about this. 


TL;DR: my boyfriend is drunk, with no way for me to test his blood sugar and he’s acting strange.",diabetes_t1,1579415054,hellzbailz,14,1,True,2020-01-19

\- Whenever I do high cardio based workouts that dont really involve any weightlifting, my numbers skyrocket up to the high 200s (assuming I started around 100). An example of type of workout that would do is:

10 rounds  
1-5: 15 cal assault bike, 15 GHDs  
5-10: 15 cal assault bike, 15 burpees

\- Whenever we lift heavy, it tends to stay the same range if not drop a little bit

\- The short workouts where you enter the hurt locker and dont come out for a few minutes post workout is when all hell breaks loose with my numbers. I'll drop down to like 30 with the blink of an eye. This is the stuff like Fran or 30 second max calories on the assault bike.

For the past six or seven years, I've just not been sick. Like I've felt sick, but never feeling like I will throw up.

This all changed a couple weeks ago when I threw up in the first time in years.

Now, I'm not healthy, not even gonna lie, but I always thought something was off as I was getting so lucky.

I'm not that good at science, but I'm pretty sure autoimmune means the stuff that fights disease right? So, I may be wrong, but would there be a link between my immune system being weaker than most as I've not been sick, and the diagnosis just days after being sick?

I had a mental breakdown over $30 syringes.,"So, I was misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes two years ago. I had to find out the hard way two years later that I actually had type 1.5. My previous doctors from two years ago failed to check to see if my pancreatic antibodies were positive or negative. Lucky me, it happened to be positive this whole time. I had to suffer the consequences of my misdiagnosis and was hospitalized for four days with Diabetic Ketoacidosis(DKA). 
After my hospitalization, I got a prescription of lantus, humalog, syringes, and lancets. Oh boy, it was expensive. It was around $90+. I had to take a leave of absence for two weeks at my job, which really took a toll on my financials.  I wasn’t able to pick up my last check I earned because I was in the hospital and my job sent out my check over a month ago. I haven’t gotten anything in the mail, so I’m assuming it got lost. At this point, I only have $170 in my bank account saved up. 
Moving on to today, I ran out of my syringes and had to go pick some more up from CVS. On my drive back home, I couldn’t handle myself and my emotions just came pouring out. Right now, I only have $146 dollars to my name and I don’t really have a whole lot to survive on. My parents won’t bother helping me out because they think I waste my money on going out to eat too much. I’m just so angry at life right now.

Need some guidance: best gear to easily deal with diabetes?,"Hi! I guess I should start that I'm Type 1 for almost 3 years now and I still feel kind of newby as a diabetic. As I was diagnosed 24 years old, started using insulin injections as doctors recommended (insulin is free in my country) and kept doing that until now. 

I'm doing my tests every 6 months and my  long-term blood sugar is steady on 6,5-7mm/l for last couple of years. But I'm working pretty hard and I actually realised that my blood sugar levels (which seem to vary from time to time) are impacting my moods and work productivity quite a lot, so now, as I started to earn a little bit more money, I'm starting to think that maybe I should invest in some kind of tech gear, which would help me keep my sugar levels steady and improve the quality of life.

So, basically, I'm looking for the best way to take care of my type 1. I've heard that there is such a thing as insulin pump, glucose meters which are checking the levels each 5mins and other stuff. So I was wondering what would be the best way. I'm kind of a geek with computers, cameras and gadgets, but I know nothing in terms of diabetes tech.

What is the best way to support my boyfriend who was recently diagnosed?,"I apologize for formatting in advance, I’m on mobile.

My boyfriend is 25 and was just released from the hospital yesterday. He was in DKA for weeks and was just diagnosed with Type 1. He is healthier than anyone I’ve known so this was a shock to him, myself, and his family.

I spent the most time I could with him in the hospital (apart from going to classes) and learned what they taught him about checking blood sugar and administering insulin. We still have a lot to learn when it comes to trying to stay in range and knowing how much insulin his body needs.

So far, he’s been struggling to get his sugars into the normal range. He has a Bluetooth compatible glucose monitor so he can keep a record of his readings. He’s hoping to get a CGM and an insulin pump at some point.

I’ve been trying to give him some emotional support, telling him that it’s okay to be upset and angry. He’s been in good spirits so far (when he was diagnosed he immediately asked his dad to order him a Wilford Brimley shirt and mug) but I know that what he shows on the outside probably doesn’t reflect what’s going on inside. I told him that I’ll be there for him for any support he needs.

I’d really like to know some advice and tips for people who have been recently diagnosed, and tips for loved ones who want to support him. Basically, any advice is welcome!

My family has also mentioned that there is autoimmune therapies they are doing to restore some pancreatic function, but I’m not sure if I want to overload my boyfriend with too much information. I think maybe for now he should just focus on how to get his sugars under control, and worry about other possibilities later.

"Thanks, Reddit community","A couple of days ago, I saw someone had posted that ketoacidosis was caused by a lack of insulin, and I'm going to admit here that I honestly didn't know that. I thought it was caused by high blood sugars. This explains why I've read that you can be in ketoacidosis when in normal range, and why you should continue to take insulin in you're sick. If they told us that at the hospital, I missed it with all of the other information we we getting.  I also never picked up on that in my readings after my daughter was diagnosed 2 years ago.

Absolutely livid!,"So a bit of background: 'Dave' has been diagnosed type 2, on Metformin, for about 2 months. 

I've been type 1 for 25 years.... 

So I was in a local coffee shop with my husband and our friend Dave (I use the term 'friend' loosely) earlier today. While I'm away from the table (at the bathroom) Dave says to my hubby that he's controlling his sugars really well unlike ""some people"" [and points to my seat]. My hubby was shocked and defended me and by the time I got back to my seat Dave was all chummy. My hubby told me about it later. 

I am (rightly/wrongly I don't care) absolutely fecking livid 😡. First of all, this is someone I consider a friend. Second of all, he's been diabetic for 5 minutes (which I'm not even sure he is - that's a story for another time) and all of a sudden he's all smug?! (I haven't bothered to enlighten him on the honeymoon phase yet lol). 

He's basically the type who will put all his diabetes equipment on the coffee table and make a big show of testing his blood sugar (you'd laugh if you saw the way he carries on) and has tried to give me advice on diabetes since he's been diagnosed.....(which seriously, feck off).

So i didnt think anything of it just went ahead and checked it to calibrate it and well fuck im 64. Clearly i didnt check it prior to eating like I thought and now im spazzing cause thats a lot of insulin that low. Im not sure what to do other then drinking juice or something and watching it.

Misdiagnosed,"

In March 2018, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was 19 years old and I was around 150lbs 5’6. I found it strange getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, being that I was young and at an average weight. My doctor first put me on metformin, which seemed to work for some time. I was able to get my blood sugar under control and my A1C down to 5.6. After receiving my results, I decided to stop taking metformin to see if I can get normal blood sugar readings without it and for some time they averaged between 80-120. Months go by, and my blood sugar is still at normal range without taking metformin, so I assume I don’t have diabetes anymore. A year goes by and I’m still doing fine. I feel normal. I’m still eating healthy and working out, but I’m not checking my blood sugar because I assume that I’m not a diabetic anymore. Then November 2019 comes around and I start feeling sick (internally). It’s an unexplainable feeling. I started losing weight. I went from 150 down to 118, within a span of a couple months. I started feeling more tired, to the point where I just wanted to sleep in all day. I felt like my life was being drained away. I dealt with this for another month, until I felt that it was time for me to go see a doctor. I decided to go to the ER on 12/30/2019. When I first arrived, my blood pressure was 140/80. I told the doctor my symptoms and they did a couple tests on me and told me I had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). For those of you who don’t know what DKA is, it’s basically a life threatening condition where my body produces excess acids in my blood (ketones) caused by my blood sugar being high for a long period of time. I was hospitalized for 4 days and was put on fluids with an insulin drip. At the hospital, they did several blood tests on me. My potassium was extremely low and My A1C was at 11. They also did a test to see if I was a type 1, because they found it strange that a type 2 was being treated for DKA, since DKA is more prevalent in people with type 1. They were testing  to see if I had pancreatic antibodies, and my results came up as positive. I’m assuming my doctors from 2 years ago didn’t do the pancreatic antibody test because it would have showed up as positive. I’m now feeling so much better now that I’m getting the proper treatment. Im currently taking insulin and eating less carbs/no sugar with a proper workout routine. My blood sugar isn’t quite at the range I want it to be, but day by day it’s getting better.

Steroid-induced diabetes vs Type 1 diabetes,"Hi T1 community,   


I had a kidney transplant ages ago for bad luck reasons (didn't have diabetes), and have been on a maintance dose of prednisolone (&lt;5mg) for about a decade. Recently, my new kidney started rejecting, so my prednisolone was increased to about 40mg every day. A few weeks later, I presented to the ED in pain and was found to have a blood sugar of 25 mmol/L (450 mg/dL). I was immediately put on an insulin 'sliding scale' and have since been discharged with NovoRapid and Levemir.   


They're treating me as a new Type 1 diabetic and seem to think that I will be on insulin permanently, even when my steroids are reduced back to the maintainance levels. I have seen no evidence that I am actually a new Type 1 diabetic, and that this isn't just a temporary steroid-induced event. My sugars were fine before. I've had GAD (negative), C Peptide (600s) and am negative to the insulin resistance antibodies. They're repeating C Peptide.   


**Does anyone here have any experience with working out how to differentiate between Type 1 and steroid-induced diabetes? Or had a high dose of steroids 'cause' Type 1?**   


What I'm hoping, is that I'll continue as a 'Type 1 diabetic' until my steroids are weaned down over the next few months, then I can stop taking insulin but still monitor blood sugar and see whether I fit a diabetic profile or a non-diabetic profile. The one doctor I've mentioned this to seemed reluctant, but I don't think they're used to dealing with people who have complicated medical histories prior to diagnosis.   


I just don't want lightning to have struck twice in the same place. I'm already 'the sick one', I don't want to be even sicker. I have so much respect for what Type 1s go through every day. This mental load is exhausting.

Is it me or is it my endo?,"
BACKGROUND INFO
Type 1 for about 3 years, was diagnosed in my 50s.
Have pretty much watched my carbs most of my adult life, so eating low carb to keep my BG under control was a natural.
My A1c has been 5.0 to 5.5 since day 1, and my  2 hours after meal readings are always between 5.0 and 8.0.
I do not bolus and only take basal insulin... long lasting lantus pen injected twice a day... total 20 units. 

THE STORY
I see my endo every 3 months, just last week was my 3-month appt. Told him I had a bad December and couldn't figure out why my 
daytime sugars had suddenly increased. My after meals BG, taken 2 hours after meals, had now increased to 10 or 11 after meals, and mornings I was waking up very low (3.2 to 4.0) in the morning, as I've been taking exactly the same amount of basal insulin for the last  3 years. Also told him I felt like I was fighting something, but wasn't really sick, just tired all the time. I also noted that my recent blood tests showed that my White Blood Cell count was slightly above normal, so I was probably fighting something.
I told him many other things of note, that this all started with the flu shot, but most of what I said was ignored.

HIS RESPONSE...
He suggests I stop taking nighttime insulin to avoid the lows...... he didn't suggest I increase my daytime basal insulin, and completely ignored the fact that I was probably sick and needed some antibiotics... it wouldn't be the first time where he would reply to me that he's not a GP.

I don't know, is it me or it is my Endo... does he just not give a f**k?

What are your experiences like?
Do you have a regular endo? (I'd switch, but hard enough to find a bad one, much less a good one)

There's no such thing as a Dexcom G5 transmitter.,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So, I switched insurance companies recently (thank you USA for your crappy insurance policy).

My G5 transmitter died with only a week's warning. I know, I should have paid better attention.

""You must be mistaken. The sensors that come with the G4 transmitter are labeled as G5, but they do not make a G5 transmitter."" -Crazy Lady

""No, the sensors are labeled as working with both the G4 and the G5 transmitters. I've been on the G5 for 2 years now, I think I know they exists."" -me

""I'm sorry ma'am, but you are mistaken."" -Crazy Lady

""Ok, so what do you say if I ask about the G6?"" -me, not wanting the G6, I want the G5 that I have sensors for.

""Yes, we also carry the G6 which I can help you ordering right now if you'd like."" -Crazy Lady

""I really wouldn't like the G6, I would like the G5."" -me

""I can get you G5 sensors, but we only carry the G4 and the G6 because Dexcom doesn't make a G5 transmitter."" -Crazy Lady

""I've had the G5 transmitter for two years now, and suddenly they don't make it?"" -me

Does anyone else experience dissociation because of diabetes related trauma?

So instead I’m going to make this incredibly specific in hopes that it relates strongly to at least one person. 

Ive gone through a lot of traumatic events as a t1 and because of it I experience frequent dissociation during stressful events. The most important being during lows. Because I find lows extremely stressful I’ll psych myself out and go into this rigid spaced out state where it’s difficult to process what’s going on around me. One can see why this would be dangerous during a low. This dissociation works itself into other situations I find stressful as well such as driving and being alone.

"Joint pain/problems due to type 1 diabetes, how to manage it? Advice is really welcome","Hi guys,

I'm a 23 yo female, got diagnosed with type 1 when I was 9 yo. Throughout the years I ended up many times in comas, ketoacidosis and so on. The complications are getting out of control since about 2-3ish years.  
I already have severe neuropathy in both feet, got wheelchair bound because of it since it made me unable to walk. 

Since about 4-5 months I also noticed I got more and more pain in the lower back, left hip and shoulders/hands. Small movements without pain killers are making life impossible, and even with pain meds it's really hard to manage life in general. My endo says it's most likely caused due to my diabetes, since it can cause a lot of damage to muscle/joint tissue, and since I already have so much damage in both feet/legs due to the diabetes... it's most likely.

Anyone else here with similar problems? And maybe advice in what to do to prevent/relieve some of the major pain issues? Currently using tramadol but I'm now building the opiate off since it makes me more tired than I'm already am. I really want to discuss tomorrow with my doc on other pain relief suggestions that don't involve opiates so I can live my life a bit more easy without constantly being sleepy/high af. It's choosing between 2 demons now; having manageable pain and not being able to do shit, or being in awful pain but still having some minutes in a day to talk with a friend.",diabetes_t1,1579095833,spooniextubie,9,1,True,2020-01-15

Need someone to share in my excitement,"TL;DR at bottom
My 7 year old was diagnosed type 1  two weeks before Christmas. Then a week later my EBF baby was declared allergic to milk and soy. Since then I've been mentally composing a post to this sub asking for advice from other parents of types 1s or those that were diagnosed in childhood. I haven't done it though, I've just lurked and tried to google-fu my way through figuring things out.

I was keto for a long time, and so I've tried making a ton of different low carb things for her to eat, so that she could have tasty snacks between meals that fit the criteria her endo set. Ya know, beyond, ""go eat a cheese stick/meat stick"". She has declared hate for most of them (usually after learning they contain ingredients her father is allergic to).

Her school nurse has asked that we drop off granola bars or some snack that is 10-15 carbs and at least 7 grams protein for a morning snack as she keeps dipping so low. AFAIK no such bar exists unless we're talking about net carbs, which we aren't. 

Today at the store not only did I find a yogurt that is dairy AND soy free (I've been living off trail mix and roasted veggies) but I also found yogurt that is 3 grams of carbs and 12 grams protein! My husband was rather nonplussed when I told him but I am so excited to find something that fits our needs! It feels like the universe cut me a tiny slice of a break.

Disappointed with Tandem’s control IQ announcement video.,"In their livestream (which you can see on tandems Facebook page) they explained that you can only have Control IQ OR Basal IQ. 

“If you already have a tslim x2 pump with Basal-IQ technology, once you update your pump software to Control-IQ technology, you will no longer have access to Basal-IQ technology, or the ability to revert to a previous version of pump software.”

So not only do you have to choose one of the two IQ algorithms, once you update from basal to control, you can’t revert it back to basal iq. I thought they would work together at the same time, doesn’t that make the most sense? I supposed this would have to go through another stage of trials for FDA approval.

Tips/Advice for getting a CGM?,"Hello!

Sorry if I don’t have my diabetes terms all right but I try to learn and understand as much as I can about T1!

My wife is a type one and years ago (maybe over 5 years ago) she had a dexcom glucose monitor. She loved being able to monitor the trend of her glucose levels at all times. Unfortunately, due to costs we could not continue with it so she went back to the standard finger prick and monitor method and delivering insulting via syringe. She’s able to manage, but she definitely talks about the convenience of the CGM

Recently, she landed a great job opportunity where the employer offered GREAT insurance. With a combination of better insurance and more income, she’s really hoping to get back to having a CGM. Since it’s been a long time since she got one, I imagine that technology has gotten so much better for this type of stuff. We’ve even heard of being able to sync it to an Apple Watch and all that, which is mind blowing to us!

I’m writing this to see if someone could give us a crash course ON what is all needed to get her started.  Any recommendations would be great! With this new job, I’d love to get an Apple Watch for her as a congratulation gift to get her one step closer to having the CGM, but outside of that, I don’t know what else she needs. I think having some type of step by step will help not feel overwhelming.

"Hey guys, quick question. Does anyone else find it hard to use the bathroom whenever their blood sugar is low?"," Like I’ll walk into the bathroom, stall or urinal, and I simply can’t piss and/or shit. I will have the urge to use the bathroom but it is physically impossible for me to do so... I don’t think it’s because of a separate issue but it’s sure annoying as any blood sugar reading that is below 105 will put me into this position. I’ve started to get really anxious whenever I go to the bathroom because I’m fearful that I just won’t be able to go and I’ll embarrass myself. I’ve already had one incident in my high school where I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I walked to the bathroom, in a rush, and sat down. Low and behold, I can’t use the bathroom. I was the only person in the bathroom at the time but then I begin hearing footsteps. Then I hear a stern, adult, voice. “I know your vaping in here you didn’t even use the bathroom.” My adrenaline began pumping, I wasn’t vaping. I was just unable to get myself to use the bathroom. Because of how “in the moment” I was, I never even thought to look at my blood sugar (Dexcom G6 by the way). The adult was an assistant principal. I walked out and in a regular toned voice (because I didn’t want an entire hall to know that I was struggling to use the bathroom) told him I was just having a hard time going. He thought I was trying to make him look stupid so he took me down to the office and had a school resource officer search me and my bag. They didn’t find anything they thought I had and sent me back to class. Afterwards, I decided to look at my blood sugar from that time and noticed I was a steady 55 the entire time.

Pump site and restless sleep,"I roll in my sleep quite a bit and I have my pump site on my sides or near.

Developing extreme hypo anxiety,"Hi all! I'm wondering if there are any others out there in this community who have struggled or who are struggling with extreme anxiety around lows. I've had pretty extreme lows in the past (32mg/dL was my lowest) but have never had the anxiety before that I have now, which seems to have developed just in the past few weeks.

I use a G6 and when I see that I'm trending downward, even if I'm at a high number, I start to feel like I'm spiraling a bit. My head tingles, I feel a bit in my stomach, and I feel a surge of adrenaline. I become so panicked that I'm not going to catch the fall in time or, I know, extremely illogical, that the sugar just isn't going to work (it sounds ridiculous as I type it out). Because of this, I've definitely been riding higher lately and I'm not sure how to break this anxiety-cycle.

Just ranting.,"

I was made to feel uncomfortable at work and now I am struggling to eat in front of my coworkers. 

On friday, a coworker and I walked down the street to get a burger. When I came back and sat in the teacher's lounge, one of the janitors said ""hey brittany I have something to show you!"" Before I even set my food down to eat. She handed me her phone and she had googled ""foods type one diabetics should avoid"" and went on to list things to me. I'm not sure what her aim was seeing as I had just sat down to eat but I was a little taken back. I told her I see a doctor, I've spoken to nutritionists, and that just like anyone else my diet is supposed to be balanced. She replied kind of snarkily about how google said I shouldn't be eating these things at all. 

I kind of brushed it off but it did hurt my feelings and I guess word went around because it was brought up between my boss and I and she was very upset for me. After talking to her about it, I realized how rude that encounter really was. When it came time to eat today, I suddenly got nervous and ended up skipping lunch altogether. I know it's stupid, but I'm feeling self conscious and like people pay attention to what I'm eating as well as talking about my health issues behind my back. 

I have decided to start walking to the art building during lunch and eat with the art teacher since she doesn't eat in the lounge but I'm bummed.

Strategy for long trip off-grid with Omnipod (DASH) and Dexcom G6,"My son is looking at doing a high adventure camp with BSA, which will put him off-grid for 8 days or so. He uses the Omnipod DASH and Dexcom G6.

I would be joining him on this adventure.

He will be on horseback for 6 days.

I believe there will be no opportunities to charge devices while on the trail.

Concerns:

Alarms spooking the horses. Anyone with horses care to weigh in?
Power for charging DASH/Dexcom receiver/Phone. I think we'd use his phone, and I can keep the dexcom receiver so I can view his sugars, at least when we're nearby. 

Thoughts:

Get a couple of high capacity power banks and a solar charger; put a spare high capacity power bank in the midweek resupply.
Bring two vials of humalog and a vial of lantus, in Frio pouches. Spare humalog just in case a vial breaks. Lantus in case the PDM goes off a cliff or gets stepped on by a horse.
I'd prefer to keep with the pump since temporary basals are SO helpful. We might try a pump vacation at some point to practice MDI again (it's been a couple of years).
A small bag, pulley, and paracord to put snacks in separate from the bear bag to quickly get sugars at 2am when he tanks

A Thank You Letter to all of you...,"This will be my 13th year with type 1. I was diagnosed when I was 10. Spent majority of my childhood feeling out of place and weird. Didn’t have any people who I could relate to or discuss diabetes with. A lot of times, even our endocrinologists and diabetic nurses can’t understand the emotional and mental strain this autoimmune disease has on us. 

A lot of us are the only ones in our family who are type ones. And those who don’t have the disease think that simply creating and following a structure makes it an “easy illness”. That we shouldn’t complain or be frustrated because we’re not going to die if we do what needs to be done.

However, living and managing type one diabetes goes against the way we naturally should live life. People don’t wake up and worry about what their BGs are or if they are calculating the right amount of insulin to properly break down the sugar in the foods they consume. They don’t get worried about their blood sugar going high and entering DKA or running low in their sleep and potentially entering a comma.

I found this reddit group about 6 months ago. Reading all the questions, comments, comedy, and outright support made me cry. And I just wanted to say thank you. I don’t know any of you, and I probably never will... but this group lifted a huge weight off my shoulder. I’ve always felt like my illness was my burden. And because I’ve never met or seen anybody with it, it became a heavy weight to carry. 

But knowing that there are so many people out there who have the same questions and concerns... who sometimes make the same choices (whether good or bad) makes me grateful that I’ve found this community. We’re actually some of the strongest people out there. To wake up everyday, and not have diabetes define who we are as humans... I’m proud of all of us.

Find a friend Friday thread + subreddit update,"This is a find a friend Friday thread. Here you can look for people to have conversations with about diabetes or life in general. If you want to try it tell us a bit about yourself(but not too much) and tell us who you are looking for.

Over the past couple of weeks we sporadically discussed some ways to improve the community aspect of this subreddit. We talked about a lot of ideas but this concept should be the easiest for the user. We will host these threads every 2-4 weeks depending on how many they are used and the thread will stay up for 3 days.

**Discord**

We also talked about a Discord a lot. There were many different opinions on it but in the end it is probably best to share one with /r/diabetes. Competing with them would only split up the community. Come say hi at [http://discord.gg/diabtes](http://discord.gg/diabtes) 

**Rules**

In the other news, we made some slight changes to the rules. But don't worry, they will hardly affect the average user at all.

We do no longer allow surveys to be posted for research. Going over them with the researcher to verify their integrity and their goals took a long time. We would often exchange several long messages about the survey. And while I certainly didn't mind doing that it seems that it just isn't worth it. Whenever a survey did get approved nobody was interested in them and they would barely get any comments, upvotes or responses. Understandably so, as someone with diabetes you probably get asked to fill in a survey a lot. If this is something the community doesn't want then the lengthy approval process.

We put up a few rules for content creators and influencers. It's still allowed but it must be kept to reasonable levels. Content creators should also link to their content directly, not just to their profiles. Post that were simply asking for followers/subscribers because the owner of the profile has type 1 diabetes are no longer allowed.

And finally we set up some guidelines for posting CGM graphs. These are posted quite frequently and they will continue to be allowed but very low effort ones may be removed. The graphs must be accompanied by some context, what are we looking at, what is happening, what is going wrong/good? It should also be clear what the scale of the graph is. Sometimes a graph is posted that doesn't include any numbers at all. And we can't possibly see whether their blood sugar at that moment is 100 mg/dL or 200 mg/dL. Letting us know in the comments is also an option.",diabetes_t1,1578657102,Adamantaimai,12,1,True,2020-01-10

"Newly diagnosed, basal insulin question!","Hi there! I am a 25 year old female who just got a diagnosis on January 2nd 2020. It’s a lot to take in but I’m managing. Right now my doctor has me focusing on getting my fasting sugar into the normal range. I’m in the process of dealing with the insurance company to get a cgm, but since it’ll take a few weeks to get sorted, for now I’m testing 4 times a day (and if I feel high/low) and using a fast-acting pen when I do. I use toujeo as my long-acting pen, right now just in the mornings, which is what my question is about. 

I know everyone’s experience is different and varies with body types, etc., but I am wondering what an average basal dose is? My doctor started me on 10u and said to increase 1-2 units every 3 days if my fasting sugar is above 150. I’ve only been doing this for a week, but I’m at 14u now and have yet to be under 200 in the mornings. I’m wondering if this is typical for a newly diagnosed patient, if it goes up or down from here, and what everyone else takes. In case it matters, I’m 5’6”, and usually weigh around 145 (though I did just drop 15 pounds which led to my diagnosis). I’ve been really focused on eating fewer carbs and healthier ones when I do, which isn’t a huge change from my diet before.

THE DIABETES SOLUTION,"### But there’s hope – Diabetes type 2 can be reversed!

According to an ever-growing body of research – a landmark 2016 study found that Diabetes type 2 could be reversed with following a specific 3 phase plan. Reversing Diabetes is no longer a possibility ? it's a reality.

Scientists, who carried out the study on 238 patients, found that their approach led to dramatic improvements. Half of their patients saw their condition reversed after just 10 weeks and were able to reduce or stop taking Diabetes drugs. 89% of those in the study, who had been reliant on insulin due to the severity of their disease, were able to dramatically reduce or stop taking it.

One of the researchers behind this study – Professor Hallberg said that the standard advice for Diabetes patients needs to be changed because she believes Type 2 can be reversed, in many if not most situations, especially if treated early. Science has confirmed that there is only one way to freedom from this horrible condition. The most effective solution – a 3 phase strategy to reversing Diabetes was used with awe-inspiring 90% success rate.

The most important conclusion of all the research is this: developing a tailored program leads to providing each patient with the maximum perception of improvement. According to the latest science there's a way out from symptoms and potential complications of Diabetes.

New and still learning.. support would be nice..,"Hello reddit users and other T1D I am new to the reddit thing and I’ve basically been looking for support since I’ve been diagnosed... all my family members who have had T1D are no longer with us so I’m fighting this by myself and blindly. 

So let me just say that my father was diagnosed at 25 and he never took it seriously and it took his life. My grandmother (moms side) got diagnosed at like 60? Due to a car accident. Through out my life i was warned about this disease and so were my brothers, of course like the rest of us I ignored it and kept being a kid eating anything and everything. My life hasn’t been very great and a lot of it I couldn’t help because I was a kid, I’m currently 23 years old right now. Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night. You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles? Yeah I’d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes. I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day, l was even craving the most random things I’ve never craved before.. after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant! So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said “your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you’re under DKA” all I could say was ok. I called my mom and said “mom I’m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly...I have diabetes.” There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry. I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room. Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here. I don’t have insurance and my job isn’t very good, they’ve cut my hours because of how sick I’ve been. I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn’t listen to me.. she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin (Levemir, Novolog) at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM, over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm. After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir... my sugars were still sitting in the 380 - 420 I kept begging her that it’s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I’m killing myself rather than helping myself.. I ended up losing about 30+ pounds in 3 months. I was 145 lbs before diagnosed, today 1/9/2020 I’m now 114lbs and not happy at all... I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels, for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I’m not even financially stabled or have insurance. On 1/4/2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out, turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 (in June it was at 7.5) thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that’s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus! Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that’s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir ... so even when I was injecting myself with insulin.....nothing was happening ... to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I’ve been using Levemir it wasn’t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I’m doing everything I can possibly do... I want to be apart of this community and have people I can talk to when things get overwhelming, my boyfriend is my supporter but he still doesn’t fully understand how much this effects someone, is there anyone else how there who struggles to live daily because they aren’t stable I’m tired of feeling alone with this stupid sickness.",diabetes_t1,1578619285,SammieT1D,17,1,True,2020-01-09

Do you guys ever just feel really really overwhelmed,"I do my best, but sometimes I just get so damn tired of dealing with diabetes — not just with the physical impact of the disease itself, but with the excessive maintenance; the exorbitant cost of supplies and doctor’s appointments; the constant worry, obsession, and fear; the need to explain myself/justify my decisions to both myself and other people; the guilt for wanting to just eat and drink sometimes—the desire to not have to account for every small impulse I have as a human; the frustration with having to remember so many rules for my body and so many passwords for online systems and this relentless, daily interrogation by alerts, alarms, and data that I cannot help but equate to my sense of self-worth. 

It takes up so much head space. I’m 27, almost 28, and it’s been about 15 years now with this chaos. I like life: I’m living in New York and have a cute cat and a good job in book publishing and love doing art projects and going on little adventures and spending time with my friends, but holy hell, it is NEVER going to go away. And that fact makes me wonder how much longer I can do this. I mean, I know I’m capable. I’ve been dealing with it for 15 years, moderately well (but not great) and I can continue to deal with it in this way, but the truth is, I don’t know how much longer I WANT to.

Ive been a type 1 diabetic for 23 years. Im 30 now. I never had a focused career path but over the years I always felt that being a chef was my true calling. I managed to get offered a trial shift as a Kitchen Porter for a restaurant that is at the top of the list for all restaurants id like to work at.

I understand working in a professional kitchen is a very fast-paced job and intense. I wonder if I will be able to manage being a Kitchen Porter with my diabetes, for example, if I go into a hypo there will be no time for me to stop washing dishes and take off my gloves and take a candy from my pocket to eat, as I feel this will slow down service and this is a restaurant where they really work at the highest standards. I feel if i mention my diabetes they wont hire me. 

I was also recently diagnosed with neuropathy in my hands so I wonder if this will also be affected since my hands will be in hot water most of the day and become extremely wrinkly for the whole day.

TLDR: I am looking for study participants who have experience with treating chronic pain with psychedelic drugs.

I am a PhD student studying the effects of classic psychedelics (LSD/psilocybin/DMT) on chronic pain. Thus far research in the field is extremely sparse; beyond a handful of studies in the 60s and limited work on headaches there is very little formal information regarding the effects of psychedelic drugs on chronic pain. As millennials tend to do, I've turned to the internet for more information and I’ve found some extremely helpful content on Reddit – thank you!

Part of my PhD project is interviewing *people who have in the past or are currently treating pain with psychedelics*, in order to understand the phenomenon better. My goal is to gain an understanding of the general topography of self medication in this sphere. I will then use the knowledge gleaned from this to shape future research questions and inform the direction of future clinical trials. All personal data will of course be kept strictly confidential.

I am curious if any of you are interested in helping me with this study? The whole process would not take longer than an hour or so and would provide me with valuable data :) You can be anywhere in the world, all that is necessary is an internet connection and skype/zoom/etc. If this is something you'd be interested in, please let me know!

Love to all",diabetes_t1,1578493323,ziggyshroomdust,2,1,True,2020-01-08
Question about the onset of your T1,"My son is 6. He has an uncle and a grandfather that both have T1 diabetes. As such, I am very concerned about watching for indications that he could develop T1 diabetes. 

Recently, he has become super irritable, fatigued (he says after he eats he gets tired), he throws up after exercise or play, I swear his breath is fruity smelling (but what do I know, I’m probably paranoid). He is always talking about how his stomach hurts. (Could be anxiety.)

He is naturally thin, to the point of skin and bones and NEVER wants to eat because it’s a little control game that he plays about what I serve but when he does eat he devours everything in his path. He does not seem to drink excessively or pee more than usual but I don’t know about what’s happening at school. 

Anyway, his father (who has lived with diabetic family members his whole life) seems unconcerned but to be fair, he sort of lives in an optimistic world where nothing ever goes wrong. 

He says that his family members developed T1 after a significant illness and that their immune systems went haywire after a flu or a bout with the mumps. And that I have no cause for concern. 

How did your T1 reveal itself? Were thirst and hunger a huge part of your symptoms? Are there any of you whole developed this without those features? I am sorry to ask, I just have this creeping suspicion that something is wrong and don’t think doctors will take it seriously because two tell-tale (hunger, thirst) signs are not immediately clear. Should I just insist they test him and take a risk that insurance won’t cover it? Oye.

The doctor walked in and asked what brought me in. I said, ""First things first, I am a type 1 diabetic, but I hate telling doctors that because-"" She cut me off to finish my sentence, ""they automatically assume that's the cause of your issue."" She went on to check me out and take an xray. I told her I appreciated that she wasn't just chalking it up to diabetes. She told me that most type ones who come in experiencing foot pain/ burning/ numbness aren't caused by neuropathy. There's a lot of little parts of the foot and we beat the heck out of them everyday.

So as the title might give away I have a question about my type 1 diabetes when I go traveling.

I have never been abroad before and so just want to know if there is anything special I need to do before going on a plane and going through customs with regards to my diabetes equipment.

I usually carry round a bottle of lucosade wherever I go, but I understand the liquid restrictions on the flights so instead am opting to carry some Dextros tablets (should I go low when on my holiday). Will customs want to take these or will they be ok?

&amp;#x200B;

Along side this do I need to do or bring anything to prove I am diabetic and such if they question the needles and insulin viles?

How often do you do blood tests?,"Hi

I have the freestyle libre, currently using blood strips exclusively.

At a hospital appointment today (my first - diagnosed 2 months ago) they looked at all my blood test readings and seemed surprised at how many I do every day - around 8-10 tests. Apparently that's highly unusual, and 'unattainable' for most people. (It also automatically qualifies me for prescribed libre sensors, which I'm guessing is more economic for the NHS in the long run than the 300 test strips I'd be using otherwise.)

I just wondered if any other Type 1s who have been on blood strips alone could weigh in, since I'd thought I was being pretty moderate about it. I couldn't imagine only testing four times a day - it's my health, so I'm going to want to keep track of it, right? Or is 10 tests a day excessive?

Medication caused type 1 diabetes? please read.,"This might cause a debate, but hear me out, i’m not here to offend anyone or make fun of it by any means, cause i am a type one diabetic now since beginning of 2017. Back in December of 2016, on the 16th, i was approached by 2 males who asked me to use my phone cause they were lost, i said sure. I handed them my phone, afterwards they proceeded to tell me to empty my pockets. At first i was confused, then i realized i was being robbed. They had no weapon out at the time, but they tried to cover their face after i already seen their faces when they asked to use my phone. I’m a brown belt in karate and blue belt in brazilian jiu-jitsu, i felt like i could more than handle these guys. I threw a punch, knocked out the first guy and took the other guy down and started fighting him on the ground, 20 or so seconds go by and i felt a sharp kind of hit to the top of my head, my shoulder, my lower back, stomach, arms, at first i thought it was some brass studded knuckles, but they both got up and ran. I realized what had just happened, i was stabbed multiple times. I was very lucky to run 3 blocks to the hospital with a collapsed lung, i made it. I fell unconscious from blood loss in the front entrance of the hospital and nurses saw me and i was wheelchaired in. I woke up to many nurses and doctors working on stitching me up and pumping blood into me. Fast forward to next day. I was told the severity of the stabbing, i was stabbed 3 times in the cranium, once in the lung, 3 times in my back (they just missed my L4 &amp;amp; L5 vertebrae’s) which i would of lost all motor mobility of my body, i was also stabbed in the hand, arm, shoulder, and the back of my neck. I needed brain surgery, a piece of the knife was imbedded into my skull and JUST millimetres from my brain. Surgery went great, i recovered and took me about 3 weeks before i was discharged. fast forward about one month, i started having pains on the top of my head where i had surgery, i went to the hospital and i had a very rare blood infection in my body from the dirty knife i was stabbed with. (hunting blade) and i needed to take IV medication everyday for 2 hours, they told me if i don’t take it, there’s a 90% chance i’ll die from this infection, but this medication had side effects, i didn’t want to hear it, i was too stressed out at that point. I did the IV medication for nearly 6 weeks, the infection was gone from my body. Fast forward 1 month, i’m back living with my parents, i was always tired, sleeping, no appetite and short of breath. My mom is type 2, she tested my BG and it was 27.0 mmol. She took me to the hospital right away, i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 20, weight 210, 6’2, i was healthy, ate normal, and lived a normal life. I’m now a type 1 diabetic, forever. I want opinions or to hear any feedback on this, i’m not blaming it on the medication i took, but it’s a big chance it was. Thank you for reading.",diabetes_t1,1578215023,IlRequ,42,1,True,2020-01-05

What is your most proud moment as a type 1 diabetic?,To get the ball rolling I’ll give mine. Was diagnosed with an A1c of 9 at the age of 11. Was extremely independent with the disease which is a blessing and curse. My parents couldn’t support me because they didn’t understand the disease well enough and I didn’t let them. Quickly after my diagnosis I developed a strong fear of low blood sugar that sent my numbers sky rocketing. I believe I my A1c hit 13 at one point. It took me 6 years and I finally got my A1c back to a 9. Slowly working my way down after 10 and a half years to an A1c of 7 that I’m ridiculously proud of. But walking in to my endo telling me my A1c was 9 after 6 years of 10+ was really something.

I was hoping to get some feedback on what the best time to dose basal was. I have been T1D since 2014 and used Lantus everyday for about three years before switching to Tresiba.

Recently, I have been trying to get on an earlier sleep schedule and was thinking that if I started taking my basal when I wake up in the morning it would be a good incentive to get up, otherwise face sleeping in and waking up with a high BG. I also just wanted a general opinion on when you all take your doses and the reasoning. 

Hope you all have a great day and thanks for taking the time.

"T1D, PCOS, and Birth Control?","Hello!  Question for fellow female T1s...

So T1D for 18 years, I’m 30 now.  I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and my doc suggested Birth Control as treatment.  Well I was hesitant and brought up that I have always avoided BC (because hormones) and had been told by other docs in the past that it could affect my blood sugar and increase insulin resistance. She told me to discuss at my next Endo appointment since I was worried.

Well I did.  My current Endo said what I was told previously was incorrect and that BC should have no effect on blood glucose levels or insulin resistance, and she agreed I should start. So doc prescribed it.  I’ve been on it 2 weeks now, and have seen consistent highs.  In fact, I’ve had my basal rate on a 40-60% INCREASE for the majority of the past 2 weeks trying to stay in range and still have stubborn highs.  I’ve had to take extra correction doses after any meal, which I never required before.  I have been a little sick, just for the past couple days though not the whole time, but I can’t be certain that the only difference is the BC.  I have a strong suspicion that it’s part of the problem though...

So my question is - anyone else notice high blood sugar or increased insulin needs while on birth control?",diabetes_t1,1578193778,t1_diabuddy,21,2,True,2020-01-04

I'm enrolled on my partner's work health care plan now, which is by Anthem Blue Cross (we did think initially this was Blue Shield). The plan cost $28 a month for my partner, but once I was added on the price unexpectedly went up to ~$250. This is even before getting any medication. My partner works part time, and I'm unable to work until I get my paperwork from the government, and even then who knows how long it will take for me to find work. Since I couldn't enroll in medicare we figured the only option was to go with the work benefits.



They wouldn't tell us their formulary before signing up and we had to wait until coverage started yesterday. Upon looking, most insulins are not covered. **I am currently on Novorapid (Novolog in the US I think?) and Tresiba, both of which are listed as 'EXCLUDED' on the formulary. Humalog and Lantus are listed, however, are these the closest comparable insulins? Which combination would you recommend?**



I feel really bad about how much this plan will take from my partner's pay cheque, so I was considering outright getting private coverage out of my own pocket. **Are there any good / more affordable plans out there? Or am I better sticking with my partner's coverage?** I did look at Blue Shield but I have to call to get a quote. Unfortunately, this whole thing is incredibly stressful and confusing and the only area I've kind of felt out of my depth and I keep getting more questions and I'm not sure where to head to have them answered.



A few other things,


* Our understanding is we need to set up a primary care doctor first, discuss with them what I need, and they refer me to an Endo who is in our network, who then will write a prescription for me and I go and take that to a pharmacy. Is this correct?



* What would be the correct course of action for going via a community pharmacy for 340b prices? Follow the same steps as above, and then sign up at the local community health centre?



* Could the endo add things to the prescription that aren't listed on the formulary and I still get coverage, or is that just up to me to pay the full amount? CGMs are on the formulary as 'non-preferred', if I filled out the FreeStyle Libre form on their website, and got a prescription, do I still have to pay full price for the sensors, for example?



* Which insulins have manufacturer discounts? I think most of the Novo Nordisk ones have them available, but it doesn't seem like these are covered by my insurance.

Looking for T1s doing cutting/recomposing,"Hello there!

I’m a F30, SW: 72-74kgs, CW: 68kgs, GW: 62kgs, T1 diabetic, celiac and trying to get into vegetarian lifestyle. My goals are getting healthier in terms of BMI (would like to be around 21) and reduce body fat while toning up my appearance to be leaner. 

Currently reshaping my calories goals (seems like I’ve been undereating a bit, I was trying to do 1,200-1,400) I would like to cut 
the last kgs and starting recomposing once I reach 63-64kgs.

In terms of macros, I tend to go on a low-carb (60-90grs/day). I’m really new to all of this macros aspect and protein is the aspect I currently struggle more with.

It’s a lot to juggle. My situation is fairly specific so I’m lacking resources (specially trust-worthy ones) and I don’t count with a person I could ask for advice in my gym. I am looking for advice regarding what type of training I could do and how to combine that food-wise to hold my sugar levels while training. 

I think understand the dynamics between my workout, diet and diabetes is key to not get myself into a loop of having to consume 171-200cal (with 40-50grs of carbs) every time I workout.

Blood sugars unexplainably terrible?,"Hi all! Been a diabetic for almost 20 years so usually I know what I’m doing alright, but recently ran into a problem. I have been trying to get a pump for about 10 years now, but have had many problems do to insurance and money and all kinds of things. I’ve finally got a new job with really good insurance (that pays terribly but that’s a complaint for r/antiwork ha!)  I have an appointment with Endo at end of month all well and good. In my state however to get an insulin pump even with insurance you need 3 months of logged blood sugar results (at least 4 a day) and an A1C of under 7. I test closer to 10 times a day so not a problem there, and for months my blood sugar has been where it needed to be with an average of about 135 since about June. I have been working hard to keep it that way to get my pump, hence the 10 tests a day (strips without insurance are a bitch). However lately (most of December I’d say) despite doing everything the exact same as I have been doing, I’ve been running outrageously high for no reason. I even upped my lantus from 20u a day to 25u (didn’t want to go too drastic because I know going too high can actually cause you to run higher!). Using same ratios I’ve been using that was keeping me fine seems to just not be working anymore.  I’m constantly over 250 now. Just this morning I woke up at 248, gave 5 units (according to ratio I should have given 2) went back to bed woke up an hour later and was 313. I’d say maybe it could be  sickness but it’s been about a month of this constant high blood sugars. I can’t see endo till end of month and I’d actually prefer to get handled before I see him so I can immediately show him my GOOD results and get pump as quick as possible. Any help would be very appreciated. I’m just lost here and don’t know what happened!

Diabetes Burnout Myth,"Diabetes burnout is a myth. It doesn’t exist. 

Before I explain, I’ve been doing this a long time.... 34 years on multiple daily injections, and a few years ago an A1c of 7.5%. Switched insulins, from Humalog to Fiasp, Tresiba instead of Lantus, and used Libre for 18 months, down to 6.6%. 

I’m in software development, so maybe I should be all over it, but for whatever reason, I’ve kept my nose out of social media or Reddit reading up on people’s diabetes thoughts.  This is my thing to deal with, not others. I didn’t want to burden anyone on my whinging about it. Whatever I’d been doing through the decades worked. 

Three months ago I started following beyondtype1 on Twitter, and it seemed to be a floodgate of people claiming healthcare sucks because they can’t get a pump and that will change everything for them. 

Also, most do not understand the constant burnout of being a type 1.

Burnout?  What on earth are people talking about?  A clumsy pump will change things?  I put my head down at 10:30, wake up at 8, and carry on. There’s nothing all that complicated or stressful about doing a quick sugar check, and hit yourself up with either some food or bit extra fast acting insulin. People in mad panics about lows... I don’t understand the reactions.  You get to eat.  Are people just scrambling for some sort of sympathy vote?

I’ve recently switched to Dexcom, because the Libre results didn’t seem right. Very high level of error. I’d flatline most nights, or crazy highs out of nowhere, and convinced I was having lows during the day but not noticing. 

So, I’ve switched, and, according to Dexcom so far, I’ve managed an A1c of 5.5%. No pump.  Inject four to six times a day, done. But... I’ve after many decades experienced my first burnouts over these past 40 days.  It is that specific device that has caused it. 

Therefore, I contend diabetes burnout does NOT exist. It is Dexcom burnout. 

How many freaking nights have I been woken up for hours on end due to lows or the occasional high?  Christmas morning I had maybe 2.5 hours of sleep dealing with stupid constant low alarms. 

Dexcom is the single greatest tool a T1 can have to get sugar under good control, pump be damned. Just be prepared to be burned out some nights because of it specifically.

Anyone else feeling dread over the fact insurances reset today?,"I guess this is mostly only valid for those of us in the USA? Since most other places have affordable healthcare... I wish we did too. Just the thought of how much money I'm going to have to find to afford my insulin is causing me so much stress. Luckily I found a plan that once I hit my deductible most things will be free for me like doctor visits and medications, so it's a good-ish plan. I just don't know how I'm going to afford the deductible since I'm so poor already. Insulin is probably going to be over $1,000 the first time I need it and typing that out alone brings me to the verge of tears. I don't want to be the next person with an article written about them dying because they rationed their insulin...

Should I worry more about my diabete for my own health's sake?,"So here's the thing. I (20F) got diagnosed with T1D 5 years ago. Overall my diabete has been pretty well balanced according to my specialists (overall being the keyword here). I've never lost conscious and my ""records"" are probably around -20 and +500. Of course I do feel bad in these cases but generally, I don't really feel the high sugar (starting around 180 in my standards) and don't do a lot of low sugar (less than 60). 

Here is the thing. When I first got hospitalized, I was told about low or highs being dangerous but either the medics were too positive, either was I? I ended up not really considering diabete as ""risky"". Actually I was only clearly told one can die of low sugar when one of my devices has a serial problem so everyone who might be concerned received a mail about it where they mentioned lows can be deadly. And this was like, a few years after my diagnosis? And yea, since my diabete remains quite equilibrate most of the time it does not really help taking it seriously.

Lately I've been wondering if I'm being too ""unworried"" about my diabete. I mean, I got drunk the other night had a total blackout and I never thought about my diabete before doing it? (I ended up surprisingly fine , when I checked my glucose scores in the morning they were completely normal and since no one at the party knew how to use my devices I guess I still handled my diabete when drunk?) Sometimes I also eat shit tons of candies or other highly sugary snacks without caring about my diabete and just check myself frequently afterwards to inject more if I need it , but don't really mind getting high sugar for a time. I'm also supposed to change my maths settings for the basal and bolus but have been too lazy to do it so I try to calculate it myself by decreasing the number my device advises me, but very often mess it up.

Am I being too ""cool"" about my diabete? Should I worry my lack of care strikes back to me one day? And if so, what could I do to change this? I mean just telling me to stop eating lots of sugar or drink at all would be too much asked so what in between could I find?

Anyone else feel like they can't reach their full life potential?,"I am 22 years old got diagnosed when I was 15 years old ever since then I'm failing at things in life. I was diagnosed at one of the happiest points of my life school was great, got selected into the soccer team and even my academics were great. Used to be pretty outgoing and really social but these 7 years have been really hard. Diabetes is one thing never really felt so bad that I had to take injections daily or so realized it could have been much worse,that some people have very less to go on, people who are blind,handicapped and shit. But, with diabetes it's constant worry of highs and lows and no matter how much you try to ignore and go on with your life it'll always be there. Because of this not being able to do the simplest of tasks every day, I remember my first exams after being diagnosed i wrote pretty well for some time then looked up for a second and everything was blurred and slowly started realizing that my memory was not it used to be. I couldn't remember basic shit during the exam and made so many silly mistakes during exams.Get constant brain fogs. Don't know if it is the pressure or what. Even playing sports became really difficult the constant worry of a low and the fact that I was not able to give my best performance on a high and it's correction and lot of body pains has really been tough to deal with.

Now after diabetes I've really changed as a person became very introverted, socially awkward. College was really difficult and at the end of it all my friends are getting jobs and are doing something in their life while I just am afraid to fail and do nothing. No one around me understands the shit we have to deal with and started to see me as a failure. My parents keep comparing me with others (typical of any Indian parents I assume) and it makes me feel bad like will I ever account to something. I've been depressed and diagnosed with anxiety and have been taking meds for it even tho it helps a bit I still don't feel any better.

2.) Can you perceive low/high blood sugars without checking them? For me high blood sugars are slightly harder to detect. 

3.) In your opinion, If you rely on a CGM, do you get better or worse at feeling what your blood sugar is? Do you feel lost if you don't have access to it for a while?

Is there anything I can do to get new sensors for free since mine have all been faulty?,"I use the Freestyle Libre 14 day sensors and my last 3 have all stopped working with 7 days. I’ve never had this issue before, but with paying $75/sensor I simply can’t keep this up, and I’m honestly infuriated with the company because the conspiracy theorist in me feels like this is on purpose just to milk more money from me. 

Does anybody know if there is something I can do to get Abbott to replace them? The sensor isn’t pulling out of my arm or anything, and they will always work perfectly and then 5 minutes later just stop. It’s always when my bloodsugar goes low for some stupid reason. And when I was on the 10 day sensor I would get a thing saying it was having troubles and to try again in 15 min occasionally but these last few have just completely shut down. No “try again later” just a giant screw you it has to be replaced even though it hasn’t even lasted for half the time it’s supposed to.

My thoughts on Control IQ vs DIY Looping,"Okay, so I have been using Tandem's Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, before this experiment, I was DIY looping with Omnipod (off-label). Being off-label, this system has it's quirks, but there are a couple features, intensity, and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before jumping into what I like and don't like about Control IQ, I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works. 

First off, Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal. The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading (it's only integrated with Dexcomg G6) to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus, just be increased, no change at all, be decreased, or be completely suspended. The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes. Below is the Control IQ tier system.

&amp;#x200B;

 ≥  **180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg/dL within 30 minutes, there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus. The correction bolus is 60% of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg/dL every 60 minutes. This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing.

**160 - 180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **increased**. 

**112.5 - 159 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **not changed**. 

**112.4 - 70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **decreased**. 

 ≤  **70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, basal is **suspended**. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts...

After about 3 days of using Control IQ, my average is higher than what I like. However there are less lows which is awesome. BUT, my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping.  The reason for this is that unlike looping, Control IQ software doesn't not use **carbs on board**. Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten.  This would be fine, if you didn't have to use the CGM reading, but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus, the Tandem pump doesn't remember how many carbs on are board. 

For instance, I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg/dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced  bolus of 0.6 U. I then ""trying to be good"" used the recommendation. I then decided to have an apple, so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams, but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg/dL, the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin, it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg/dL. This isn't super high, but this could have been completely avoided. ALSO, I couldn't stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions, I would have been much higher. It recommended 0U, but I took 0.7U (usually I'm about 1U for an apple). 

&amp;#x200B;

The other feature I'm not crazy about is the tube. I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years, so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D, but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice, especially during workouts. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple features I DO like...

&amp;#x200B;

I like that the software works, all the time. Even if it isn't nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be, I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments. With my closed loop Omnipod system, I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink (device used to connect pod to phone) and phone were connected and working. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also nice not to have to carry an additional device (the rileylink), but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump. So that's not a big change.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the sleep feature. This allows for a tighter range, but doesn't allow for the automated correction bolus. However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg/dL, your basal is increased. With normal settings, basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg/dL or above. 

Oh, and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem, however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I think for the masses, Control IQ could be rather helpful tool. However,  I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me, but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days. 

&amp;#x200B;

TAKEAWAY: Control IQ is less work but doesn't allow the as tight control compared to looping. DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on, but I like the control, and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature.

&amp;#x200B;

*This is just a short snapshot, I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ. I have early access to this because I'm a T1D, CDE, and a RDN. It's a bit of work to review and report, but I hope this information is helpful to you.*",diabetes_t1,1577743438,arielwarren,18,1,True,2019-12-30

Gatorade Zero causes blood sugar to rise,"My brother is type 1 (He's 29 and has had it for 13 years) and I've been trying to educate myself more than just the basics lately to see if I can find some info on how to help stabilize his numbers since they can be pretty erratic.

I'm not sure of his starting number but I know it wasn't that bad or else he would have said something. I would think his number wouldn't really change since it only has 1 carb. Has this ever happened to you with Gatorade zero or with a similar low carb drink/snack? Is there something else other than carbs that can cause a blood sugar spike? Any input is welcome.

 I'll probably be asking more questions if that's ok with the subs rules. I'm trying to learn more to at least try and make my brothers life a little easier cause he's been struggling a lot lately and it's killing me not being able to help.

Social aspects of t1d- and insurance info!,"Hello all! I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer, in my case, my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons, and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue. I also take biologic meds for my illness, and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses, including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer. 

I’ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes, and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes, the illness doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the person’s daily life, and their overall ability to function and work a normal job. 

I’ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories, where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me’s in order to cover the costs of insulin, or having to resort to “Walmart insulin” (that sounds atrocious) when they don’t have insurance, and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance. 

NO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes. Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things, and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d. 

What are your options where you live, in the event that you don’t have health insurance? How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn’t available? 

Some states offer Medicaid, and among the states that offer Medicaid, some offer a program called “Medicaid buyin” where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market. Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid, or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid?

Regarding employment, how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance, as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don’t have to cover health insurance? 

If you do have a job that offers you health insurance, have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance? The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment. I don’t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person’s ability to access a life-sustaining medication, this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor, that’s it. 

I realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive, but are generally able-bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands. This would also include working long hours, as well as overtime. Someone like myself wouldn’t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes. Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized, compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities? My condition wouldn’t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds, but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn’t want to remain in that state for any length of time. 

And, lastly, how does your illness impact things for you socially? Are there social situations, job situations, or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative, judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you? How have strangers reacted? How have friends and/or significant others reacted?

I live in Colorado, where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions. Here are the links for that, as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state. Your state may have a similar buyin program, I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized.

I know what it's like to cry, and to just feel anger, and sadness, and a tidal wave of emotion hit you during a routine diabetic activity, whatever it may be. And I'm trying to say that it's okay. It's okay to hurt. It's okay to be angry, to be sad, to freak out, to cry, to express whatever you might feel. Just remember that you're stronger than this and that you can fight it.

I second guess my correction amounts, I over correct for lows. I turned off alarms cause the two urgent lows I had the anxiety of hearing the alarm and seeing it not improve would cause me to drop again.

But then there are times I actually did need a third juice box. And this was without any recent fast acting doses. Or I continue to spike even two hours after correction and I second guess the dose I did. Surprisingly Christmas was my most steady day at like a constant 200. Which I know isn’t great, decent considering for a holiday, but most other days I’m up and down.

Hard to say what it was before because checking 6-10 times a day didn’t give me nearly enough insight on my readings.

I've demonized all carbs in my mind so Ive narrowed my options to the point that I only regularly eat two things. The snacks(mostly trail mix) slip by that by being low carb in low quantities but I get so caught up that I over do it and knock my numbers out of control almost daily.

If I eat dinner it's pre made meals from the grocery store(HEB) that consist of salmon and broccoli.
And if I eat breakfast it's migas from a cafe near by. 

I want to eat more filling meals to cut out the snacking and constant hunger. So do you guys have meal plans? Meal prep? Go to foods that are easy enough that someone who gets racked by depression daily can prepare?

I'm sad and I'm not doing well. I don't get nearly enough of anything that isnt eggs. To the point that my doctor prescribed me supplements for folic acid and b12. Prescription strength supplements. 
I really wish I could have someone with me who has their shit together so I could learn but it just feels like I'm alone in the world when I paw through the nutrition facts of the entire frozen meal section of the store.",diabetes_t1,1577578873,Atxd1v3,30,2,True,2019-12-28

Extending Dexcom session?,"I've been on Dexcom G6 for over a month now, before that I was using the Freestyle Libre. I heard you could extend the G6 sensor sessions, but I tried two methods and they both failed-

First method was this one [https://theinsulintype.com/2018/12/11/extending-a-dexcom-g6-sensor/](https://theinsulintype.com/2018/12/11/extending-a-dexcom-g6-sensor/) and the app eventually would still tell me that I wasn't allowed to restart and needed to use a new sensor.

Second method was the one here [https://seemycgm.com/2019/08/01/restarting-dexcom-g6-sensors-updated/](https://seemycgm.com/2019/08/01/restarting-dexcom-g6-sensors-updated/) under ""The sure way around ""no restarts"": Bluetooth Unpaired method"" which said I had to start the process over two hours before my sensor was supposed to end, so I did that, and after the 2 hr ""warm up"" it still said the sensor was going to expire at the original time.

Insurance sucks.,"I’m a 14 y/o(15 as of 12/29) got T1D little more than a year ago, so about a month or two into it I got my Deacon G6- worked fine, gave me alerts, always not on point but close enough.

I have a lot of hypos, and my doctor has said it might be good for me to focus on trying to reduce these as my body isn't as quick to bring my blood sugars up as it used to be.

Death Anxiety stemming from Diabetes,"Hey everyone. I'm 24 years old, and I was diagnosed with T1D at 18 months old. I was the youngest person diagnosed in my state until I was 12 or so. Growing up my parents always did everything they could to keep my bloodsugars in check, and when I was more independent as a teen, I hit a little bit of a rough patch with A1C's in the 8's. Since the age of 18, I can't recall having an A1C above 7. In fact, my last few have been in the low 6's and even high 5's. 


With that being said, I like to think I take pretty good care of my diabetes. But I have one constant fear that I cannot shake: the fear of dying. More specifically, that diabetes is going to kill me at a young age. I've dealt with anxiety disorder since age 13, and about a year ago I started medication to help. It has certainly helped, but I still worry constantly- I'm talking probably once or twice every hour I'm awake every day- that diabetes is going to kill me young. 


This has lead to poor health choices. I drink anywhere from 2 to 4 beers nightly just to try to take my mind off it. I used to be a pretty casual drinker, and since I upped my drinking I've gained about 15 lbs. At age 19 I started smoking, which I found sadly helped calm me down and take me out of a panic attack. I smoked cigarettes for about a year, and I've been using an ecigarrette since age 21. 


I constantly worry about my kidneys failing, going blind, losing limbs, heart attacks, you name it, I worry about it. All my life I've heard the horror stories- ""My grandpa lost his legs from diabetes and he died shortly after"", ""My uncle's kidneys failed and he died from diabetes"", all of that really takes a toll. I think I worry about it more also now because I have a beautiful wife and an amazing 17 month old son who is my entire world- I'm always worrying I won't be around to see him grow up. In fact, I'm often grateful we had our son in our early 20s because I often think I won't make it to 40 and he will be an adult by then. 


Has anyone else had this fear of death and complications as a side effect of T1D? What did you do to help your fears? Constantly thinking about death and complications is getting old and it's pretty depressing. Looking for any advice or support I can get.

Healthcare Issues.,"Sorry friends, I'm here to rant. The more I think about it, the more upset I am about it. I was diagnosed T1D 2 years ago, and my diagnosis was horrifying. It started with me going to urgent care for an unrelated problem, and me telling the doctor about the symptoms I was having (all of the symptoms of diabetes unchecked) so she ran an A1C and we discovered my diabetes. She told me that she never had to diagnose anyone with diabetes before, this was her first time. She prescribed me insulin and all of the supplies that I would need and that was it. I wasn't given instruction on how to use the needles, how to do it safe and sterile, how any of it works, how easy it is to take 2 units too much and hypo. Just, hey, you have diabetes, go buy some supplies, good luck. They asked if I wished to speak with a diabetic educator and I said hell yes but they couldn't schedule me in until 2 months down the road (and then asked again to reschedule it another 2 months down the road, just one week before my appointment.) The amount of information they gave me was less than bare minimum. It was frightening and injecting myself for the first time was so nerve wracking.

Thinking about it right now, I'm pretty upset. I've since changed doctors, a few times, over things like them not keeping accurate medical records and prescribing me different sized pen needles (At the time I didn't know it was on amazon for cheaper than pharmacy premium, and I couldn't really afford a new box so I had to suffer it) My current Endo doesn't really seem to care, told me I need to watch a netflix documentary about eating better and that I really should buy the brand name pump that pays him a pretty neat kickback to push their product (literally every visit). I'm out of options, this is the best I'm going to get.

I spend so much money on health care. MOST of my paycheck goes to bills, taxes, healthcare, medicine and medicine supplies. I live pay check to pay check and there's just no way I'll ever be able to afford a CGM/pump at the rate I'm at right now. I'm ALWAYS worried that if I lost my job, I couldn't get the insulin I need to survive.

Broken toes do not require surgery (in most cases). People say to tape 2 toes together to keep it stable, put ice packs on it and keep the foot elevated. Healing process is about 4 weeks.

A rant on Solara med supplies,"  I’ve been with Solara medical supplies for about 2 years now and for the first year they were great! Quick responses, good customer service, and I got all my supplies.  
  This last year whatever prescription they had for my Dexcom ran out and it took a week of calling them and my endo (both saying they were waiting on paperwork from the other) to get it sorted again. 
  Then over the summer they stopped carrying the brand of syringes they had on file for me, so instead of notifying me they just stopped shipping anything. I got a few months of another brand before they ran out of stock of those and just stopped shipping any. I called again and thought it was fixed but they sent pen tips instead of syringes. 
  Now I’m calling every month to check my order because despite each person I talk to saying they’ve removed pen tips from my prescription it’s still what they’ve tried to send. This month I didn’t call in time and the pen tips are on their way. 
  This morning I got a text asking me to contact them. It turns out they were out of stock of whatever syringes they were going to send and I had to describe what kind of syringes I needed so they could send another brand. At least I got a notification this time.

New to fiasp,"Wanted to make a shout out for Fiasp. Recently switched (3 months ago) from NovoRapid and I’m a big fan.  It’s not a massive difference, and the dosing is identical so has been a really easy transition. 

A couple big positives:
- Correcting for highs is much easier, can see it coming down much faster and less likely to stack because of the fast acting
- Eating a low carb meal and dosing during the meal has a zero impact on my sugar, just a flat line
- Don’t eat a lot of carbs so not a good person to ask how high carb meals work out, but can see how that would help when I do have a meal that creeps up in carbs

And some small negatives
- High fat and high protein meals can cause a bit of a dip before digestion kicks in so I’ve started taking my Fiasp right at the end of the meal (more a learning than a negative)
- I’m not a big fan of the pen, for some reason it’s larger than my novorapid pen

Tips for lowering night time highs,"Hey! I’m new to the community as I am just now starting to use Reddit more (my apologies in advance for any formatting issues). Going on 9+ years with T1D, yet I’m still experiencing a problem with night time highs. 

Sometimes I’ll go to sleep at 121 mg/dL and wake up at 212 mg/dL. I typically don’t eat after 9 pm and consume about a couple cups of water before bed.

My A1C’s have historically been high (started in the high 10’s as a preteen and gradually have decreased to 8.2), but I attribute these high A1C’s to the time my glucose is out of target range during the night time.

Service dog advices?,"Hi! First of, I'm 20F, diagnosed with T1D when I was 15. My diabete is pretty equilibrate according to my endo, but I do often have periods during which I very often get either a low blood sugar (under 60 up to about 40 min) or an high blood sugar (from 180 up to 400+). 

Though I am quite conscious of my body and am often able to detect when my glycemia is abnormal, I am not always able to and I already have memory / concentration issues (for psychological troubles) I was told can be aggravated by a variation of glycemia like I may have.

I adopted a dog (female, Border Collie / Aussie mix, from family's friends) about 3 months ago. She is now 5 months old. 

Here's the thing. In my country, service dogs for diabetics are very rare, in fact there's only one association doing it, they train dogs from shelters then deliver them to diabetics. I would love to get one myself but I'm pretty sure I'm not the most in need of them and since I already have a dog of my own I wondered if there was a known way to train her myself. I know a bit about how it works, about that they can smell it but I really don't now how to train her nose to recognize glycemia variations. 

Also, I did contact the association about the same subject and they told me it was a project of them to maybe train some regular dog trainers to train service dogs but nothing's started yet and they will keep me updated but I'm afraid it might take quite long before they start doing it. 

I know my dog may not be able to be trained to it, if, who knows, she has a bad smelling sensitivity for whatever reason, but she is very smart and able to learn a lot so I'd like to give it a try. I also believe she'd enjoy having a ""job"" as Border Collies are known to enjoy so.

Must be a bad vial!,"Christmas Eve, swap out my pen with a new vial before dinner.  Christmas Eve dinner was a super tasty cheese fondue, with a ton of low carb options because my wife is awesome.

Weird, BG on the rise, despite dosing a bit higher than I should have.  Fire up a correction and head up to an early bed.  Woke this morning with a perfect BG, but a chart on my Libre showing a slow steady decline all night.  Santa must have taken care of that high for me!

Nice brunch today, with a tiny bit of carbs and lots of tasty protein, but went high.  No problem, hit a correction, and chalk it up to carbs hidden or maybe bad math.

Dinner at my parents is a carb fest!  Still high when I arrive, so I hit a correction.  And then another.  You know, this must be a bad vial because it barely works.  Another correction, dose for dinner, correct again, and one more before the drive home. I’m still running high, and I can’t wait to swap out this crap vial for a fresh one.

Along with my contour next meters test strips and i am still trying to get a hold of my dr to fill shit. Now mind you i wont lie i waited a lil over a week after getting the 30day supply to call them. Wasnt meaning to but life happened. Yes i know my health is the most important thing. Bht it happened anways so were talking at least 2 wks of trying to contact my damn dr for these scripts. Calling agai Thursday to see what happens. Anyways. I have enough in my last vial for 1 more set change. Heres the question. Has anyone ever taken insulin from an insulin pen and put it into the pump? 

I ask cause i was curious and dinging around and thought what the hell ill see if this is even possible. Well it is. But wasnt sure if this is umm smart? Lol. My insulin pens are still good for a few more months and its the same insulin. I use Admelog if thats important. Just curious. Cause im in a slight pinch here and with the holidays i have no money to get the vials or even test strips. Thankfully i have my old meter with a full bottle of strips.

"It's hard, but every moment is worth celebrating. Even when it's a sh*tty glucose day!","So, as many fellow-diabetics may know, no day is the same. Glucose levels are not logical, they just often do whatever they want which causes sometimes extreme highs, lows, terrible sickness and hospital admits.   
I've experienced a few times a ''diabetes burn-out'' which is awful. But, I did learn some things in that time what helped me to see light at the end of the tunnel. I'm writing some of it down, I really hope others can get something good from it because you deserve it.

\- Don't be angry at yourself if your levels aren't doing what they were supposed to do. You're a badass for working 24/7, and no day is the same. 

\- Every minute that your level is good, is worth celebrating. Last day I only had 1 hour of good levels, but it was a full hour. I wrote it down in my diary, because I did fight for this moment and I deserve to be happy about it.

\- Even when you're feeling sick, don't feel guilty when you can not come out of your house/call off your work/school. It is exhausting to manage an illness 24/7, but look at what you've accomplished already. You woke up, you got out of bed or even brushed your teeth. The most harsh days you've pulled through, and even ''small'' things like putting on clean clothes or brushing your teeth are huge accomplishments when you're feeling that awful.

\- Write down every day at least 3 positive things that happened. It can be a variety of  things; you've seen the sun shine, you maybe have heard some birds sing, maybe even saw one of your favorite friends/family members. The ''small'' things aren't small at all, because they make us enjoy the day a bit more. 

\- Treat yourself! It may be your favorite snack, but when levels are shitty that isn't always a good idea. Try a nice facial mask, lovely hair conditioner, go online shopping and buy a pair of your favorite cute socks. Whatever you do, make sure you appreciate yourself for working so hard, because you deserve the love &amp; kindness from yourself.

Most memorable low blood sugar story?,"There are so many. My god I wouldn’t know where to start. Most of the most memorable ones were from my first few years of diagnosis (diagnosed at 13). I’ve had seizures only to be awakened by multiple paramedics holding me down trying to keep me from hitting them; a time my poor mothers hand shook so bad she couldn’t give me the glucagon shot (so my little bro grabbed it from her and stabbed me in the ass!); and then times of complete embarrassment as sudden low blood sugar left me rambling on incoherently to strangers unaware of my disease.  Sure it sounds like I’m a poorly controlled T1D, but I’m not. It probably doesn’t even sound that bad to other T1Ds! 

Although the list is long, the most memorable is low blood sugar in my 7th grade Spanish class. I suddenly stood up, the teacher asked me what I was doing, I took a few steps forward as I mumbled something to her, and fell flat on my face in front of the whole class. I was in tears from embarrassment but I managed to get to the hallway and my teacher came to help me. She was well aware of my newly diagnosed T1D and her mom was a diabetic so she was an angel.

Help establishing a correction factor / insulin sensitivity when low carb,"Morning Friendly and Helpful Reddit! 

I’ve been doing quite a lot of reading about how to get optimal BS, particularly now the helpful NHS have given me a libre. Came across this very informative article which provides guidance to Freestyle Libre users on how to use the arrows to adjust bolusing. (https://academic.oup.com/jes/article/2/12/1320/5181247) 

Here’s the question. Given that I have always, and intend to continue, eating a fairly low carb diet (normally 50-75g carb a day), I’m struggling to get a sensible value for a correction factor / insulin sensitivity. Honeymoon very much still in operation which I know complicates things but I take very small doses of insulin (6 basal and yesterday 7 rapid). The article online suggests taking 1700/TDI (total daily fast-acting insulin) to establish corrective but this yields a figure of 1 unit to 243 mg/dL (or as us Brits would say 13.5 mmol/L). This is FAR too high. I’m at 5.8 right now and I know if I injected a unit I would go hypo but I wouldn’t drop THAT far. 

It seems to me that this is an inevitable problem with a lower carb diet. I don’t take much rapid insulin because I do not consume very many carbs that need balancing. This in itself doesn’t mean I am insulin sensitive (although I appreciate that I am). I could just go high, wait until there is no insulin in the system and then give myself a unit to determine a correction factor experimentally but it strikes me that this is likely to yield a poor precision if I were to do it again on another day... 

How can we distinguish an individual with a moderate insulin sensitivity and low carb diet from a higher carb diet individual with high insulin sensitivity??

Night time lows help,"Hello, I’m a newly diagnosed “type 1” after a total pancreotectomy. I’m fairly stable during the day, but having trouble with my post-dinner and nighttime sugars. At night, my goal is to stay above 6 mmol (I have a CGM). I am using Tresiba for basil insulin. 10 units caused my blood sugars to rise overnight ( wake up with +15 mmol) so I increased the dose to 12 units, as recommended by my health care team. At 12 units, my blood sugar would drop from 10 mmol before bed to under 6 mmol around 12-2AM and rise back up to 8 mmol by 8AM. I was told to lower my dinner time insulin to go to sleep with higher bg (+10 mmol) and eat a bedtime snack (low GI) to help combat the dip. This tends to work, but I don’t like having to increase my bg above target if I can help it. I then have to start the morning higher than ideal too. 

I tried dropping my dose to 11 units, but still saw a drop from 9 mmol before bed to below 6 mmol. I woke up and ate a banana, which increased my blood sugar to 10 mmol quickly. After this my bg was completely flat until 8AM. 

I take Humalog with dinner at around 6-7PM. I’ve read this should stop working after 4 hours, but could this be impacting my night time lows? Is the only way to combat this is to eat a night time snack?

Any advice/tips for maximizing the Medtronic CGM? I want to throw it across the room.,"Not an exaggeration. Forgive me bc this might be long and I’m new to Reddit but thrilled there is a t1 community.

I’m currently 20, have had t1 for 8 years, and had a tandem for 4 years, a year of which was accompanied by the Dexcom - which was life changing, lowering my A1c to 7, which is unfortunately the lowest it’s been. Then when the warranty expired, I was able to upgrade, but my parents were frustrated by an incident in which the Dexcom was poorly calibrated, mistook a low for a high, and when I had no symptoms I was hospitalized for hypoglycemia. Their worry was understandable, but it meant that they wanted me to get the Medtronic 670g since they had been in the industry of pumps and CGMs longer.

So I hate the new pump for many reasons: it’s not user-friendly like the touchscreen, beautiful Tandem, it has less adjustable settings, a battery, etc. But the sensor is the devil itself. The calibration warnings are terribly annoying, and the accuracy is horrible compared to the Dexcom, having had both. Not to mention I have to replace it before 7 days about 80% of the time, because the sensor “fails” when it’s 100-200 mg/dL off the mark and I try to calibrate. I’ve called but they have no answer for why this happens. I’m hoping I’m missing some ingenious idea for keeping it on track like a really specific site, or something else?

Has anyone had this problem? It’s really annoying because I’m usually higher than it says and that’s not good over long term! (I’m currently an 11%) But I also want to be able to trust the monitor, it was certainly expensive enough. Medtronic was really hyped up but I miss the Dexcom, seems like there’s no comparison.

Hypoglycemia,"*Hypoglycemia*

It brings me down and low.
It gets my body out of its flow.
It wakes me up in a panic state.
Please hypo not now, it's late.
Sometimes it comes when I'm awake.
Sometimes it hits like an earthquake.
Unannounced it knocks on my door.
Oh there it is, the hypo once more.

The craving for sweets is oh so strong.
The hypo also takes it's friends along. 
Sadness, sweaty palms and blurry eyes.
Makes me miss those sugar highs.
I need to treat myself now quick.
If I don't I might fall like a brick.
The aftermath stays after the hypo is gone.
The tightness in my muscles, it feel like stone.

It feels like dying all over again.
I need to breath and count to ten.
This feeling will pass and go away.
I hope this gets better someday.
I want to work and live my life.
But I stay at home like a housewife.
Impaired and beaten I sometimes feel.
I need some yoga and time to heal.",diabetes_t1,1576818452,Nitro-0-glycerin,6,1,True,2019-12-20

Minimed sensor with 640g pump keeping me up at night,"A bit over a week ago I finally got started on my minimed sensors. 2 months prior I had done a 1 week demo which went great. This time however I am facing a pretty big issue. My pump is asking for way more calibrations than the standard 2 to 3 a day. For example: I just calibrated at 00:45 to go to bed, I check when the next calibration will be and it sais at 6:52. 

I have constantly had this problem since starting with the sensor. I can't get one good night sleep because the pump will wake me up at night, and the max snooze length for the alarm is 1 hour?! I now try to do my last calibration so I can get the max amount of sleep before inevitably being woken up. But this is causing me to sometimes calibrate at bad times (when the trend is very up or down)

Bolus timing?,"Hello fellow T1D people, got a pump related question. I’ve been diabetic for about 16 years but just started using the pump for the first time. I’m on the tandem slim and I’m loving it so far, but I’ve noticed that if I eat typical complex carbs (bread, other grains, etc) it seems like I spike really high before it finally starts to come down. It doesn’t usually seem like a dosing issue, as it usually come back into range eventually. But it seems to spike higher in the process than when I did injections. Not sure if that has to do with the loss of background lantus, but I’m wondering if you all have any tips or have noticed that? I’m thinking I need to bolus a lot sooner before I eat (like 15 mins) and hoping that could help? Any tips are appreciated. Thanks!!!",diabetes_t1,1576892026,rire86,11,1,True,2019-12-20
"Very Important Question. If anybody could help with what they know, an answer, I’d greatly appreciate it very much.","Hi, I’m Kaylynn. My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic. He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult. My husband takes 2 different insulin’s 1 of them is long acting Lantus &amp; the other is fast acting Humalog. 
Unfortunately &amp; absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail, he has been they’re since 9-27-19 - presently. We had talked to somebody who works there, who answered questions we had, I had brought up my husband’s diabetes &amp; the difficulties he faces with his diabetes, this woman “assured” me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and “knew what they were doing” They’re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different, when my husband first went in it took 2-3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him, learn about his medical conditions/medications all that stuff. He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are @ 7am he gets both Lantus &amp; Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of, @ 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin’s then the night medications that were approved. Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm. That’s it. 
Okay, now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much, please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I’m saying, is there anything I can try to do about this? Recommendations? I’d very much appreciate it. I’m lost with what I can even do about this. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🙏🏻😔 I know this is really long, please bare with me, I’m new here &amp; trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand. Okay here we go. 
So, this is what started first then so on, so on 
I received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly “he doesn’t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I’m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn’t care. So I got up, got dressed &amp; got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I’ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house. I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call &amp; explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home, &amp; that since you all are administrating his medications to him, calling in refills, etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills. And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail, and we don’t know when or if he’s going to be released. 
I know this is very long so I’m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it’s very important. 
• I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that “contact the pharmacy” because that’s not they’re responsibility. And that whoever basically is his other half, emergency contact, on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications. 
•So what I’ve been dealing with lately is when he calls (not every call) but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left. If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won’t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up &amp; then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine. 
•These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him, that what they were wanting to do would not “help him at all” they forced him to take it and he nearly OD. So then they put him back on his original dose
There’s been so much damn more. This is already long as hell. 
So lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin’s and put him only on Novolog 70/30 and he said no he wouldn’t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him. 
•He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn’t know what he’s talking about having to do with his insulin, but 100% without a doubt think they know what they’re doing!! 
They’re wrong af, changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable. There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20-30units when his sugars to high?!?! That would kill him!!!

"My 18 yearold sister has had 4 DKA type episodes in the last 10 months with one severe one in the ER, what to do from here?","She was diagnosed 10 years ago exactly almost.


In February she was hospitalized after my parents took her to the ER three times and were told she just had a stomach flu and should drink water and get sleep.

She started screaming in pain in the house on day 5 of ""the flu"" and went into a coma, thankfully she woke up the next afternoon and recovered.

This summer her ketones were high while we were on vacation but not high enough to warrant hospitalization so she ate a lot of carbs and took insulin and water and 12h later was fine.

2 months ago it was a severe episode but since she was no longer 17 and now an adult my parents took her to a regular adult hospital rather than the city's children's hospital and the staff was useless and basically said she was fine even after my parents told them about the February event. She didn't pass out or yell in pain and they brought her levels to normal and she was DC'd.

Currently away from home studying for my Master's and my mom called me to tell me she's sick at home again with elevated Ketones (morning was 0.4 then it went up to 0.9 and at last check is at 0.6).

I'm starting to really worry for her and don't want her to die this young.

She went 9 years with no issues so we have no idea what the fuck is going on where this came from.

The very first time it happened I actually thought she was going to die and started sobbing when I saw her hooked up in the ICU.

This can't be good for her brain or organs and afaik she doesn't skip any doses of insulin so my family is at wits end. 

If she died my life and my parents life would be shattered. We have no cousins or anything and all 4 of my grandparents are in their mid 80s so it would ruin my parents for the rest of their lives if this happened and I would never be at peace with my sister dying so early so unecessarily.

Adult hospitals dont' take this shit as seriously as they should.

Anyone have any idea where to go from here?

Thanks for any input at all, I love her too much to just stand by and take faith in what the Drs and Nurses say at this point.

Looking for Feedback from Folks Who Have Switched from Medtronic to Tandem Insulin Pumps,"I am really frustrated with the Medtronic 670g. The variability with hyper and hypos week to week has no rhyme or reason. I keep my settings the same and will have a good two week run and then there is a period of inexplicable high and then inexplicable persistent lows when in theory the pump should be getting better as it correct more data. My doctor just keeps telling me to keep my setting the same which I have stuck to. The sensors also stuck and you still have to do finger pricks and far too often there is a big difference between my finger stick and the numbers on the sensor. I am kind of upset that my doctors pushed Medtronic so heavily as though they were far and away the best. Medtronic has also had a number of defect problems with its transmitters and pumps. 

I like that Tandem now can adjust the basal rate for highs and lows like auto mode is supposed to do for Medtronic. I like that you can get software updates electronically rather than having to get a new pump. I heard the Dexcom sensors are much more reliable, you can leave them in for longer, and the readings are far more accurate. 

Has anyone else switched from Medtronic to Tandem? Did you like the results you got? Is it any different or do you have the same frustrations? Was it difficult to switch to Tandem if your warranty with Medtronic was not up? How much of a pain was your insurance company or did Tandem have an incentive program to switch?

How many carbs do you eat and how much insulin do you take a day?,"Hey guys. Just curious as I went to my endo today for the regular check-up, and I was surprised when she told me she didn't think I take that much insulin.

I'm not sure I got the English terms correct - hope you know what I mean when I say 1 unit of insulin :)

So, I typically eat 100-150 carbs a day - I either eat outmeal or brown rye bread for breakfast, brown rye bread again for lunch, and then some kinda meat, some veggies and a small portion of either potatoes or pasta for dinner. Snacks could be whatever, but I try to limit my carbs intake as carbs=more insulin. I take 28 units of treshiba every night and then rougly 20 units of fiasp to meals or to correct my levels.

Likewise [novolog](https://www.novocare.com/novolog/savings-card.html) also has a program where you can get a years supply of insulin for $25 dollars a bottle. 

**This is in no way condoning what they as companies are doing financially**, but they do have resources for easing the burden on people.

I essentially have something goin  on in there and its now just plain annoying.

T1 for 23 years and control is.......""reasonably"" ok. Hba1c is a bit high but it has come down. Now then, age 33. My question for all fellow male diabetics and partners of male diabetics. Have you difficulty in getting hard/cumming/performing in general? Also, and here's the big one, have you noticed a lack of drive? I have taken Viagara, Sildenefil, Tildenefil, Cialis and all that any of them do is make me red faced and unable to breath in 1 serious case. Blood as we all know travels all over the body and not just into your dick ;). T1 as we all know plays havoc with literally everything we do, even breathing at times. Whilst I am obviously under a set number of symptoms there will I'm sure be others who are suffering this unbelievably annoying side effect of the disease.

Regarding the prostatitis, I have been for sexual health screenings, I've had a cystoscopy which is just plain painful even under general anaesthetic (when you wake up I mean), I have also seen a bowel surgeon (that's someone who looks at your rear end btw, not someone who studies 5 letters of the alphabet). He has said there's nothing wrong with me but if I want, he can perform an endoscopy (camera in the butt). Being in the UK I don't have to pay for such things ofc but I saw that surgeon in June and its now December. I've been told that there are so many people on the waiting list that the moment an urgent request comes through from the GP, everyone is pushed back. I'm currently looking at probably 40 weeks before I'm seen to and there is literally nobody on the non urgent list being seen rn because of the high number of urgent patients. GPs are now told not to write anyone under an urgent heading unless there is suspected bowel cancer involved. The state of the goddamn health service in the UK is unfeckingbelievable but I am glad that it's there.

Investing in Diabetes?,"Maybe an unusual post. 

Are any of you investing in diabetes companies? I figure as T1s, we know a lot of the market forces.

I have been increasingly interested in this. There are only a few companies that make pumps (small market) and CGMs (much bigger market).

I should say I have no stake in this game other than having T1, so I want everyone to succeed haha But I have no stocks.

It seems to me that Dexcom is well poised to succeed in this market for the following reasons, but I would appreciate anyone else's insight:

* Dexcom has the best tech, good aesthetics, and invests a lot in R&amp;D. The only disadvantage is sensor price, which is crazy. But the G7 is supposed to be cheaper, and incredibly [smaller](https://diatribe.org/sites/default/files/images/dexcom-verily-cgm.png). Once the G7 is out, I can't see how anything competes with Dexcom other than on price. 
* Abbott's Libre is a close second with good aesthetics, good app, and medium tech (small size, but the scanning is annoying). Until they have a full CGM system like Dexcom, they will be lagging. Their big advantage is cheap sensors. Maybe Abbott will create a new Libre that pushes updates via bluetooth, but even the Libre 2 (out in Europe) doesn't really do that. It just alerts you if high/low and you still need to scan the sensor. 
* Medtronic's Guardian/Enlite is mediocre and the only people who use it were forced to because of their pump choice. I have never heard of someone using this CGM who isn't on that pump.
* That leaves Eversense, but does anyone really use that? (honest question).

I'm thinking of buying into Dexcom with the intent to hold that investment for 2-3 years. I'm worried that it's currently overvalued, but I don't want to wait too long in case I am wrong.

What do you think is the future of these companies?",diabetes_t1,1576262160,icebiker,6,1,True,2019-12-13

ADHD &amp; PTSD Stress Increasing Blood Sugars?,"I (32/F) have been type 1 for 20 years now. I have struggled with control the entire time, and don't ever recall having an a1c much lower than 7. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and started an extended release medication. My variable (usually running between 5.0mmol/L and upwards of 16 on good days) blood sugars have straightened out virtually overnight with basically no other changes. It's actually to the point where I have to snack multiple times between meals to stay afloat, and I've had to scale my insulin back a couple times already.

The biggest benefit I'm finding from my ADHD meds has been a significant decrease in my overall stress levels. When I brought up the idea (pre-ADHD diagnosis) that stress was making my sugars high to my diabetes doctor, he dismissed me, saying stress and anxiety should not have such a dramatic effect on my sugars.

Tangent here, I've got an appointment coming up to get tested for PTSD as well. I've taken self-defence classes where, when a flashback was triggered, my blood sugars soared into the 20s and would not come down, even with regular, hourly correction doses of insulin. (If that doesn't point to an abnormal stress response, I'm not sure what does.)

So, my question then, is does anyone else have experience managing stress and anxiety disorders alongside t1d? Are my blood sugars unusual, or does everyone spike in the 16 - 20mmol/L range when say, public speaking or taking an exam? What is the best way to manage stressful situations when you have (perhaps) an abnormal or exaggerated stress response? And finally, how do you get your diabetes team to take you seriously when you tell them it's stress causing your blood sugar fluctuations?",diabetes_t1,1576123925,redthefern,2,1,True,2019-12-11

The Benefits of Our Condition,"I’ve been diabetic for literally as long as I can remember (11 months old). This condition has been a huge part of me, yet in so many beneficial ways. Does anyone else feel that they actually have a slight benefit to their existence because of this disease? 

Recently, I’ve come to realize how much this disease has developed my way of thinking, and way of living. I feel that I am able to empathize well with others because of diabetes. The many times I have felt humiliated because of public hypoglycemic episodes, giving shots, or just being a spectacle in my classrooms. It’s something I had to get used to early. Aside from that, I feel like I know MYSELF, so very well. I’m at a comfortable point in my life with this condition, to where I often catch physiological signs of my blood sugar altering without checking my blood sugar (of course I do check to confirm those feelings).  I am very confident that my journey with this disease has allowed me to know myself, and the interactions that I have with the world. Not only that, but I feel that both my physical and emotional awareness is finely tuned to the world I’m in. I understand hastily, my emotions and the source of them in countless scenarios. I have a very solidified sense of self thanks to the hours of my life spent inside my head, plotting different courses of actions to account for my disability.

All of this is the bi-product of getting down and dirty with this disease. I embraced the life choices I would have to make at a very early age, which I feel is the biggest unseen benefit of it all. I have not known a life outside of the rollercoaster of diabetes, but instead my whole subconscious was setting itself up to succeed with it.

Embrace the insanity that sometimes can be this disease. I ask myself all the time what parts of me would not be the same had I never been diagnosed.",diabetes_t1,1576131519,Tragiqon,4,1,True,2019-12-12

Can someone help me,"Basically I’m 15 (16 in a month) and my whole life at my school I struggled with bullying for being skinny I have always hated how I look and now it is my last year of 5 at school and what can I say, it’s sort off like people have matured and I decided even if I’m thin I would not take shit from people anymore and almost got into a fight but it was stopped by a teacher and since then no one has bullied me since.

Right onto the actual relevant topic off diabetes I was diagnosed about 6 months ago now and recently got my second hba1c off 22 (which is 4.5 I think) so all is good so far. However I have had a crush for about 8 months now and I really need to put on weight for her but mainly to just look normal the bullying stoped but now I just want to put on weight for my self I’m 5 foot 10 and 57 kg which is 125lbs so yeah you can sorta imagine that I look disgusting. I have been 57kg for my past 2 diabetes clinic so yeah I’m not putting anymore on.

The thing is when I first came into hospital I Weighed 50kg so when they told me I would put on weight I was buzzing  and thought I finally wouldn’t look like a twig but 7kg later and I look exactly the same I don’t know where that weight even went lmao my arms are still skinny I still have twig legs and just a very thin stomach but I have always had a six pack for some reason I don’t even do much ab workouts at all lmao.

About a year ago before I was diagnosed I tried to put on weight, I got a set off weight plates and had a app called 5 x 5 stronglifts tried to eat as much as I could I had a app to track my calories and had protein shakes and maybe it worked a little I think I put on 1-2kg but that was not worth it at all for the effort I put in.

So now I’m going to try again before school ends, I have 7 months to try and put on some god forsaken weight I don’t even want to be ripped just look normal, so what would your advice be? My plan is for Christmas go all out on weights (I don’t have the self confidence to go the gym yet and I prefer home workouts anyway) should I try and use diabetes to my advantage and give a lot off insulin and eat a lot because I read giving it in big amounts means you put more weight on, should I go all out this time and just eat eat eat and not give up sorry for the long post but please for my sanity give me tips to putting on weight thankyou.",diabetes_t1,1576176137,XxhaighyXx,7,1,True,2019-12-12

How i denied being sick,"I've had type 1 since i was 11 and just joined this sub to tell a little of my story to give and receive advice.

My little Brother also has t1 and i tot the diagnoses just after a couple of months before his. I was always really regulator and live my life like i didnt have diabetis. Because i still went to school and had a regulated life and used a good medicine (I used a mixtard so I injected in the morning and followed a diet till supper) so I never had any difficulties and lived just like a normal person. Drinking having fun and eating what i wanted. I always analyse my behaviour to predict my sugar levels and only needed to use the dreaded orange glucose  pen once. I could always tell what.my sugar was and my doctors where really amazed until I got to over confident and fuxked up.

I had a few bad hypos but nothing a type one isn't used to. Until I started college life and really neglected my sugar levels. When I'm looking back to those years I can recall a lot of nights when i made really dumb mistakes and said hurtful things to my friends because of my sugar levels. I can't take that back and people still judge me for that. Maybe I'm a prick but low or high sugar make it a lot worse. What i want to warn you about is never believe you can live like a normal person can my low sugar tolerance is now so bad that I can still function with a 1.6( still using the old method I know just used to it) and that's really dangerouse. Now I'm starting with a new program to keep my blood sugar a little higher so I will react again when I have a low blood sugar. 

When I started I could notice when I went below 4 and that I really want to get back to that. The keys that I missed when I was in that period where:

- work out it really helps and keeps you in a right state of mind
- have a stable life
- always measure your bloodsugar( I sometimes didn't for weeks)
- don't be ashamed of being sick and thinking people will see you as someone who they'll need to feel sorry for. Be upfront with everyone. I had a lot of situations(especially with girls during intercourse) where I was to ashamed to say I had a low blood sugar 
- never forget your dextrose
- don't forget to have fun and live your life( I know a little contradictory for me) but I met a few who let the diabetes dictate their lives

I am not forgetting to bolus. I am not sick. Not eating anything out of the ordinary and not overeating.

Victoza may cause delayed gastric emptying. I am having symptoms of that—gas, bloating, nausea. Because of food lingering longer than it should, that could be affecting my blood sugar. But wouldn’t the extra insulin correction address that, at least for awhile?

feeling bitter towards type 2 diabetics,"I want to start this post off by saying that diabetes sucks no matter what kind you have, and my heart goes out to every single diabetic out there.

However...

I am tired of being lumped together with type 2s by people who don't know any better. 
I am tired of being told ""at least you can eat what you want"" by type 2s themselves. 
I am tired of hearing ""If you diet and exercise correctly, you will be better! Just look at my (insert type 2 relative/neighbor here) who is no longer diabetic.""
I am tired of type 2s telling me that they know what I go through.
I am tired of hearing that I am lucky that I have type 1.

And I am so incredibly tired of explaining the difference to people when it doesn't even seem to matter. Half the time, I'll start talking about it to someone and I can see their eyes glaze over. No one wants to listen about the intricacies of a medical condition they think they understand because they've heard a couple ""diabeetus"" jokes. Maybe they're just grossed out by the thought of shots and finger pricks, but... still.

Does anyone know what I would give to be able to produce insulin again? Imagine being able to turn this whole thing around. Imagine not having to take an injection ever again. 

Imagine knowing there is an end in sight.

I know that diet/lifestyle is not the only factor in becoming type 2, and I don't think that anyone deserves to have this terrible diagnosis, but I wish  type 1 had a different name so that people would stop making idiotic assumptions.

Sometimes I just tell people I have a failed organ (which I know isn't completely true) when I don't feel like going through the whole speech. 

When will there be a type 1 diabetic character in a popular movie/tv show/book? There are plenty of type 2 characters.

I just hate being grouped together with type 2s all the time, and I wish I could somehow convey to people how much I go through every single day and will continue to go through every single day, regardless of diet and exercise. 

I will never get rid of this disease like others can. What a terrible thought.

Anyway, it feels good to rant and I am so incredibly grateful for this community. People here understand what we go through in a way that even endocrinologists/doctors/nurses/parents/significant others can't. Thanks for reading!",diabetes_t1,1576096424,chocolatedust,170,1,True,2019-12-11
Type 1 Diabetes is like Hungry Hungry Hippos,"Just saw a post about how annoying it is to try and explain type 1 diabetes, and the difference between type 1 and 2. In my experience, you have 60 seconds (max) to explain before they stop listening. I was diagnosed in August and here’s the ELI5 way I’ve been explaining it to people.

Type 1 diabetes is like the children’s game Hungry Hungry Hippos. The white balls are sugar and the hippos are insulin. 

Now in any normal person/HHH game, the player (your body) presses the hippos so they eat the white balls (the sugar you’ve eaten). 

In type 2 diabetes, imagine there’s so many white balls on the board and the hippos have eaten as much as they possibly can. There’s no more room and they stop caring about the white balls. Aka insulin resistance.

HOWEVER, in type 1 diabetes, the player (again, your body) has taken all four hippos from the board and smashed them into pieces until there’s no more hippos (insulin). There’s nothing to eat up the white balls and they simply sit In the ring (your bloodstream). Basically, diabetics are now forced to bring along their own hippos every time they want to play the game.  No diet or exercise regimen will ever change the fact that you must now always BYOH (bring your own hippo). BUT it will make those hippos more effective.

"Told my Dr I was doing Keto, he didn’t like it","Hi guys, I went to my diabetes doctor yesterday. I was kind of excited because I’ve been eating keto for about 6 months now and my blood sugar levels have been great ever since.

When I told him about it, though, he expressed serious concern. He said ketosis leads to ketoacidosis (and diabetic coma).

I said I’d heard about that risk but since my blood sugar levels are fine I wasn’t really worried. I then asked, just to be safe, how high my blood sugar would have to get (and for how long) in order for that to happen and he said ketoacidosis can happen with blood sugar levels as low as 180 (!).

That kind of freaked me out so I got home and ate some fruit to get out of ketosis, but still, I have to say, I have some doubts about what he said.

My doctor is open to talking some more about this but I can’t really tell if the position he’s taken is due to genuine medical concern or rather skepticism regarding new “fads”. 

Furthermore, with my health at stake, is that a gamble I’m willing to take?

On top of that, I've been diagnosed with cataracts and had cataract surgery on both eyes, with me only being 21.

My 11 year old nephew went thru DKA last night and was diagnosed for the first time.,"My sisters 11 year old eats a LOT and drinks everything available in a chug. We always thought it was because he just had no self control and was greedy. So we always got onto him and it caused lot of arguments. But, he suddenly fell ill yesterday and stayed home from school. His temperature was reading about 91 but we thought for sure the thermometer was broken. He was having a hard time breathing and our neighbor is an RN so she brought over a nebulizer. Then she couldn’t find his pulse. So my sister immediately scooped him up because for the first time he told us he couldn’t walk. She took him to our small town ER and they immediately checked his sugar. It wouldn’t read it was so high. They checked his temp, it wouldn’t read it was so low. They did a rectal thermometer, and he was so out of it he didn’t even flinch. He was then flown to a really good hospital 175 miles away. UMC of Lubbock.  They were able to get a read on his sugar and it was 1050. Is blood pH was 6.7. So its Diabetic Keto Acidosis. The doctor thought he was in a coma when he saw the numbers before they met. They put him on an insulin drip. They brought it down to 558 in just a few hours. This morning it was 219 then went back up to 278. There’s no organ damage and he is going to make it out of this just fine. Except now he has to be on insulin and constantly check his blood and diet. He said he’s not scared but his mother is terrified. Nobody in our family has type 1 so we’ve never been around the lifestyle, it’s all going to be so new.

One (probably stupid/dangerous) thing I did that really improved my a1c,"I use a medtronic 670g pump with the guardian 3 sensor and keep it on auto mode as much as possible. For the first year using it I noticed that the sensor consistently read lower than my calibration finger pricks. 

Having a head for numbers, I estimated that (when I was in range, at least) the sensor registered about 20-30 points below what my meter read. Eg: pump sensor will read 123, a finger stick will read 147. 

Then, I started experimenting with the pump’s calibration tolerances. Anyone on this system can tell you that if the pump doesn’t like 2 calibrations in a row, it will force you to start and new sensor. That’s no bueno. But, it WILL consistently accept calibrations up to 20 points above what it currently reads. Eg, pump sensor currently reads 116, I press ‘enter bg,’ program in 126, then press ‘calibrate.’ No error messages. 

This is where the stupid/dangerous comes in. I started ‘calibrating’ exactly 20 above what the sensor currently reads, instead of a finger stick. The only time I properly calibrate now is when I start a new sensor or I feel bad (eg feel low/high when reading normal or reading low/high when I feel fine).

I’m down to 2 finger sticks a week and my a1c has dropped 0.5% in the last 3 months. 

I do not suggest anyone do this, and even Medtronic says not to use sensor readings to make treatment decisions. Those of you out there living with this for a couple decades can decide if this kind of tomfoolery is right for you. Good luck!",diabetes_t1,1576015051,smartmouth314,11,1,True,2019-12-10

My partner got his first CGM!!,"Not sure if this is an interesting post, but I really want to tell someone about this. I'm so happy and relieved. For a lot of the time I knew him, especially before we started dating, he struggled a lot financially, which obviously isn't great for an American diabetic. He was always having to conserve supplies and sometimes would just run out of test strips and not be able to get more.

He's passed out from low blood sugar three times in the past five years, twice while alone, and once had a seizure. I've got anxiety, so every time we were apart and he didn't respond to me for a few hours or answer the phone when I called, I would be convinced that he had passed out alone somewhere, even though it was usually just that he was focused on something or fell asleep. Doesn't help that he bikes 4 miles alone through the woods to get to work.

Over the summer, he passed out alone while I was at work, though he woke back up on his own. I have amazing health insurance, and we were engaged already, so I came home that day and asked him to elope with me. We got married in secret (only my dad and 3 of our friends know) and are still having the wedding later, but now he's on my health insurance, which is REALLY good. It took a few months, but he just got his first CGM last weekend! And he can get sensors for $20/month, and insulin for the same price. I'm so happy to be able to take care of him and give him better health insurance, and relieved that I won't have to be so afraid for him anymore.

Carb-counting advice?,"Backstory- I was diagnosed at age 4, and i am now 19. I saw an endo, dietician, and diabetes educator every 3 months or so from the age of 4-14.

The last time i went to get my A1C checked it was 9.9. It makes sense because the pas 3-4 months specifically i've been more or less not taking my insulin or taking it very late. Part of that was due to a very depressed time i was going through but i've been a lot better but still have very bad times at points, and I cant explain how many times ill get home after a bad day and just eat whatever i want, and just think none of this matters anymore, i just don't care, and i wont take my long term or anything for that meal or just anything at all.  i cant exactly describe it but it happens far too much and thats that caused my A1C to go up to that point. For me thats Very high, when i was first diagnosed i was at 12.4 and it just absolutely kills me to see it go up that high again. Does this happen to anyone else and how do you overcome it. is there any motivational technique that helped you. just for reference im not on a pump but i am on a dexcom. Part of the reasoning for my frustration is because my insurance wont allow a pump untill my blood sugars are under better control witch is so annoying because a pump would help with that so much. Please let me know if youve had trouble with this and how you got over it. Thanks.",diabetes_t1,1575943520,KermitThheFrogg,5,1,True,2019-12-09

Larger amounts of insulin exponentially affecting blood sugar,"It's a weird occurrence that happens on occasion, like tonight, which is why I'm still awake at nearly 1am instead of fast asleep..

Protip for Medtronic pump+CGM users: use the Guardian Sensor 3-sensor and Guardian Link 3-transmitter for increased CGM-accuracy,"If you're like me and are currently on a MedTronic CGM for one reason or another think it's important to know that there are two different ways to setup your CGM for the Medtronic pump+CGM system:   


1) using the newer Guardian Sensor 3-sensor and Guardian Link 3-transmitter, or 2) the older Enlite-sensor and Guardian Link 2-transmitter.  


I have tried both setups and found the Guardian Sensor 3+Guardian Link 3 to be much more accurate in blood sugar readings and work better overall than the older Enlite-sensor+Guardian Link 2-transmitter.  


I tried these combinations with the 640G pump+CGM-system.

I haven't tried the 670G-system so I'm not sure if you have these two different options for transmitter+sensor as well, but if you do (and also if you are on the older models), make sure you get the newer transmitter and sensor - for me the difference in accuracy in between the two was very noticeable, and it'd be easy to not know the difference since MedTronic does not clearly state this information anywhere - I had to dig it myself.",diabetes_t1,1575722057,tyriontargaryen5,3,1,True,2019-12-07

Short-term happiness from eating high-carb foods vs long-term happiness from having less blood sugar level spikes and diabetes complications long-term," 31o, diagnosed 6 months ago.

"An idea for a /r/diabetes_t1 Discord, let's do something different","Hi again,

A while back we discussed the possibility of a Discord for this subreddit or other ways to meet people. I have come up with something that might combine those two ideas into one. At first I wondered: how is this group going to be different from the existing ones? The /r/diabetes_t1 chatroom has 750 members, the /r/diabetes Discord has 1500 members, is there a point in making another Discord that does essentially the same thing? So maybe we should do something different entirely. Having 750 or 1500 people in the chatrooms is great for sharing information and hearing lots of opinions on your problems, but it isn't ideal for a more personal conversation or making friends. Don't get me wrong, it's not impossible but with that many people you are going to see different names every day and having 1000 people look over your shoulder when talking to someone else doesn't make it any more comfortable to talk about your problems.

So how would everyone feel about instead of making a big Discord, which would function like a clone the existing /r/diabetes Discord, to make a series of smaller ones for 6-10 people. They would function as some sort of support groups(but not necessarily be just for people who are really struggling with their diabetes). Here you ca n talk to the others and stay in touch with them for a longer period of time, so you can really make friends. They also would never get so back that you would lose track of who is in the group.

Of course I am not entirely sure if this is something people want, it's definitely not for everyone. Due to the nature of these groups there are some difference with being in a regular Discord as well. First off: the users in the groups really have to participate. If a group consists of 6 people and 4 are lurkers who never say anything then that won't work. And of course the invite to the Discord groups can't just be put online, then they would quickly reach a hundred people again. I am thinking that to apply those interested in joining should just send a brief message with basic information about them self(this wouldn't be a personality test, just a few basics like age, country, diagnosed for how many years, gender and such) to make sure there won't be anyone put in a group where they wouldn't feel comfortable.

I hope my explanation of this idea was clear, if it isn't then feel free to ask questions. And please make sure to leave a comment if you would be interested in this.",diabetes_t1,1575745163,Adamantaimai,7,1,True,2019-12-07

My name is Serena and I was diagnosed with type 1 in September of 2014.  Since then, I've had trouble managing which has lead to a handful of hospitalizations, and after my last visit where I was in DKA I decided it's time I take care of myself.  I've started a YouTube channel where I plan on posting regular updates, if not everyday updates on my journey to health.  There will also be educational videos, diabetic friendly food videos, support videos discussing diabetic burnout/diabetic distress as I call it, offering support and bringing light to a subject that's not normally discussed.  There will also be vlogs when it comes to management, appointments, and my everyday life.  My two main goals of this channel are to anchor in my self care; to take better care of myself everyday, and to be a pillar or support for others who struggle with managing/coping with their disease.

Advice for a bad DKA hospital visit?,"So I'm a type one diabetic and have only been for 2 years now. I understand that my sugars can still sometimes be out of control, but this is some next level BS. Yesterday I went to the ER due to my fear of having a bladder infection, hoping to get treated or be prescribed some antibiotics, however, they decided to admit me because I had mild levels of ketones in my urine. I am almost 20, live alone, have a pet, and go to school. Being in the hospital for long periods of time is just not good for me at all, and the doctors and nurses here are not doing anything to help me and send me home healthy. I have told them multiple times what my insulin to carb ratio is, but they keep just giving me 3 units of insulin NO MATTER WHAT I EAT and then get mad at me when it's still high. After bringing this up to my current nurse on duty, she said that I would have to wait until the next day to even suggest a change to the doctor, AND I am no longer allowed to eat. Great, right? The staff where I am (as I'm typing this) is constantly getting frustrated with me for high sugars, when they are the ones not listening. I feel even more sick now than I did coming here in the first place. They won't let me leave until my sugar is under 200, but that feels impossible considering how dismissive everyone has been towards me. Is there any advice as to what I should do?

2 diabetes-free days in a 17 years of T1D life,"I think anyone with T1D would wish for just one thing. That they become diabetes free. That there diabetes is cured. I hope that day comes in all of our lives soon.

I read some research papers about T1D reversal but it isn't yet FDA approved. It talks about water fasting mimicking diet. With a lot of digging and building an understanding about how my body functions and how diabetes works. I decided to try a all fluid diet for a day and if it works out (obviously had a CGMS helping me) I would stretch it to 3 days.

This fluid diet were just vegetables juices with salts to keep the electrolytes in check. I tried and I had never felt better. With no solid food/carbs going in I had to reduce my insulin intake. Both long and short. I also had ketones strips handy to keep checking my ketone levels becomes you should never have higher glucose and higher ketone levels in your blood.

I was very comfortable with juices for 2 days. So I decided to go on a full fledge water only for the 3rd day. 

That day my blood sugar was very low. Below 50 (because that's the least what my CGMS could show). But I felt fantastic. Very energetic. Brain working FAST. I felt light. And I didn't take a single unit of insulin that day.

Recent LADA diagnosis questions from a middle aged guy,"Hello All,

About 6 weeks ago, I (46 year old male), I received a surprising diagnosis of LADA.  Which if I understand correctly, is basically an adult onset of type 1.

The brief backstory;  for much of the late summer and fall, I was feeling tired, achy, weak, grumpy, and then later, dehydrated with unquenchable thirst.    And first I thought it was an autumn cold or something, but it kept getting worse.  I started to worry that I had Lyme disease or something.   My GP looked me over and took blood, meanwhile booking me a followup with Rheumatology.   But when the blood results started coming back, my glucose was 771.  They told me to go right to the ER.

So now here I am.  I feel a lot better than I did when my glucose was so high.  Apparently, I'm still producing insulin enough that my levels are in an acceptable range via Janumet and cutting sugar and carbs (mostly between 100 and 125).   I've seen my new endocrinologist twice, I've been pricking my fingers a lot, and I've been trying to figure out a new diet.

Thanks for keeping with me (I'm guessing that what I wrote seems like a familiar story to a lot of you), here are my questions...

From what I understand, I'm really very lucky that I'm still producing insulin and that injections aren't necessary yet.  My endocrinologist suggests that if I continue to be lucky, this may last for quite a while, though she didn't want to estimate how long that may be.  Is this the ""honeymoon"" period that I've read about?   And is it true that the better my diet now (and the lower that I'm keeping my glucose), the longer that period may last?  Did any of you have a similar path?

Although I'm feeling much better overall, I can't shake a bit of body fatigue.  I've always been somewhat thin, and have kept up, more or less, with a simple exercise schedule.  But now exercise kind of sucks (although to be fair, my head's not really in to it either).  And although I'm not so desperately crazy thirsty like before, there's still some dehydration even though I'm trying to drink a good amount of water.   Any tips for getting my energy back and feeling as normal as possible?  Does the dehydration feeling go away?

And damnable food.  I've been a vegetarian for my adult life, but I ate rather a lot of bread and fruit before.  And now, I've all but eliminated both.  I'm sick to death of nuts, eggs, cheese, tofu, and fake meat.  Raw vegetables are good, though don't seem as compelling as they should.  Even avocados;  as much as I love them, it just doesn't seem satisfying to eat them without good bread.     (Giving up pasta and rice has so far been OK.)    But overall, food just isn't fun anymore.  It's just a necessary chore, finding the balance of getting enough protein and nutrients from food that is otherwise trying to kill me with its carbs.

So maybe this is just something I have to work out on my own, but any suggestions for a diet that feels more satisfying?  I'd even consider working meat/fish back in, if necessary.

Thank you for all of your help!",diabetes_t1,1575564149,raymondmarble,4,1,True,2019-12-05
Anyone need IV3000/Uni-solve/Skin-Tac Wipes? Trying to give them away.,"Hey there - I tried a posting in /diabetes so I'm posting here too if that's okay.

Alcohol &amp; Blood Sugars,"Evening All, 

So... alcohol and blood sugars. What’s the deal?! I’m a type 1 (31, male) with late on-set diabetes as of about 6 weeks ago. I’m still using finger prick tests, fast acting and basal at super low doses as in a full on honeymoon period. 

Anyway alcohol, observations so far as follows; 
Wine - no effect on BG, little low over night if drunk late or in large quantity 
Beer - massive spike up immediate and fairly long lasting
Cider (hard cider as you Yankee doodles would call it) - also massive upward spike
Spirits (e.g gin and slimline (diet) tonic) absolutely no effect 

I’ve been raised to consider alcohol is “carb”, this clearly isn’t right and my hospital friends (doctors and nurses) tell me the same. What precisely is the route for ethanol in the body if it’s not being converted into glucose?

I didnt mention the meter cause i didnt discover that until I was at work and couldnt call. So since yesterday ive had no sensor on and my meters not connecting.

Cannot get our 7 year old his G6 sensors!,"Hi Reddit,

Long story short, my family recently moved to Seattle and we have new insurance. We had stocked up supplies to last us a couple of months to hold us until we settled in. Well, after our first T1D appointment with our new Endo, we got everything set up and I expected to receive our replenishment of diabetes supplies. My wife and I have been calling Seattle Children's Hospital every day and Solara medical will not release his supplies because they have not received a signed note from Seattle Children's. Before we moved, we went to the Barbra Davis Center in Colorado. They were super fast with getting signed documents to Solara Medical Supply. And we never had a lapse in supplies. Now it has been over a month and Seattle Children's says it will take an additional 3 weeks to sign the papers. This seems outrageous to me. What the heck is going on, I'm so frustrated that they are denying my 7-year-old son access to life-saving medical supplies. Does anyone know what to do or have any advice?

The extent of T1 diabetes on behaviour,"Hi! (I hope this is the right place to post this if not just tell me :))

My younger sister (16) was diagnosed with t1 diabetes at a very young age. Whilst growing up we would have normal sibling fights (I am 2 yrs older) however, she never grew out of having a 'violent' / over the top reaction. My parents would justify this by her having a 'low blood sugar level' leading to these outbursts, however, this felt unfair to me. 

Therefore I would like to ask you how much impact having t1 diabetes has on your behaviour/emotions. I admittedly don't know much about t1 , and everyone says I come down too hard on her when she acts out. Does anyone experience these types of mood swings?

I’ve (F40) been T1 for 29 years, and currently work with 2x Levemir Basel and 3xNovorapid as a bolus. I have a freestyle Libre CHM which I LOVE.

My nurse is pushing me towards a pump, as she feels it will dramatically improve my control. I understand the logic, but I’m psychologically resisting a pump. This is for two reasons - 1. When I was diagnosed in 1990, the pump was the last resort, and seen as a step backwards, and 2. I really hate/am scared of the idea of a permanent attachment.

It sounds shallow, but I’m 40 and single, and the idea of having explain the wires to a new partner, not being able to shower as regularly as I do (often twice a day) and having this thing hanging off me to get pulled out on the tube actually terrifies me.

Strange reaction to stew. Is this normal?,"My wife bought an Instant Pot (an electronic pressure cooker for those that don’t know).

The carrots are light on carbs, and the rest is virtually none. Or at least that’s how my body reacts.

F U T1D. From time I ate breakfast till bedtime sugar ran over 400.,"Endless boluses, even injecting with my own humalog pens to try and lower my sugar. Nothing worked! My body was resisting the insulin. Of course there could be 100 reasons why (fighting sickness, stress, blockage, etc) but none of them were feasible today   

Just one of those unexplainable days   So I just took an ambien to end this day ASAP. That way I can’t manually fuck my sugar up anymore than I already have today. At least when I’m sleeping and in auto mode the pump helps me reach perfect levels without my help.

Had to share a T1 noob mistake with you all,"I've been diagnosed with T1 since March of this year. Around that time, my endo got me a prescription for a Libre, and I started wearing it immediately. After a few months, the irritation under the sensor adhesive got worse, to the point where I couldn't wear it for more than 3-4 days without it falling off from the gushing swell of an allergic reaction.

For a spell, I decided to not wear it and do infrequent checks with a blood meter.

Fast forward to the last month or so, and I've started taking insulin as diet, exercise, and lifestyle weren't enough to keep the islet cell onslaught at bay. Time to give the sensor another shot.

I had heard a few people using Tegaderm, so I bought a roll of it in preparation for the next sensor.

I should mention, I'm a man. That's important, because fairly typically we don't read instructions. We know better. 

So I ask my wife to help out since I want to make sure I get the placement just right to mitigate any possibility that whatever I'm allergic to isn't hitting skin. I take out the roll, cut a piece into a larger-than-the-libre circle, take of the protective film and apply it to my arm.

Soon as it's on, I say to my wife ""this doesn't look right, it's not really sticking..."" but just kinda plow on, since most of it seemed pretty adhered to my skin. Sensor on, scan it, and things seem alright. 

Some of you might already be chuckling.

Fast forward to the next morning. I look down, and sure enough the sensor is barely hanging in there. Upon closer inspection, I see the actual barrier firmly adhered to my arm... then the second layer of protective film (d'oh) flopping around with the sensor attached to it.

Tldr, did not realize there were two layers of protective film on tegaderm, shot sensor through a later of protective film, protective barrier, and then finally skin. I am now resorting to a large self-adhesive wrap bandage to keep the sensor from falling off to see if tegaderm prevents whatever stupid allergic reaction my body seems intent on triggering when I try to prolong it's stupid life by using modern medical technology.

Some days are shit, especially in this long drawn out transition when my BG can make no sense, but for some reason this lovely little failure was a laughing moment.",diabetes_t1,1575180457,mmarcos2,4,1,True,2019-12-01

Significant Decrease in Insulin Sensitivity (Is this normal?),"I have messaged my endo about this and plan to take his suggestions, but I wanted to see if this has happened to anyone else, and any potential causes that you noticed, if so.

My body has been quite insensitive to insulin the past week or so. I don’t know if this is common thing that may happen to diabetics randomly, or if there may be a chance that my insulin has gone bad? I have been storing my pens in the fridge like normal until I begin using a new pen, but I have wondered if my fridge is too cold.

Until recently, I have been doing 1 unit:8g carbs of Humalog and about 20 units of tresiba in the morning, with a correction dose of 1 unit of humalog for every 50 over 150, for any reading over 150. In the past few days I have upped my Tresiba dose to 32 units per day and I have gone through over 180 units of humalog in the past two days (though, my carb consumption hasn't increased that much, despite the thanksgiving holiday—normally I can get a 300u humalog pen to last well over a week). I have been giving up to (and sometimes over) 20 units for a standard meal that has probably 50-80g of carbs, and correction doses over twice what I normally do, and I am even having trouble even causing myself to have a low reading. 

This morning, my glucose reading was over 300 when I woke up, despite it being pretty stable levels (~120 and steady)before bed, and fasting throughout the night and drinking a lot of water. Typically, I have been having good (90-120) to moderately low (60-80) readings in the morning since I have switched from Lantus to Tresiba. Yesterday, I had taken 28 units of tresiba, and today I upped my dose to 32 units after such a high reading, and my body is still very insensitive to insulin and my sugars have been moderately high
throughout the day (low 200's), without much response by a high bolus dose of humalog.

What’s concerning me is that if the insulin I’m using has gone bad, I won’t really know until I try insulin straight from the Pharmacy and it potentially causes severe low glucose levels. But, it seems that a decrease in insulin sensitivity of this magnitude is a bit absurd, at least in my experience as a T1 diabetic for 12 years. This has been so frustrating!

Additional context: I was diagnosed with Central Adrenal Insufficiency in 2010 and was on Predinisone until 2017, when I had my cortisol levels tested again and found out that I no longer have the disease. However, lack of cortisol caused my glucose levels to get dangerously low and induced seizures, while Predisone caused my glucose levels to be absurdly high after my adrenal gland went back to normal. I have not taken Prednisone in over 2 years.",diabetes_t1,1575160535,yung_Pabs,4,1,True,2019-11-30
Never Give Up!! My Story," 

I always enjoyed lifting, especially doing pull ups. On January 8, I reached my peak. I was 180 pounds and was able to do 28 consecutive pull ups. Unfortunately after that I started losing both weight and muscle. Late August I was hospitalized with a DKA and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I spent 4 days at the Intensive Care Unit and was down to 135 pounds. I was so weak that I was barely able to do a pull up. I just turned 22 this September and I have a whole life ahead of myself. I told myself that this was not going to get in the way of things I love to do. I slowly started training and by October 1st I was able to do 5 pull ups. My goal was to reach 15 consecutive pulls up by the end of November (November is National Diabetes Month). Today I weighed at 165 pounds and I was able to reach my goal and I am proud of myself for staying dedicated. Most importantly, my diabetes is under control with my latest A1C being 5.9. I hope everyone on here also reaches their goals despite the obstacles life throws at us along the way.

Tslim's Director of Sales told me they don't want me as a client anymore.,"So 3 days ago I was do for a pump renewal as my 5 years was up. I am a tslim user since November 24, 2014. I have had many pumps that have broken in the past, most diagnosed as a battery failure/malfunction. The broken pumps had nothing to do with anything I did wrong except for one where the screen cracked while I was sleeping.

1 month ago I was contacted by Tandem and they told me I would be getting upgraded when my pump warranty was up in a month. The localbrep Jordyn Dooley was nice and got me all set up with a customer service rep. Both were very enthusiastic about me getting the new pump. During the last 2 weeks I went and got the dexcom G6 in anticipation for my new tslim pump.

So this past Monday I never got the renewal call as promised. Tuesday, no call. Now I am concerned and I called them. They tell me someone will call me back. Today I call them and I got told that they won't be issuing me a new pump and to call my doctor. I asked to speak to a supervisor because the woman on the phone was being very short and rude towards me and I could sense a very bad time in her voice. She refused to get me a supervisor and hung up. I called back and the next customer service rep, Brooke, told me there was no one at all at Tandem for me to talk to. After some back and forth with her she tells me that the Director of Sales will call me on Monday, I ask for his name and she mumbles some profanity then hangs up.

So now I am pretty upset and I call back again. She just keeps picking up and immediately disconnecting, and this happened like 5 or 6 times. I am beginning to have some panic attacks, this is my life and I am not calling about getting like my gutters cleaned here... I go upstairs and ask my wife to call from her phone. The customer service rep, Brooke, immediately answers and is now talking to my wife. She is extremely rude to my wife when she realizes my wife is calling to get some information for me. She gives my wife the name of the Director of Sales, Jim Simpson, but refuses to give any other info on how to contact him. Ultimately she just hangs up on my wife as well. 

5 hours later I actually get a call from Jim Simpson. He tells me I am no longer a good fit for Tandem because I am not a good look for them with all of the broken pumps I have had. I tell him that I don't be live that is very fair as the pumps that have broken were not my fault. I mean it's not like I have done anything to cause the pumps to break, I live a very normal life, although I do have many problems from my 32 years with diabetes; kidney disease, advanced retinopathy, and neuropathy. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, but that is all of the activity I am involved in, so the pumps are not put through any stress. 

What do I do from here? Diabetes is enough of a problem and it has been a lot on my wife and my son, on top of all of the other problems that have come from my diabetes. To be treated like this by a company that is supposed to be doing things to make life better for diabetics is extremely upsetting. I am on Medicare so I don't have many choices. I would switch to Medtronic's closed loop pump, but unfortunately Medicare won't allow me to use the Medtronic cgm, so tandem is really my only choice.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? Maybe the best thing is for my story to go viral so Tandem knows I am not just another number and I am a person, a diabetic with feelings, and a person who doesn't deserve to be treated like they don't matter.

Problems with TSA?,"Tomorrow I’m going to be flying back from visiting relatives for Thanksgiving, and I generally despise flying because of TSA.

My first time going through the airport alone, I had to argue with them for over 10 minutes as they tried to tell me I had to go through the body scanner despite me saying I couldn’t and needed either the metal detector or a pat down.

A little container to make your life 0.01% easier.,"G'day everyone! 

I  designed this simple product to hold insulin vials in my fridge. For years I've had vials rollinin around a fridge drawer. Enough was enough, so I booted up the old 3D printer and printed myself one. Figured I would try and help out by selling some on Etsy.

I think it’s very unfair that we celebrate holidays with carbs,"It’s your birthday? Have a cake. It’s Thanksgiving? Have stuffing, dressing, yams with brown sugar and often marshmallows, sugary cranberry sauce, and some rolls and then cover it all in a gravy made out of more carbs. Christmas? Hey, how about an advent calendar with chocolate for every day of the month, not to mention countless cakes and the classic Christmas cookies and fruitcake. Valentine’s Day? Have a whole box of chocolates.

You know what? I like Arbor Day, I have yet to have a tree put my health in danger or make me feel bad because I’m not eating carbs. Do they know how T1D works? I don’t know, but they never make me feel like an ungrateful house guest for not having a cookie; so maybe they do.

Sorry if this was a rant, but I think you guys will understand. I’m not even doing thanksgiving this year because my blood sugar has been really rollercoaster-y lately and I don’t need the stress of guessing how many carbs are in everything or being pressured to eat things by diabetes-ignorant family. I got a turkey TV dinner. It has 33 grams of carbs. That I can work with.

Lantus doesn't seem to be working today and looking for a reason why,"  

Hello everyone,

Having a bit of a problem here. As the flair says I have been T1D for near 42 years now, unfortunately despite the ""good"" insurance still not a CGM or pump yet (I live in Florida now and what insurance covers is abysmal). I do my 20 units lantus bolus before bed every night and if I need a correction wait 30-60 min and test again and administer short term insulin (I wait because I have very occasionally hit a blood vessel with my lantus and as we all know that leads to some scary lows). Last night I did my bolus (I always check to make sure a tiny bubble is in the syringe to make sure I got insulin and not just air) and went about my business. The shot felt a bit odd going in like but no blood or insulin had dripped out (I do my bolus in my butt and do a dab of TP when finished to make sure nothing came out).

So I waited an hour and checked again I did indeed have some Pizza about 5 hours earlier and did get the famous effect leaving me with a sugar of 245 so I did 2  units (my usual correction) of my short term and went to sleep. I wake up 2.5  hours later and sugar aint budged so do another 2 units. Wake up 2.5 hours after that and only dropped to 207 so I do another 1.5 units and sleep again. Wake up 3 hours after that and I have jumped back up to 235.. So I go back in with 2.5 more units and since I am not working today go back to sleep. Wake up breakfast/brunch and I am still 230 it seems lantus is not working or something is up. I have extended pizza effect before but only very rarely till the morning.  I mean I might be about to come down with something as my kids are sick now but I feel fine. 

I am just trying to figure out why my bolus isn't today I think I read before that lantus can hit a fat deposit and not work so much. Can anyone verify this? And if so is it possible for it to come back and haunt me later or will the crystal melt away regardless over 24ish hours? My urine ketones are fine for now though my tummy does feel a bit off. 

TLDR: Lantus bolus doesnt seem to be working today and pumping myself with short term corrections every 2-3 hours doesn't seem to do anything but keep sugar in the same place. Could I have hit a fat deposit and if so is there a chance it will come back to get me later?

thank you all so much in advance",diabetes_t1,1574879553,Bostonterrierpug,1,1,True,2019-11-27

Help paying for insulin.,"Hello, I'm writing this post to hopefully gain some insight into possible programs available to help pay for my wife's insulin. Our situation is this. We live in Ohio. She is 26 years old, she was diagnosed with type 1 juvenile diabetes when she was 15 years old. She has an insulin pump and he a1c is usually around 7, we have a 5 year old daughter that was diagnosed with PHACE syndrome at 2 months old, while that is pretty much cured, we still take her to neurology because of the veins in her head. We are currently paying off a $10,000 bill because the hospital that did her MRI's refused to give us a reference to the hospital that actually takes my insurance.

All that aside, we used to only have to pay $15 or so for her Admelog (used to be Humalog, but it wasn't being covered as much), as we had secondary insurance through a helpful secondary insurance called caresource. Unfortunately they deemed that I make too much money for us to still receive help through them. Now between the insulin costing $120 for 3 vials and $40 for a bottle of test strips, plus the $118 a month we are paying on our daughters debt to the hospital. Were not sure how we are going to afford all of this.

I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and hope you can give some advice or know of some services that could help with our situation. We are much more well-off than many so I am not looking for charity in any way.",diabetes_t1,1574893252,sloppyhopper,39,1,True,2019-11-27

Insurance Question,"Hey everyone, American here living in NY state. Recently have been having all types of problems with my insurance and since turning 26 and losing my family plan I've had to devote a huge amount of time and energy to getting simple things like Novalog and lately sensor transmitters. Most recently I had United Healthcare, which without getting into it was very bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any NY state residents  or former residents on this sub that can recommend a 3rd party insurance provider that's available through medicaid? I'm not even really sure how to research this on my own since googling doesn't work and this is a first for me. Any insight/tips would be welcome and I have pretty much no criteria other than medicaid eligibility and minimal competency. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: Specifically, I've run out of sensor transmitters and reached out to my endo/medicaid/medtronic and as always everyone understands but nobody can help. My old family insurance is still listed even though I haven't received benefits since last year preventing me from getting new orders from medtronic via medicaid until my the termination letter gets through in ""7-10"" business days even though my Medtronic order is over a month behind and I'm without transmitters.

You all know the A1C is a total scam right?,"I was originally writing this as a comment for another post but I got too way many thoughts on this so I just had to make this it’s own thread.....

Can I just take this as an opportunity to point out that the perception that the A1C metric of average glucose control is good? It’s not. It’s total bullshit. It’s laughable and anytime an endo excitedly pats me on the back for having a good one it immediately makes me want to look for a new endo. Which I’ve done a lot. 

Test your endo, if this metric is their only quantitative assessment of your behaviors as a diabetic then you have a shitty endo. I have met a lot of shitty endos so it’s a trigger with many indicators that I’m very sensitive too. 

An A1C purportedly gives you a metric correlative to your long term glucose average over the past several weeks. My A1C is always amazing. Like weirdly so. But it’s not because I’m a great T1. It’s because I’m a really bad one lol. Or maybe a really good one with bad days? Or a great one? I’m not sure and that’s the point. An A1C is incapable of distinguishing whether anyone is good or bad. 

My glucose control has two main modes of behavior on any given day. First is just very flat all day between 120-160. So pretty much perfect. A mode that would lend itself to a great A1C in the end. I drink a lot of water, run, and am very strategic about the carb quality more than the count of the carb for any given meal on these days (fast carbs = bad). A philosophy that’s never taught but yields way better control than anything an endo or diabetic educator could show you. I always assumed this good/bad carb thing is an intuition all T1s get several years into having it. 

The second mode of glucose behavior is a day I’m active and wanting tons and tons of short acting sugary things (ice cream, cake, chocolate) combined with TONS of caffeine. These are my ‘I’m young and strong and can do tf I want days’ where I’m generally in a great mood and not giving any fucks. Not a great example of health in any light but we gotta love ourselves. Sometimes that means being self indulgent. To my point though, on these days my sugar is a harmonic set of fast moving roller coaster waves. Huge and quick glucose spikes in the high 200 to low 300 range (because it’s short acting carbs) followed by insulin over compensating followed by huge and very fast / sudden drops into lows below 50/60 (again, short acting carbs). The insulin over compensating is an intentional part of the scam too by the way. I over compensate means I get to eat more junk food in the end....As you can surmise, I should not be proud of these days. 

But type-1 diabetics have very cool cheat codes in normal life the normie’s don’t get such as 

-huge control over our energy levels in any state of activity (marathon runners unite! set your basal to zero and cruise by everyone else 😎), 

-or our own ghetto version of Aderall (lows keep you spritely and very awake at 4am), 

-or ‘food entitlement’ so you don’t have to share your freakin’ fries. The ‘can’t share I took insulin for that sorry’ has never failed. 

I will very ashamedly exploit all of these on occasion. I will say it now, I know this paragraph will trigger people and totally agree 99% of this is horrible advice. But most of you would be lying if you said you’ve never done any of these. 

Here’s the kicker though, if an A1C is a long term average of the past several weeks what do days of repeated huge spikes and repeated huge lows average out too? Well, a spike of 260 and a low of 40 average out to 150.....a number that would if by itself be represented with a great A1C. In an aforementioned ‘roller coaster day’ this whole day would then theoretically yield an awesome A1C. 

Ultimately, if these are the two main modes of glucose behavior I have then my A1C is always awesome. Tons of highs mixed with tons of lows gives you the same A1C as a perfectly flat line at 150.",diabetes_t1,1574895780,TheGayestGaymer,9,1,True,2019-11-27

Diabetes and Eating Disorders,"Hi all!

Sorry in advance for the long post, but I need your advice. 

I [F20] have had T1D since I was 5. My ""eating"" issues started when I was about to hit adolescence; my sugars became out-of-wack from overeating (endocrin told me to start eating healthier), which led to me developing an eating disorder.

 I was diagnosed with with anorexia (restricting subtype) when I was 12 and cycled between being very underweight/borderline underweight until age 16. However, I soon developed a binge-eating disorder after hitting a relatively healthy weight (menstruation, good vitals, bloodwork, etc.). I don't know what triggeres my BED, but I would consume thousands upon thousands of calories and inject myself with large amounts of insulin to compensate. I have been on the insulin pump since 14ish, so the whole needle situaiton is a mess/probably dangerous. Anyways, this BED led to me becoming borderline overweight, having high blood pressure, cholesterol, and high triglycerides. I suspect doctors never said anything because of my past medical history. This has continued on for years to the point that my insulin settings are still the same as when I was in my mid-teens. While my A1C levels are good (7.0-8.0), I know for certain that my basal/carb ratios on my pump are wrong because I inject myself with more insulin to compensate. I don't think I've had a ""true"" A1C reading since before the BED started and sense that I have developed insulin resistance. When I stop binging, incorporate moderate exercise, and actually have my BGs under control with my current settings, I drop weight and lower the BP, cholesterol, etc., but doctors evidently freak out, presumably because of my medical history. I have never purposefully restricted my insulin, so I don't believe diabulimia would be in the mix.

Hence, the question remains: how do I come clean to my doctors about this and/or suggest gradual pump setting increases to get to the dosages I need to be at? My settings have been virtually the same since age 15, which you would think would raise red flags? Would they accuse me of diabulimia for losing weight despite having always done the opposite of restricting my insulin? I have lost weight in recent months from being more active and no longer binging (~12lbs), but still struggle with the occassional extra insulin injections. I fear that doctors think that my ""overweight"" weight is my set point, despite me having constantly binged/overeaten/injecting who know's how much insulin to maintain that weight. As I've mentioned, the periods when I stop binging leads to weight loss (even when not exercising). I worry that they would see this as grounds for hospitalization, readmitting me into ED treatment, taking away my insulin pump, quitting college/work etc.

Again, excuse the uneducated/stupid nature of this post. I just feel extremely stuck and need advice.

TLDR: T1D since age 5, anorexia from 12-16; binge-eating disorder 16-now led to improper diabetes care (injecting extra insulin via injection despite being on insulin pump, high BP, weight, etc.). Still with same insulin settings from mid-teens. Want out of this cycle, but am worried will be accused of relapse/diabulimia.",diabetes_t1,1574740953,squashingpotato,2,1,True,2019-11-25

Scary stories of low blood sugar.,"Unfortunately, we all have them. What’s yours? Mine just happened over the weekend. 

Went camping over the weekend. Medtronic 670g and guardian sensor. Late at night around 10 my blood sugar dropped to 60. Had two pop-tarts because I felt it dropping hard. Blood sugar continued to drop into low 40s. Drank a Gatorade to wash down those pop-tarts. 5 minutes late beeping “below 40” and checked it to be 35. I downed another couple pop tarts, some Oreos, and a juice. Long story short, for about four hours into the miserably cold night camping, my sugar hovered between the 30s and 40s, taking about 4 hours to get above 50. I had a full box of pop tarts and several juice boxes. Waking up around 1:30ish, in freezing temps, I noticed the pink basal dots were still going, giving me basal. I took off my pump, thinking it was going to kill me, woke up two hours later, sugars over 450. It took almost all day to bring back to a healthy number. The cold made it significantly more miserable. Being away from any cellular service to call for help, and feeling like I might die was intense. 

This pump was a *certified replacement* I got about 10 days before. Malfunctioned, delivered basal in the 40s and overdelivered insulin. They just overnighted a brand new unit today.",diabetes_t1,1574802383,Reckless-Bound,19,1,True,2019-11-26

America has the WORST health coverage for humans 1/10,"Why is it that in America it’s cheaper to buy testosterone or estrogen for changing sex or in some cases given for free (not something medically necessary) than getting a supply of insulin? (Required to live) 
According to personal and online sources insulin costs at a high are around 6$ a vile to make for analog. Yet people pay up to 200$  or even 500$ for a vile after coverage, that’s a fucking disgusting mark up. This causes kids and adults to ration their insulin because they can’t afford it. Something they die from. We need to change our system from money hungry thieves to companies and distributors that care about human lives. Setting a cap on insulin costs to 100 for a month supply is a good start but it’s not enough. I’m not diabetic but my gf is type 1 and I was reading into this topic on my own.

My Low-Carb (Dr. Bernstein) Experience,"I'll start off saying I think Dr. B is fabulous.  I know his strategies are a matter of controversy -- I'll just say how they have affected me.

I've had Type 1 for 48 years now.  I've done Bernstein low-carb on and off over the years -- hey, I'm human and have fallen off the wagon for years at a time, usually during stress-filled life periods.  But I've done the Bernstein thing over many periods in my life, and I give him some credit for my lack of diabetic side effects.  My GFR is 93 (good kidney score).  No diabetic retinopathy per my opthalmologist.

After WAY falling off the wagon during a multiple-year period of family stress (leading to high A1C and big weight gain), I decided this spring it's time to get myself right again.  Since I started back on eating the low-carb Bernstein way, my A1C went from 8.4 to 5.2.  Sheesh, I got a congratulatory high five from my doctor (shocker).   My feet have vastly improved, from crusty and bone-dry to nearly normal and supple.  (I know it's TMI, but you guys know what I mean.)  

Side benefit:  I lost 73 pounds.  Now 118 pounds (I'm 5'3"" woman).  66 years old.

Insulin dosage:  Then - approx. 56 per day.  Now - approx. 8 per day.  Basal Tresiba:  Then - 26 per day.  Now - 6 per day.

Now, during those years of eating whatever, whenever, my daily BGs were floating anywhere from 150-300.  Having those HUGE hypo episodes from taking big doses of fast-acting insulin to correct the highs.  Then I feel like crap.  Worst I think is the underlying fear re the big hypos and the ""what the hell are the 300 BGs doing to me?""

Typical day now:  Wake at 5:30 a.m.  BG is below 100.  Immediately take fast-acting insulin to counteract dawn phenomenon.  Since meals are low-carb, I can take very small amounts of fast-acting to cover -- usually 2.5 units or less.  If BG high post-meal -- I'm talking 115, 125 -- half-unit or one unit brings it down below 100.  And then when I see my BG trending down below 70 on my CGM, I take one or two quarter-tabs of a glucose tab to bring it back up.  I cut my glucose tab in fourths so I can take just the right amount of correcting glucose.

My BG has not been above 150 (and a high BG like that is a VERY rare occurrence) for the last 8 months.  It really changes your perspective.

So instead of the HIGH and LOW roller coaster, you'll have much, much gentler ""trends"" that can be easily corrected.   The low-carb Bernstein way levels you out.  I think he says something like:  Small inputs lead to small mistakes.

Yeah, on Bernstein you don't get to eat cake, cookies, bread, potatoes.  I don't crave them anymore.  And what the living heck have those lovely carbs done for me, my life, my body?  They are nothing but trouble ... addicting trouble.

Weight loss in newly diagnosed T1,"Hi all! It’s my first post on here!

I was diagnosed with T1 in April of 2019 (31F). I noticed I was losing a lot of weight (like maybe 15 pounds) prior to my diagnosis. 

I’m on MDI because I can’t get access to a pump until I’ve been on insulin for a year, so I have 5 months to go - woohoo!

When diagnosed, I weighed approximately 200 pounds. I worked with my educators at my local hospital, including a dietitian. I’ve limited my carb intake to about 60g of net carb per meal (some meals are lower). I’ve cut out most added sugar and I tend to limit high-fat meals. My weight is currently down to 165 pounds.

My glucose levels have been improving; my A1C was 7.8% (down from 11% in April). 

My question is: has anyone else experienced weight loss post-diagnosis? My activity has remained the same - I’m not one for intense exercise. Any thoughts? It’s starting to freak me out.",diabetes_t1,1574726804,sadstatue27,4,1,True,2019-11-25

Losing weight and trying to get in shape again while playing on the balance beam of type 1,"So as a preface I was diagnosed with type 1 in 2015 at the age of 28. I didn't have much of a clue about what the heck I really needed to do. It was hell trying to figure things out for quite awhile going from high to low and being miserable. With not much help from any of the doctors I saw or nutritionists... I finally learned for the most part how my body reacts to different foods but was stubborn to give up what was making me miserable after eating. 

February of 2019 I got up to 190 pounds. Most I've ever weighed. For the longest time before my diagnoses I was 155lbs. I decided I needed to do something about it. 

I work at a high school doing maintenance, they have a decent gym in it and I had been doing some exercising but not a whole lot. Once I finally resolved myself to lose weight and get in shape again I really (or at least felt like) I went at it. I also started using a calorie counting app and was for a time doing intermittent fasting 8/16. It's definitely true, the first 10 pounds, once you lose that you hit a wall for a bit but once you break through that it's not so bad. I do 20 minutes of weight lifting, varying 3 different exercises Monday through Friday and then do core and finally 10 minutes on a bike for cardio. 

I have for breakfast a 50/50 mix of bolthouse farms ""green goodness"" and ""blue goodness"" which is about 40g carbs and 145 calories (3 units of insulin when my bg is around ~100). Once I finish working out I have a protein shake which is 30g of protein in milk which is about 20g of carbs and about 200 calories or so and no insulin to account for the coming bg drop. Then go about my work day. I try to limit any snacks I have/need to a minimum. For lunch I have a meal replacement from huel mixed with milk which is about 80g of carbs and 30g of protein and it's about 800 calories. Once I get home from work around 3pm or so I'll have a salad which is about 60g of carbs and 600 calories. Sunday night through Thursday night I take 10 units of my long acting insulin. Friday and Saturday night I really 20 units if I'm not doing anything physically demanding. 

Since February I've gotten back down to ~162lbs which varies but I'm still working at getting back in shape. I do occasionally break from this routine and I'm sure there are probably better things I can eat instead but this is the easiest for me. I also take a number of different supplements (which I know everyone reacts differently but), I take a probiotic, bcaa, multivitamins, zinc (mainly for the immune system boost), fish oil and B12.

If there's anyone else in our sub who's also trying to get in shape or is in shape and maintaining I'd love to hear what you do as well.",diabetes_t1,1574615018,armorize,5,1,True,2019-11-24

In the process of starting with a new one but dont see him till January 14. And my regualr dr who used to do all my scripts for me has yet to respond back. I know he cant do the pump stuff not asking that. Just need a script for the vials. Well no reply. So now im gonna have to switch back to injections till January and its got me nervous. I havent been on the pump long but man has it helped minus some issues but im only 3-4 months into so i know theres a lot to learn and adjustments whcih is why i havent given up. But im gonna have to just not use my pump for almost 2 months and it has me anxious. Im gonna keep my CGM in and the pump on me without insulin and not attached to me (obviously) because i sometimes cant feel my lows and i work at a job where im always movi g around so i want to at least be aware of my highs/lows. And buying the insulin vials out of pocket is not an option for me. I just gave up my kickboxing classes cause those were $80 a month and i couldnt even make half the payment right now. Insulin costs way more. Thankful my insurance covers i am. But i cant do anything without a script.  Fml. Sorry yall just venting. Im ready to scream honestly. Just need some positive vibes and encouragement that i can switch back with minimal issues. Lol,diabetes_t1,1574549465,Sparkplug2019,10,1,True,2019-11-23

Dexcom g6 app UK,"Hi all, I promise I have searched but to no avail. Is there any alternative to the Dexcom app for G6 as I find it beyond awful.

I mean so much data generated but there is less than nothing you can do with it. Clarity is not much better. I just do not get why it is so awful with no options to customise.. I use the UK version so maybe the US is better but is there anything I can do or any alternatives I can use?

Should I wake my T1 fiancé up if he falls asleep without taking insulin?,"My fiancé’s (27M) hadT1 for 3 years now and self injects instead of having a monitor. Sometimes he’s really tired from work and will fall asleep early and I never know if I should wake him up or not if he hasn’t taken his night time insulin.

Tonight he fell asleep around 5 and his blood sugar was 91 which I know is pretty decent, but he ate a pretty carb heavy lunch around 2. He actually at one point assumed he was going to be really high, but he wasn’t so he didn’t take any insulin and figured a nap might make him feel better. 

He’s been asleep now for around 3 hours and I worry he’s going to sleep through the night. Should I just let him sleep or should I wake him up?

Scared of going blind + tips on getting back on track managing diabetes,"Hey guys, guess I'm just looking for someone telling me going blind is very unlikely. I hope.

I've been T1 since I was 7, but it's a.. clinic type 1. My native language isn't English, so I apologize for any mistakes or if I make myself unclear(I'm Danish). I got 95% of my pancreas removed as a newborn, as I produced way too much insulin. Worked pretty fine without insulin, but still testing glucose levels everyday, till I was 7 and was diagnosed with T1. I'm a 25, almost 26, year old woman now.

Anyways. Here in Denmark we get pictures taken of our eyes quite often to see if there's any changes, and if there is, to catch it before it's too late since we can get laser treatments if it's bad. Last year I had some minor changes in my eyes, which I know is quite common after  15-20 years with diabetes, but I cant seem to find much information. What I can find is 1) controlling your glocuse levels decrease the risk of complications(of course) and 2) high blood pressure increases your risks of complications. I get my blood pressure tested every 3 months and they've always been normal. I wonder if someone has any (calming) information about diabetes and eye complications? I'm terrified of going blind.

I've been feeling quite unmotivated the last couple of months about managing my diabetes. It most likely has to do with me being stressed(my mother passed away due to Alzheimers this summer and I've been making some career choices). I find it SO difficult to get back into a good routine taking insulin consistently before every meal etc.. Does anyone have some tips from a diabetic to a diabetic on this subject?

Looking for some advice for my daughter,"My daughter was diagnosed with t1d 3 months ago today.  She just turned 5 and was 4 at dx.  She takes Humalog Jr. and her basal is Tresiba she also has a Dexcom G6  It has been a struggle.  I'm trying to follow all the guidelines I was given in the hospital, but I'm also trying to figure out some things on my own.  I'm really looking for some good advice or academic resources because I want to understand specifically how the body is working.  I don't feel like her treatment team is answering my questions, they sort of ignore my concerns and tell me to change her carb ratios.  Sorry for the super long post and at least one crazy question.

1. How can I estimate or calculate the absorption of carbs into the bloodstream?  For example, I was taught if my daughter is below 80 to give 15g carbs and check again 15 minutes later.  That seems to spike her way up into the 300's and she won't come down even with a correction dose.  If I look at it from a purely numbers perspective, I see it as pouring 15000mg carbs into about 14dL of blood.  Giving me 1071mg/dL, which obviously isn't the case because she only spikes to the upper 300s.  However, I would like to be able to estimate how many carbs are going to end up in the blood stream so I can more accurately gauge what treating a low should look like.  I'm also just interested in the biological process.  I know this will be different for different foods, but when I treat a low I always end up giving her a high.
2. Related to number one, I'd like to know more about the process of digestion and absorption of carbs into the body and how long the process from eating to eliminating takes.  I've gotten my daughters pre-bolus down pretty well.  Her turn happens between 20-24 minutes post injection, a 10 minute pre-bolus will yield a relatively flat line, any longer and she'll go hypo before dinner can kick in, any shorter and she starts going high and it's like her body ignores the insulin.  Here is the issue, I can almost set my watch to when her Humalog loses effectiveness, appx 2 hours post meal she steadily goes up until she levels off in the 240-260 range.
3. She has been having really weird and unexplained lows, usually at night.  Can anyone tell me what causes these?  Three nights in a row, hours after dinner, so presumably her fast acting really isn't active anyone, she will drop dangerously low.  She eventually dropped down to 46 last night (41 on dex; 46 on finger stick).  When I gave her a juice box she was 71 on finger stick, 15 minutes later she was 46.  So I gave her another juice box and some fruit gummies, because I was terrified.  This sent her to 400 over the course of 2-3 hours.  I don't understand how she can crash so hard without being given insulin.
4. Lastly, I can't seem to find an answer on this one.  Does a t1d need carbs and insulin at every meal?  Sometimes my daughter just wants eggs and bacon or a plain hot dog cut up, but I make her have toast or fries because she needs her insulin.  Is this a valid thought process?  Basically everyone I've asked says ""that's a question for the doctor"", which sucks because we only see the nurses and NP right now.  I don't get to take her to see the doctor until the end of December.  I am not in any way trying to avoid carbs, I understand the important role carbs play in the body, I'm just not sure if a carb free meal here and there should be avoided.  It would be nice if I had a chart that said ""A 5 y/o girl who is active a lot needs 60 carbs per day"".",diabetes_t1,1574317718,hereformydaughter,4,1,True,2019-11-21

My 3 year old son is showing signs of remission. Very confused,"Hi all. First of all this is my first post here so I'd just like to say thank you. I've been reading so many posts from you all over the past 8 weeks. It's been helpful and insightful so thank you.

I'll give you a little background to start with. 

My 3 year old son was diagnosed with T1D about 8 weeks ago. We'd taken him to the Doctor due to a lack of any real appetite and lots of trips to the toilet for a wee. They did a quick urine test and found sugar. So onto the finger prick test and they found his blood sugar at 23 and sent us straight to hospital to get started with Insulin. Just like that my son was a diabetic. I'm sure you all know how the story goes....

Since then we've been dosing him with 2.0U of Levamir every morning. And an insulin to carb ratio that has dropped considerably over this last 8 week period. We started with a 1U insulin to 15g of carbs. That was steadily increased and was sat at 1U to 35gc over the past 4 weeks. Im happy to go into more detail on the numbers if required anyway but I'll leave it at that for now. 

Last Wednesday, he started being sick uncontrollably, as if he'd picked up a stomach bug. This carried on for around an hour while we attempted to keep his blood sugars up through any means necessary. He ended up going to hospital with a blood sugar of 2.7 by the time we go there. Straight on a drip over the next 24 hours due to this severe hypo which we thought was brought on by his sickness. The more we have thought about it though, why would he drop so low so quickly? We were a little confused. 

We got him home on the Thursday night and everything seemed to be getting back to normal but on the Sunday night he took another downward turn and started being sick again. Another bad hypo and a call for an ambulance. They ended up giving him a glocogen injection to increase his bloods enough to temporarily make him alert again. Again we wondered why he'd dropped so severely. Was his food just sitting in his stomach so the insulin was then just causing the hypo? On top of the sickness as well. 

The next part of all of this is where it gets really weird. We've brought him home yesterday after 4 days in the hospital where he'd been back on the drip and managed to start eating enough for them to let him out. Since Sunday night though, we haven't given him Insulin at all. We've only given him 1.5u of Levamir which has now been dropped to 1.0u. His bloods have not been outside of a normal range since Sunday night when he had the last hypo. How is that happening? 

My mind is doing overtime trying to work out what the hell is going on with my sons body. So many questions. Is he cured? Was he ever diabetic? Will it come back? Did he throw up his diabetes? Was it something else like a kidney infection and the diagnosis was completely wrong but the hospital stay has accidentally helped him cure whatever it is that was actually wrong with him? 

I'm over the moon my boy is back at home. But I'm a little Confused at the moment. If any of you lovely lovely people can help me and my family out with some experiences or advice then we'd be so grateful you've no idea. 

Thank you for taking the time to read. These words are just a literal brain dump so apologies if some of it is confusing. I'll happily answer any questions :)",diabetes_t1,1574352374,boingaline,11,1,True,2019-11-21

Currently 3am and im up because diabetes has decide “f**k you today” -.-,Sorry for the long post. Im exhausted and frustrated. Prolly a lot of typos too. Just needed to vent. So i did my site chan today all went well. I ate dinner at bout 630-7. I measured out the correct portions carb counted etc. 2 hours post meal im 250 and rising. Wtf bro. Ok fine. I check the tubing the resevoir all seems fine. I contact my dr she says take a small manaual injection gave me a dose to take and keep an eye on it. I do just that. Bout 2-3 hrs later im plummeting. Ok cool so from one extreme to the next. I contact my dr again and explain the situation she said the pump might have had a kink so detach it since it had active insulin in it. But make sure i reattach it when im stable again.Mind you its now 11pm. Fine. I correct it and i know i slightly over corrected but i did the usual panic its 48 and dropping. So i knew id spike a little. But i waited the time frame a little longer actually i was 137. But then i retested after another 30mins to see i spiked. Which i was right i did went to 186. I enter the correction into the pump. Wait to see what happens. 12am im now 270 and rising 3 arrows pointing up. What in the actual fuck is happening. I look down my stupid ass didnt re-connect the pump 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️. So i reattach it then add in the units i just missed. 130am pump says 311 and rising. At this point im ready to cry and punch something.

Any Fitness Experts Out There on Type 1's?,"At the end of August, I decided I was tired of my ""beer belly"" and being unfit and decided to change things.

I've never smoked and I've cut out all alcohol since then.

I exercise almost every day now.  I do 20 minutes on the elliptical, and my heart rate is elevated the entire time.  I follow it with a mixture of planking, bicycle kicks, lower leg lifts, push-ups, and chair dips, adding up to 30-40 minutes of exercise.  Some days I'll do some light weight lifting instead.  I'll stretch after that, have some water, get cleaned up, then take the dog for a walk.  I do this while fasting.

After work, I'll do a slightly more strenuous lifting regime.  I'll eat dinner afterwards.

Since I started, I have not increased my caloric intake.  I also eat a low-carb diet.

I've lost zero weight during this time, but I have gained muscle definition in arms, legs, shoulders, chest, and lost a whole belt size.  I call this moving my weight from the bottom shelf to the top shelf.

However, I still have a bit of a gut and no core definition.  I am aware that it's been a little less than three months.  But am I expecting too much too quick?  Is there something I should be doing better?  Are my blood sugars a detriment if I go through this routine with elevated sugars (180-200)?  Or should my BGs be more in the normal 120 range while exercising?  My last A1c was 5.8 so I'm fairly well controlled.

Input wanted: Should we allow surveys for research to be posted here?,"Hi everyone, I have a short question for all of you. How do you feel about surveys on the subreddit? Currently we are approving surveys before they are allowed to be posted. We have a few requirements the surveys must meet which are that they have to be about T1D specifically and that it must have a meaningful and realistically achievable goal. This already got rid of most school projects and carb counter apps of which dozens exist already. 

The reason I am asking is because often I have a conversation with the person who wants to post the survey. I check it out and we talk a little about it. However the ones that do get approved barely get any attention. It's not uncommon a mod approved survey sits 0 comments and 0 karma. As a fellow T1D I am aware that we get asked to fill in surveys a lot, and maybe we are just tired of them. If we were to ban all of them we would save everyone a lot of time. We wouldn't need to go through the approval process, and neither would the researchers. And if it only gets the approved surveys 1 or 2 additional responses it just isn't worth it.

Let us know what you think.

Does your endo test for iron?,"I've been t1 for 25+ years. I always felt I knew what I was doing, but in the past couple years, I've decided to take diabetes by the horns and really own it.

The data is beautiful and I'm able to really tighten my control. To make my long story short, my wife and I moved a little while ago and I went to a new endo this past July. My a1c in July was 6.0. I told them I was having some minor hypos around lunch time and tweaked my basal to fix it.

Fast forward to yesterday. I got a call from the office saying my a1c from October was at 5.8. Apparently the doctor asked the nurse to check if I was having hypos. I told her no - according to my Dexcom my 90 day average was 128 and  I was only low for less than 3% of the time (including &lt;1% at or below 55). I felt pretty baller, but now the doctor wants to test my iron levels because they think it might be screwing with my a1c numbers.

Basal Dosage,"Hey all, 

I’m T1 since 2016 and I’m currently taking 60 units of levimir once per day and eating a low-carb diet. Within the past 6 months, I went from requiring about 30 units per day to where I am now. I thought it was due to my honeymoon phase ending and that once I figured out my new, higher dosage I would be able to stabilize everything. 

My endo just told me she will prescribe me no more than 40 units per day and that what I’m taking is too high for a T1. This is obviously concerning because this is what I need not to have elevated blood sugar, especially when I wake up (I’ve tried splitting my dose, doesn’t work well). 

I was panicking the entire time my insulin needs were going up and she seemed nonchalant about the whole thing saying it was just the honeymoon ending and she knew the new number of units required as they were going up above the 40 unit per day threshold. 

It’s bizarre to me that she’s taking issue with this and I don’t know how to proceed. I’m wondering if anyone else has expended this or has thoughts/advice.

Doctors messing with all my things,"Hey guys I need some insight. 
I’m a female (31) type one for 21 years on a tandem pump and using dexcom g6. I’m newly pregnant due in July and seeing an maternal fetal medicine specialist. I have gastroparesis on top of the diabetes. Last A1c was 6.4% in October. 
My sugar levels have been very resistant to my insulin  doses since I discovered I was pregnant I’m reporting my levels weekly to the diabetes educator nurse as part of the specialist team and they have been making all sorts of changes. Most recently they’ve said they want me to start taking Reglan for my gastroparesis because my levels will spike while eating and then again about 4 hours later.  And they’ll hang out in the 200’s for maybe 5 hours. I’m also spiking into the 200s overnight and it won’t come down with corrections. 
The thing is my gastro has not been flaring up with the pregnancy and the risks of reglan do not sound pleasant.  
Does anyone have any thoughts on whether it would be more advisable for me to be taking either the inhaled insulin (afrezza) or fiasp on top of my regular doses of novolog? 
Or something else to help with this insulin resistance and slowed digestion I’m experiencing?  
I’ve scheduled an appointment with my gastroenterologist but was wondering if any other type ones, with gastro, had this experience? I’m already not impressed with the diabetes nurse so any help would be appreciated.

Ypsopump,"Hey all,
So I’ve got this question about the Ypsopump (I’ve been using it for the last year). 

Is it possible to insert the infusion set somewhere other than my stomach? When I got it I was told only to use my stomach, but then Dexcom also say only use your stomach and I see loads of people wearing that on their arms.

I’m asking because if it’s possible I’d really like to attach it in my thigh. I’ve never really injected in my stomach before using this, only ever arms and thighs, because whenever I did it would be very painful, and it would leave horrible marks all over my stomach that wouldn’t go away for weeks after injecting, something that never happens with my arms and legs. 

Having used this device on my stomach for the last year it’s still just as painful as previously injecting there was, and my stomach looks like a battlefield now. I’m also struggling to actually find places to insert it that done interrupt with my Dexcom, it’s getting quite difficult without having them near each other (which I’ve also been told I shouldn’t do).

So yeah long story short, can I insert the Ypsopump into my thigh? Or would it not work.

personally, i was diagnosed at 17 at the very end of my senior year of high school. i had a blood sugar of (only lol) 603 but an a1c of 14.1 and i was in dka. my mom never left my side the entire four days i was in the hospital and learned everything she could in that amount of time. i remember when i was newly diagnosed the summer before i went off to college and she would give me my lantus shot every night because she said that i “would have to deal with this shit for the rest of my life so it’s the least i can do.” for the summer before i got my dexcom she would wake up every night at 3 to check my blood sugar while i was half asleep. she would also record all of my meals and the carbs and my blood sugar so that we could call it into my endo to figure out my changing doses (fucking honeymoon). thankfully she doesn’t have to do any of that anymore since i have a cgm and my levels have evened out, but she still  has been to every endo appointment with me (i’m 21 and my pediatric endo lets patients stay till 26!), she texts me every single time my blood sugar goes low to make sure i’m all right, she keeps up with all the technological advances, and she still fills all my prescriptions while i’m away at college. i’m pretty sure i single handedly have her gray hair. i’m not sure i could have handled the transition from high school to college so smoothly without her. even now that i’ve got a good handle on the day-to-day minutia of diabetes, i’m not sure i could do it without her. i honestly believe that she is the closest you could get to to understanding what it’s like to live with this disease without actually having it.

When DH asked him what type of diabetes he had, the guy only shrugged and said he's not sure. But if I do what he did and also cut out whole wheat bread, I can slowly wean myself off of insulin. 

I'm kinda annoyed that DH even entertained this guy, because I certainly would have flipped. 

I really want to go with DH next time and tell this guy to STFU. My pancreas will never be fully functional again. Without insulin, I die. No vitamin will fix my damn pancreas.

I’ve never used these. I don’t have any of the needles to put onto them. Are they purchasable over the counter? Are they expensive ?

Omnipod for a 4yo,"Hey all -

My daughter was diagnosed late July. It's been a rough few months. We went in for our first A1C test and it went down .9 from diagnosis. Doctors are convinced she's sneaking snacks at 11am (we lol'd at this because she's obviously not) because her levels are all over the place. She'll go from 200 (her target nighttime) to above 400 for no reason, then drop to 200 again by morning - or sometimes not.

I digress...


We were cleared for pump therapy. Yay! We were offered the Omnipod or the Tandem. We love the tubeless idea as she's a little kid and we worry about it being yanked out, but when I saw the Omnipod in person I was shocked to see how large it actually was held up to her body. Does anyone out there have the Omnipod on their little one? I'm wondering how restrictive - if at all - it is for a tiny body.

I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on the Tandem T-Slim and the Omnipod Dash.

She's already wearing a Dexcom G6.

"Dexcom: Why I don't use blood sugar sensors, and why I think they can be drastically improved.","I want to get some feedback on why I still chose not to use blood sugar sensors. Have they improved? If so, please let me know. I have been a diabetic since 2006, and I'm now 20 years old. I'm a 3rd year electric engineering student and have played tennis in college for 2 years.

*Disclaimer: I used the Dexcom G6 a year ago, please let me know if they have since solved any of the following issues*

About a year ago I tried the dexcom G6, and was overall disappointed with my experience, here's why:

1.) Alarms that you can't turn off
I understand that the FDA mandates having an alarm for low blood sugar that can't be turned off, but I found that it made the dexcom system especially annoying to use. I was in a digital logic class, and my blood sugar went below the alarm threshold; it was about 50. So obviously I knew about it and was actively treating the low blood sugar with snacks, but the alarm kept going off periodically throughout the class about 3 times total within a 45 minute period). 

Are there better ways to manage this feature now? In my opinion, this feature alone makes the system not viable for a professional user (someone who has to attend meetings or college classes) because it disrupts everything and gets everyone's attention. My argument for having the option to eliminate this feature is that a manual blood sugar meter doesn't make sound at all - it doesn't even know what your blood sugar is unless you test it!

2.) accuracy and delay
From my understanding, the blood sugar sensor doesn't measure blood sugar directly, it reads a from secondary source (present in the body) which is a good indicator of blood sugar. When I used the dexcom, the blood sugar readings would only update every 5-10 minutes, and they wouldn't be as accurate as a normal blood sugar meter. I believe this is a huge issue for treating lows, because that is where accuracy and delay become very important. A blood sugar difference of 50 and 70 means two completely different things as far as treatment goes. With a 50 I need to eat something immediately and with high sugar content. With a 70  can get away with making a piece of toast (will be more sustaining after my blood sugar has recovered).

3.) Can you save data over a long period of time, on a smart device, and perform statistical analysis on that data? 

I study engineering, so, if I really wanted to I could take all my blood sugar readings, plug them into excel, and have excel run distributions, averages, peaks, etc. Why don't I? That takes way too much time. I think since Dexcom already takes the data for you, it should have the option to add measurements. For instance, you could say ""I want to know my average blood sugar over the last 2 weeks"" to siri or google assistant, and your phone should just be able to tell you based on the data from the dexcom app. If this isn't a possibility right now, I think a bunch of smart engineers would easily be able to figure it out. Engineers at Google are smart enough to track everyone's online profile and use it for ad tracking, they could easily take data that is already stored in the dexcom app, perform calculations on that data, and display it to a user. 

Another application of this would be to display ""danger zones"", where blood sugars typical reach their maximum and minimum on a daily basis. So your phone would tell you: ""hey, based on data from the last month, 2 times a week you have low blood sugars around 3pm, consider lowering your dose for lunch"". I think this is achievable. Has anyone tried to log this autonomously using the current Dexcom system? Please let me know your thoughts, and thanks for reading.",diabetes_t1,1573956994,betus_boi,11,1,True,2019-11-16

Is a cure really close?,"Hey everyone. 

I’ve been diagnosed with diabetes since I was about 13 ( I’m 18 now). I have been struggling managing my blood sugar almost every year. I often try to hide my pump because I don’t want people finding out not that I’m embarrassed I just hate answering the 1000 questions that goes with it. Then of course after they find out I’m a diabetic it’s ohh he can’t have that. He can’t drink that. And I have to answer what feels like 1000’s of questions. My last girlfriend didn’t even know I was a type 1 until a good 2 or 3 months into the relationship whenever she asked about my pump I would avoid it or brush off the question I do it with friends also. I’ve gotten better at managing it, staying mostly in the 100’s but when I was in the hospital I remember being told my doctors and nurses that a cure was right around the corner with stem cell research. Well that was years ago and I’m starting to sort of lose hope. I’m not expecting to see a cure anytime soon and I feel like I have pretty realistic expectations. Will I see a cure in my lifetime? Are we really actually close? Or is it just false hope I remember seeing articles years ago saying things like “new breakthrough for type 1 cure” or “type one cure right around the corner with stem cell project being funded” is this a legitimate thing?

Dealing with people who feel free to judge young diabetics,"I recently started at a new position, and although I’m not a medical provider, I’m in the same office as the providers in a school health center.  Over the last few days, the nurses have been complaining about one student, an 8th grader with T1D.  Apparently, she often comes in running high (300s-400s), and “doesn’t even care.”  She’s apparently not on a pump or CGM (our center serves primarily low-income patients), and I’ve tried to explain how that makes management exponentially more difficult.  

Well, she came in today, same routine - running high, needed insulin (nurse has to give it to her, they won’t let her self-administer).  As soon as she left, they all started in on how she’s just “bad” - she eats junk food, she doesn’t keep disciplined schedule, and “clearly doesn’t care about her future.”  They then started talking about other T1D students they’d had, sorting them into “bad” and “good” diabetics.  I finally snapped at them, “None of you are dealing with a chronic illness that is present every minute.  I was diagnosed in middle school, and being a diabetic in middle school is lousy, and criticizing her and telling her she’s bad doesn’t help at all.  She’s probably been running high for so long, it feels normal to her.  It would take her weeks of tight control to even realize how sick she feels at this point.” 

It was a very uncomfortable moment, but I’m so sick of the good/bad diabetic paradigm, and how damaging it is for young diabetics to hear.  That kind of thinking helped me to ignore my diabetes for years - I mean, I’m a bad diabetic, and I’m going to die of this, anyway, so what’s the point?

When should I actually use a glucagon shot?,"Hi folks!

I've had t1 diabetes for about 22 years now. I've been really fortunate and have never experienced extreme lows, and I've never gone into insulin shock or hypoglycemic seizure.  


Recently I started Ozempic to help with insulin sensitivity and lower my A1C -- it's been great, but I find that I'm having a lot more lows because my body has become extremely sensitive to exercise (aka, walking for 30 minutes now makes me super sensitive to insulin). I can usually catch them before they get below 50, but it starts to freak me out when it gets below that point. When should I actually start freaking out about a low blood sugar? When should I take a glucagon shot or call 911? Should I wait until I'm nearly unconscious (my endo said to use it when I no longer felt like I could swallow food)?

Any advice appreciated. Thanks!",diabetes_t1,1573697757,_cryborg,5,1,True,2019-11-13

[Rant] Very slow reaction to Novorapid,"The activity of novorapid for me is around 7 to 8 hours and peaks at around 3 hours. This means that even if my meals are very low glycemic index (and somehow even if I eat only meat) I spike about 5 to 10 mmol/L and then crash extremely low after about 5 hours. I am now eating only two meals a day and getting far too little food. I'm injecting half an hour in advance and nothing at all seems to be working. It was fine until very recently and then everything went crazy. To make matters worse, whenever I'm above 8 mmol/L I have a headache that feels like my brain is being ripped in half and I am completely unable to concentrate. Everything was fine and then suddenly it all became nightmarishly difficult and I cannot live an even remotely normal life. Like I will literally drop from 15 mmol/L to 2 mmol/L over the span of thirty minutes and five hours after an injection. My basal is on point and I am completely stable when eating nothing.

Reset Dexcom Transmitter &amp; Battery Life,"I  started using a Dexcom G6 last June. My first transmitter, I could easily perform the 15 min restart strategy for Sensors and consistently re use them. However, my new transmitter is not allowing this. Based upon the serial number on the new transmitter and other guides I have read on reddit and other sites, I could reset the new transmitter to re use sensors as well.

However, part of my thought process involves a few questions:

\- How long have any of you been able to use a G6 Transmitter after resetting it after the 3 month hard stop?

\- When a transmitter is not in use with a sensor, is its battery still drained? I wonder if I could reset the old transmitter and continue to use it for 1-2 more months, even though it has just been sitting in a box since its hard stop around 6 weeks ago. If I did this and didn't use the new one for a while, would its battery continue to drain (ignoring the hard stop date because I could reset it)?",diabetes_t1,1573590396,ViperD182,1,1,True,2019-11-12

Hookup Culture &amp; T1D,"After sex, my blood sugar drops very quickly (between 75 and 50 in some cases).

Drinking orange juice afterwards is just not sexy and can be a weird situation for me to explain. There can be so much stigma around diabetes and I don't want to have to explain myself all the time.

Advice: How do you handle working a job that interferes with meal times?,"TLDR: My shifts at work are messing up meal times and I need advice on how to adapt to eating on the go/ not skipping meals.

Hi all, 23 yo student here, diagnosed 9 years ago. Usually very good control... I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation where work has made control very difficult. I have a Christmas job in retail where I am working 4 hour shifts 5 days a week, meaning legally I don't get break time (UK). 

This would be fine except all of my shifts are at lunch time (12pm-4pm) or dinner time (5pm-9pm). This means eating lunch at 11.30am or 4.30pm, or dinner at 4.30pm or 9.30pm. Over the last twp weeks ive actually ended up skupping a lot of meals because of it and my blood sugars have been very unstable because of it (spikes before bed or when I'm eating meals close together, hypos in the night).

I am not on a pump or CGM, just self testing and injections. I feel like I can't complain at work as I am kind of replaceable and am hoping for a contract extension after Christmas and job competition is really high in my city.

Share your T1D Origin Story?,"Hey Everyone!

Recently I documented my origin story of finding out that I was a T1 Diabetic. I found it very therapeutic and I would love to help newly diagnosed T1Ds (and even life long T1Ds) with stories from the community. For me, there was a strong feeling of “why me?” or “how could this happen?” and plenty of “I'm sure I'll wake up tomorrow and this will only be only a nightmare” that I’m sure all of us felt at some time or another. I wanted to compile and publish origin stories from Type 1 Diabetics that show that others have gone through the same challenge and emphasize the point that we are not alone in this battle. I wish I had stories of others when I was a newly diagnosed T1D so I don’t feel like I was on my own figuring out my new life. Honestly, the mental challenges is far harder than the physical.    


I hope to expand to stories with various helpful topics like: what I wish I knew on day 1, tricks to living a better life and maybe even topics like what being Type 1 Diabetic has done for me in a positive way (in my case, I eat a ton healthier, take exercise more seriously and feel grounded when other little things go wrong in my life). But first, I would love to document the beginning and build from there. 

Please share feedback, DM me and hopefully, if you’re comfortable, your short stories.

Mom won't leave me [18f] alone about blood sugars,"I've been t1d for nearly 7 years, always had what my doctors call very good control (a1c under 7, usually around 6 since about a year after diagnosis). I'm on a pump and have dexcom g6 that I use constantly (and my parents follow my dex). Since I was diagnosed when i was already a very independent 12 year old, I took the lead on my diabetes management and have pretty much done everything myself for the last 7 years. My parents are there to support me, and my mom has helped me fight with insurance, deal with bad pump sites, bleeders, etc. They're incredibly helpful and my biggest supporters in everything. 

However my mom is really controlling. She has her own anxieties and issues, which she tends to project onto me. Basically she texts and bothers me constantly when my sugar is &gt;180, even though I don't need a reminder to deal with a high and we've discussed that. In high school it wasn't too bad, since I was home a lot and she could see that I was bolusing for the highs or changing my pump site out when I needed to. 

Now I'm a freshman in college, living in the dorms. I live 20 minutes from my parents (which I'm okay with, I like my school), so it's not as if they couldn't get to me if something happened--and my school is in a big city, 10 minutes away from my doctors and some amazing hospitals, so if anything serious happened I'm literally 10 minutes away from the nearest emergency care. 

we talked about it before I left and agreed that when I'm low, I get a simple ""you ok?"" text from mom or dad (or both), and if I don't answer within 15 minutes they can call me to check in. When I'm over 200, we agreed that they could text me **once** after about an hour if my sugar isn't budging. 

My mom totally does not go by this agreement and I'm furious. when I'm high, she texts me once, asking if I'm okay. Once I say yes, she gives it another 30 minutes before saying ""it's not budging?"", then continues to text me again and again every 30 minutes at least to ask whether I'm changing my site, if I'm handling it, what I'm doing, etc. 

I feel like diabetics understand that sometimes, you just get those stubborn-ass highs that don't go away no matter what you try!! And now that my stress levels are back up from hard classes, and it took me months to adjust to the dining hall diet, new sleep schedule, and new friends, those stubborn highs have been coming up more frequently. 

so yeah, I don't have straight lines on my dexcom anymore. whatever. I'm happier, my doctors have said multiple times that they have no concerns and I'm doing great, and my last a1c a couple months ago was 6. 

my mom STILL won't leave me alone, even after I tell her how much it bothers me. When she constantly bugs me and asks what I'm doing about my sugars, it makes me feel like she thinks I'm incapable of handling things on my own, even though I've been doing it for years. I know she's coming from a place of genuine concern and worry, but it feel so hurtful. A few months ago she even asked if I was intentionally making my sugars high and not correcting them (It was a few times in one week that they were never over 350, and always came down within a few hours). I was so furious that I didn't even yell, I just sternly told her that I would never do something like that and was incredibly hurt that she thought something like that when I've been doing really well emotionally. 

Sorry for this being long, she's texting me as I write this and it's infuriating. I do have a therapist and plan to bring this up w her next session, but I won't be seeing her for another week.

TL;DR My mom constantly texts me when I'm over 200, won't leave me alone no matter how much I ask, and makes me feel like I'm not capable of handling my own diabetes. My a1c is 6 and my doctors are super happy with my current control.",diabetes_t1,1573521920,jaceybabyy,22,1,True,2019-11-11

"Diagnosed as t1 for approximately a year, no insulin needed for stable blood sugar?","\[20yr old male, 174cm [72.1.kg](https://72.1.kg)\] sorry if my english is bad, it's not my native language. 

On November of 2018, I was  diagnosed with T1D and admitted to the hospital with a high blood sugar, extreme thirst, weight loss, etc. Upon being admitted, I was initially given the treatment of 40 units of toujeo every mornign and 30 units of novorapid before every meal. 

I was on this treatment for about a month before I discovered that I no longer needed the novorapid injections for my blood sugar level to be stable (with a bg level averaging from 80-130) after meals. However, I did continue to take the toujeo shots every morning at 10:30AM for the past year which did keep my blood sugar stable if not low and had to take extra carbs if I was doing a workout as that would put my blood sugar extremely low.

Now this treatment has been going on for about a year now with the exception of me lowering my toujeo levels every time my fasting bg would be low, as told to do by the clinic. My dosages kept on falling for the past year, as illustrated below.

Toujeo intake:

Jan \~ March 2018: 40 \~ 34 units

March \~ May 2019 : 34 \~ 18 units

May \~ Sep. 2019 : 18 \~ 4 units

Sep. \~ Nov. 2019: 4 \~ 3 units

As of November, I am now down to 2 units every morning. My blood sugar 2hrs after a meal sits at about 80 and even lower at midnight, making me have to take 15g of carbs to treat for the lows. I was initially told by my doctor that it may be an extensive honeymoon period but I now require minimal to none insulin treatment after 1 year of diagnosis. 

I even tried taking a full meal of mcdonalds just to see if it would spike my bloodsugar without the novorapid injections but my bs 2hrs after the meal sat at about 108.

Now even this 2 units of toujeo is giving me constant lows even when I don't skip meals, have a full breakfast and lunch consisting of about 2500calories a day, eating at a specified time. 

Open to all feedback and advices before I see my doctor next week, much appreciated.",diabetes_t1,1573374982,kermitonh,26,1,True,2019-11-10

Can't seem to find the right insulin requirements and doctors aren't helping me,"I've been diabetic for 12 years. It's always been pretty wonky but I've always been good about figuring out what my body needs as far as insulin. I'm pretty insulin resistant and sensitive at the same time. So many things can change that. 

Especially lately. It's been hard finding patterns to pin point exactly what is effecting me. I log everything. I have tried different ways of eating I've seen 6 different endos and none of them feel comfortable adjusting my insulin doses. Ive been trying to figure it out my self. I'm jumping through hoops to try and get a pump. I'm at my wits end I've dropped 5 times today. Tomorrow I will probably be in the 300s. Theres no in between. 

I know the pump will help me if I can figure out what my body needs and why but I just cant. I'm starting to accept the fact that I wont and will host die you g of complications.

T1D and cannabis,"Adult onset (age 26) T1D here. Been living with the disease for about 8 years now. While I'm stable and in control for the most part, I absolutely relate to recent posts about depression related to diabetes. 

Switching last year to Freestyle cgm and no more finger pricks helped reduce incidence of depression for me, and obviously helped my bg control.

Before that, the most helpful lifestyle adjustment I made was becoming a medical marijuana patient in my state. Cannabis simply helps quiet my mind, though depending on the strain I have to fight food cravings. 

Another redditor was downvoted for suggesting cannabis for diabetes-related depression, so I'm curious how others use or avoid cannabis for this reason. More clinical research exists for cannabis and T2D, but maybe someone can share T1 studies.

Optimal Insulin Timing,"I am a 22yo M, 189lbs and 12%bf. I was diagnosed in Aug 2018. I am very active and compete at a high level in both Weightlifting and Crossfit.

Training and exercising so much definitely helps me control my blood glucose levels. 

However, I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions for the optimal timing of insulin? As well as the proper response curve of blood glucose following a meal? I have read that an insulin sensitive person should reach 110 within an hour after their meal. I use an Omnipod pump with Novolog insulin. I have found, in a lot of cases, a proper bolus timed 20-30 minutes before eating has served me the best with maintaining a smaller spike in blood sugar levels. Higher GI carbs, such as a gatorade post exercise, tend to make the spike last longer. Would these higher GI carbs require earlier timing?",diabetes_t1,1573426352,ViperD182,3,1,True,2019-11-10

Problems with Enlite2 sensors on 640g,"Hello guys, recently I got 640g with enlite2 sensors(only ones available in my country) everything was okay when I was using the sensor which was inserted by woman which was responsible for teaching me how to use the system. But yesterday when sensor stopped working and I inserted new one by myself problems began. I inserted it on my butt waited for 2 hours to warmup, got notification to calibrate, I did it and showed my BG accuratly about one hour but then it started fall down and after 2 or 3 hours it showed that I am below 2.2mmol(less than 40mg I guess?) which waas not true I checked with finger prick and it showed that my BG was 7mmol so I calibrated again because second calibration is needed in 6hours after first calibration but it still showed that I am below 2.2mmol and calibration wasnt accepted and after 15minutes pump asked me to recalibrated it again and same story happened so I thought that I inserted it badly so I inserted new sensor on lower back started like new one and same story with it happened. Now I inserted third one on my butt again but now while inserting it  with inserter I pushed my inserter a little bit harder it hurted but now it doesnt show that I am  below 2.2mmol although I got many notifications  that I am low at night which was no true and now after +12hours its pretty inaccurate so I am confused what I am doing wrong maybe my insertion could be wrong? I saw that people manually inserting them so I thinking can manually insertion help me or people does this only when their inserter brokes.

Alcohol (Binging) Induced Insulin Resistance?,"Hi all!

Backstory: Recently went on an overseas trip, and after having come back I have noticed my blood sugars creeping about 1.5 times higher on average (floating around 6mmol/L -&gt; 9mmol/L), without any change in basal and bolus insulin loads. Now, it is fair to say I was drinking a lot on the trip, a lot more than usual. Like, a lot. Probably did not go a day without at least one or two drinks and had a many a big night out (on holiday, may as well live a little!). Eating more negligently too, but nothing crazy. 

But I suppose I am bit more wary now - after a good week getting back into a strict regimen, my blood sugar seems to be still drifting high even in a relatively fasting state. Curious as to the possible cause, I read this paper about [alcohol-induced insulin resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740748/). Apparently, in a rat-based model, even 54 hours after blood alcohol is zero, rats suffered insulin resistance. From my understanding it's a complex pathway modulated by the liver. When the liver processes alcohol, it up-regulates insulin-binding transporters and lowers glucose secretion, to focus on detoxifying the blood. When sudden alcohol withdrawal occurs, the opposite occurs, the liver down-regulates insulin-binding transporters and increases glucose secretion.

I suppose I am sort of hopeful this is the cause and everything will eventually settle. Otherwise I'll have to basically up my insulin dosages, perhaps a coincidental 'honeymoon-ending' type effect. My question is, has anyone had similar experiences? I know alcohol is generally tolerated badly in the t1d community, any stories or discussions are more than welcome!",diabetes_t1,1573104061,meme_dream_1900,2,1,True,2019-11-07
New here so here's my story (it's long so read it if you have a couple minutes),"M 55 y.o., 5' 10"", 168 lbs.

I was diagnosed with type 1 some 44 years ago. I guess I have achieved ""Crafty Veteran"" status. ;-)  The treatment of diabetes was far different back in the mid70s.  The disposable needles were new to the scene.  The three types of insulin (L, R, and NPH) were taken from pigs and cows.  Blood monitors didn't exist.  Rather, there was this test tape you would have to pee on to see your approximate blood sugar level within the last 6 hours.  Unreliable.  There was one major sugar-free soda: Tab, which was pretty awful but I learned to love.  As a kid receiving a diagnosis the doctors and nurses approached it with unreasonable expectations.  ""No sugar ever. No birthday cake with friends, no ice cream in the summer, no s'mores at the campfire, no Halloween candy, no Trix and Cap'n Crunch, nothing. Ever. No!""  They forced you into hiding your occasional Oreo birthday dalliances rather than help you deal with the blood sugars when they became raised.  The standard then was to count calories by using an ""exchange"" diet.  There would be a diet set up for you by a dietician who factored in your caloric needs based on age, growth rate, activity level, etc.  Every single day you would eat the same types of food in the same quantities because the types of insulin would be most effective this way.

The needles on the syringes were 27 gauge about four times as thick as the 31 gauge needles today.  The first consumer level blood monitor hit the market around 1977 and it wasn't easy.  You would be fortune to get a reading within 8 minutes.  The machine was quadruple the size of today's monitors so packing it to take with you was an ordeal.  It required calibration every time you turned it on, a two minute process.  You then had to do a trial run with a solution that had a preset level of sugar.  If the reading was within a specified range the machine was good to go.  After calibration and successful testing you inserted the test strip which required a HUGE drop of blood. Too little wouldn't work and you would have to toss the test strip.  By this time the machine would often shut off and you'd have to start from scratch.  After adding the big drop of blood to the test strip you had to rinse it after 30 seconds being careful not to do it early or wait too long.  Then, after another minute or so it would give you a reading.  Ugh!

The pig based insulin was scary.  The human DNA origin insulin of today is very user friendly.  That old stuff would cause reactions that were extreme.  It interfered with my ability to think, often causing incoherent actions, spasms, and a loss of verbal communication to the point that I only could speak two words: ""yes"" and ""no"".  The human insulin reactions are a walk in the park comparatively.  The reactions would slowly set in until it flipped an on/off switch in my thought processes.  During a severe reaction people would always ask questions but they were yes/no questions.  ""Are you okay?""  ""Yes.""  ""Do you need help?""  ""No!""  The concerned people would gather around because they could tell something wasn't right.  I would get defensive because my brain was misfiring and because I was surrounded by a dozen unfamiliar faces all talking about me.  I only got kicking-people-away violent once but that's once too many.  I have been ejected out of stores and restaurants and classrooms until I could ""pull yourself together, man.  Why are you doing drugs and coming in here, dude?""

The way things have progressed and advanced in the treatment of diabetes is quite remarkable.  Things are easier now.  My time anymore isn't overwhelmed with strict dieting and monitoring and freaking out about misinformation.  I have been told my whole life that a remedy for the condition is just around the corner, maybe even in a couple years.  I am still waiting patiently.  haha

I handle my diabetes with Admelog and Basaglar pens.  I am an archaeologist by trade so I have no capability to use insulin pumps that can be crushed, lost, or yanked out deep in the jungle where disease is abundant and cleanliness is unexpected.  I do not get A1C readings more than once a year because I am on MediCal that doesn't support super attentiveness to health.  It's a program that endorses simple maintenance rather than aggressive proactive treatment.  My A1C readings have been in the 7 to 8 range and I am pleased with that.  I count carbs and adjust the insulin according to the quantity of food I eat which varies from day to day.  I am afforded enough test strips to test twice a day and I do well with it.

I'm a type 1 for 24 years myself and I sometimes wonder how other people live with their diabetes. How do they get affected by certain foods? What type of treatment are they on? Do they suffer from anxiety? Are they happy?

The idea became more clear and I started working on a blog where I can publish interviews with people having diabetes. I worked out a first version of the interview and posted it on Reddit. I received about 25 positive answers and in the meanwhile I received 13 filled in interviews back.

Currently I am working on the website in the hope to launch a first MVP in November.

If you have diabetes or know someone that has diabetes, you can always fill in or share the current interview: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLyb-psxQZ85KAOveXXwsR3eL98OuHFldJ3dd9azqYGYZbhQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLyb-psxQZ85KAOveXXwsR3eL98OuHFldJ3dd9azqYGYZbhQ/viewform)

Question to those with t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6 CGM: Notification Settings,"I've been using a Dexcom G6 for several months along with a Medtronic 530G. I've loved having my readings on my phone and watch.

However, I just switched to a Tandem t:slim X2 this week and while I love having the readings on my pump again, I still find it convenient to have them on *also* on my phone/watch. The problem is if I have a high/low notification, I have to acknowledge it both on my phone and pump. Not a huge detail but it can become somewhat bothersome in certain situations such as driving or presenting during a meeting at work. 

How do you have your alerts/notifications set up? Should I just turn off my phone alerts and then if my pump alerts on, check my phone/watch to see if it's a high/low that needs acknowledging? Or vice versa; turn off pump alerts and leave the phone ones on? It looks like both could be a possibility but I just looking to get others' opinions.

Fiancé with T1D (27M) just got put on statins. How can I help with better food prep and lifestyle choices?,"My fiancé has had T1 for 3 years now and while he has the usual struggles of T1 his A1C is usually great. On his last two labs though his LDL has been high and they put him on statins. 

I cook almost all of our meals and prep our lunches every week. My fiancé is a bit overweight at 161  pounds 5ft 7in, but he’s been running 3x a week for the last 6 or so months gradually increasing the time he spends doing it. Right now he runs for 30 minutes. 

He doesn’t eat breakfast and instead drinks a
Pure Protein shake. For lunches I always make sandwiches with a small side (usually about half a cup of low carb chips). For dinner, I typically do a protein and a low carb side (usually veggies).  He tends to take pretty large portions of both though and we already  agreed he needs to eat smaller dinner portions and cut out after dinner desserts (which he tends to grab). 

We also talked about eating more salads and leaner meats in addition to him having smaller portions.

My issue comes in that I actually need to gain weight. I’m 80 pounds, 4ft 10. Since we do our meals together I fear it’s going to be a struggle for me to eat less heavy foods than we are now and that it’s going to bring down my weight more. If I eat larger portions, he’s going to do so too and I know it because if I’m eating something he feels like he does too. Sometimes if he’s hungry he’ll ask me to make food for myself and then he’ll eat some of it because he can’t resist.

Usually when his blood sugar is low he’ll also grab candy or desserts instead of his sugar tabs. I feel like this is something he needs to change, but he says he can’t see himself cutting out candy and I feel awful telling him to because he already can’t have a lot of desserts.",diabetes_t1,1573139479,doveclyn,18,1,True,2019-11-07
Picking Insurance Q,"It's that time of year again to pick next year's insurance coverage. I'm in the US. My options are either Anthem Base PPO or Kaiser HMO. On paper Kaiser looks good, I've had the Anthem coverage for a while and it's OK, but I'm not tied down to it or my current doctors. The Endo I loved just moved States so I'm in the market for a new one anyways. Because both coverages are fairly similar in cost, max out of pocket, and copays, how do I determine which would be better for my T1? I'm not sure how I'm supposed to know without taking a year of Kaiser.

I so have an HSA matched by my company, but it's separate from my insurance coverage.

How long do you think you had T1D before diagnosis?,"There is no reliable information I am aware of that indicates how long it takes for T1D to develop, particularly for late onset. For myself, I believe I was mildly symptomatic up to a year or slightly more. I remember about a year before diagnosis I began to feel nauseous both after eating high carb or large meals and completely losing my taste for any type of cake, ice cream, chocolate. 

I tend to wonder how long, as the pancreas is being slowly destroyed, can you run in the range of 120-200, gradually getting higher as more of it is broken down. I also wonder how much damage is done to the body in that time, and I certainly wish there was more information out there. I caught it after not feeling well, going to a clinic, and having to return the next morning so they could verify my fasting blood sugar was 350. I never even had to go to the ER. Just the family doctor where I was tested , and the diagnosis confirmed. One year later I'm sure I owe my now 5.3 A1C to the slow, slow deterioration of my pancreas, hopefully leading to a honeymoon period that will last years. 

I'd say one of the most frustrating things about this disease is the lack of concrete information on nearly any aspect of it.",diabetes_t1,1573148041,DoobleDecker,12,1,True,2019-11-07

My last HbA1c was 40 mmol/mol and it was taken at the same time as my avg. glucose was ~6 as stated above. So my avg. glucose has gone down but my time in range, lows and highs have not changed. 

Is it possible my HbA1c could be too low? An endo said that ”everything under 53mmol/mol is good” but I doubt it since I’m low over 20% of the time.

CGM was denied by Insurance - Tips for appeal letter?,"Just received a claim denial notice from my insurance for my Dexcom and feeling really emotional. 

 I was told by my supplier, Care Centrix that it was covered back in Sept./Oct which is why I gave them the ok to ship out my supplies. But now, a month later I'm receiving a denial notice. AFTER THE FACT. So obviously, I can't return my supplies and I'm stuck with a bill. I'm not sure if I can afford this anymore even though this is a clear necessity! I have hypoglycemia unawareness but that aside - this helps me so much with my management. I don't want to be without it but now I may have to.

Stopping pre dinner bolus,"Hi I'm 27 year old male Benn diabetic for 15 years and something strange has been happening, after dinner I recently kept going low 2.7mmol out of nowhere around the same time every night , no change to diet or dose of bolus (10u) so  basically over the last short while I've pretty much cut back my bolus to 1 or 2 units before dinner

What I'd like to know is this bad for me even though my sugars are staying within 4-9 mmol without nighttime bolus? Or should I work back up to where I was dose wise and just eat a load more? I'm on 42 units lantus in the morning also

Introduction and brief question,"Can't recall if I've posted here previously, but thought I'd try giving this forum a shot. Just for some context here, I've been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 6 or 7 (can't remember the precise time of diagnosis at the moment) and I'm 28 now, so a little over 2 decades with this disease. Over this time, I've had admittedly poor control over my diabetes to the point where it could have been classified as ""brittle diabetes."" As you might suspect, I've started to develop complications (progressive retinopathy, which I've managed to stall more or less at the moment) and what I believe to be indications of neuropathy over the past few years. Despite all of this, within the past year, I've made a serious, committed efforts to maintain steady, healthier blood sugar levels (latest A1C went down to 7.2!). Throughout most of my childhood and adolescence, I was a very skinny, gaunt looking kid, but my metabolism has since slowed down considerably now and I need to lose weight (5'11'', 260 pounds... deep depression and bad decisions over past few years... working to fix this). Something I'd been curious about recently though was my diminished awareness around hypoglycemic episodes (BG levels as low as 40s or 50s). When I was much younger, I'd be much more attuned and aware of such episodes and was often fast to correct them, but now they are challenging to distinguish from unrelated bouts of fatigue (lack of sleep due to working night shifts for example). Do any of you folks have any idea why this might be?? I've been living a quite sedentary lifestyle for a while and have only recently begun to exercise more, so perhaps this might play into it, but I'm not sure. Let me know what you all think of this. Apologies for the lengthy, long-winded introduction, but my scatterbrained mindset tends to bleed into my writing.",diabetes_t1,1572855916,SirBeardsAlot91,4,2,True,2019-11-04

New to this. Can someone explain the time window on hypoglycemic before irreprable damage?,"My 7 year old son is on the spectrum and was recently diagnosed as T1.  We're working with his school and hospital on his plan to keep his blood sugar at the correct levels and have so far been having success.

One concern we have is due to his autism he does not show symptoms of being hypoglycemic.  We recently (this past weekend) had an episode where we were getting him ready for lunch to find out he was at 2.9 mmol/l which to my understanding is dangerously low.

So what we've been told is everyone will reach a point where their blood glucose levels are so low they will go into a coma.  At that point you are to use glucagon, call 911, etc.

But let's say he's at school.  They are not authorized to administer the glucagon which means they call 911 and wait for an ambulance.

My fear is without understanding the severity of a situation where he has gone into a coma due to low blood sugar, is are we dealing with an ""every second counts"" scenario?  Even if the ambulance arrives in say 5 - 10 minutes is that 5 - 10 minutes where he is left without glucagon the difference between reversable and irreversable damage?",diabetes_t1,1572897136,whoisearth,9,1,True,2019-11-04

Need some advice after seizure and ER visit,"I'm a 23/M and I've been diagnosed for 20 years with Type 1. 

Last night (Sunday) when riding on the subway I had a low blood sugar. This is where it gets weird.

My Dexcom said my blood sugar was 77 and when I was taken into the ambulance about 5-10 minutes later they tested my blood sugar at 98. The thing is I could feel myself going low quickly about 10 minutes before the ambulance came  and becoming kind of wobbly so I decided to drink 2 cokes and a ton of fruit snacks really quickly. 

The reason why my friend called the ambulance is because I subsequently started seizing and ended up blacking out. In the hospital they administered glucagon as well as gave me an IV drip. I fell so hard on the ground I injured my back and needed Tylenol. I also bit down so hard on my tongue my jaw as well as my tongue hurts. Has anyone have this happen to them during a seizure?

This is only the second time I've blacked out in my life but I have gotten seizures before but drank coke quickly enough to bring it back up.

I was subsequently released from the hospital after around 4 hours. And I feel fine now except my jaw and back hurts which makes sense.

Today (Monday) however its been literally impossible for me to bring my blood sugar under 250. I've changed insulin pens and needles (I don't use a pump just Toujeo in a pen and Novolog), I've been eating a low amount of carbs etc. I've literally done everything.

American family considering moving abroad for universal health care," 

First I wanted to say that this forum has been invaluable to my husband and I. More helpful than any doctors or nurses we’ve met. I am really grateful for the opportunity to talk and listen to Type 1s unfiltered. We thank you all. 

Our 12 y.o. son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes a bit over a year ago. He’s smart and capable and before the diagnosis he could really do anything he set his mind to but after learning the daily reality of this disease, and even more about the american healthcare system, we’re realizing that he will have to take healthcare coverage and benefits as a huge consideration in his choice of career in America because he has a chronic illness. 

My husband and I have traveled and lived abroad and love it. We think that moving abroad would be a good choice for our son once he’s no longer insured under us, or sooner, but think it would be hard for him to do it alone after living in one place for so many years. 

We’re wondering if we should move our family abroad sooner than later. Would we be doing our son a favor by exposing him to another culture with universal healthcare (and schooling) at a young age or just let him figure it out on his own when he’s an adult.

Here’s some details. 

We live in Manhattan Beach, California and have as comfortable a life as you can have with a Type 1 in the family and exorbitant health insurance costs and copays (our insurance went up 25% again this year).

He’s our only child. For him we’d need good schools, he’s in 7th grade, and a coast with a harbor and kids sailing program. We’re not sailors but he fell in love with sailing when he was young and now sails Optis (Optimists) competitively. It’s his first love.

I’m a desert girl so I need somewhere relatively warm. We lived in NYC for a decade and moved to California after having enough of the winters. I’m worried about going somewhere with a friendly culture, open to foreigners.

My husband runs his own consulting company from home with clients all over the world but his main remote team is in the Bay Area (San Francisco) so compatibility with Pacific Coast Time Zone is a consideration. Otherwise his job is pretty flexible.

Like I said, we’re comfortable here and honestly I’m a bit terrified about making such a big move but we’re wondering if we’re being short sighted. I’m also wondering if we could move somewhere we’re considering temporarily for a year to check it out.  

Here are some questions:

* Do you wish your parents had moved you to a country universal health coverage? Do you wish you had moved yourself to such a country? Are you considering moving? Have you moved from America abroad to a country with universal health coverage and how is it going?
* Where should we consider moving? Australia, New Zealand and Spain have come to mind. Any other countries?
* Are we a) over thinking this and engineering too much of his life and should let him decide on his own when the time comes, or b) smart realistic parents taking advantage of our opportunities and resources and doing what’s best for our family, or….

I think I will also post on the Chronic Illness Reddit forum for the first time because this challenge is really present for any American with a Chronic Illness.

Tslim Cartridge Questions,"Hi all! Not new to pumping, very new to tandem. I have a few questions about refilling the cartridge and would appreciate it a lot if anyone has any insight to offer!

So, I know the process of how to refill it, but it seems like I have a different issue each time. 

Sometimes it feels like no matter how many units of air I pull out, more still wants to come out. How much air should I be removing before filling with insulin? How do I know when I've pulled all the air out? 

I feel like I waste so much insulin tapping the air bubbles out of the needle; there has got to be a more efficient method I'm missing. What I currently do is pull back a bunch of air, flick the bubbles into one big air bubble, then prime it out, along with lots of insulin it seems. 

Finally: tonight when filling my cartridge, the syringe did not seem to want to move at all, until suddenly it felt like something inside the cartridge ""released"" so to speak, and suddenly I had no problem filling it all, however I did end up having to fill almost 22 units in my 23 inch tubing in order to get rid of all the air bubbles in it.

Bedtime Value Q plus hello!,"Howdy All, 

So I’m a 31 year old dude diagnosed about 2 weeks ago with late onset type 1 - yippee!! It seems like nearly everyone on here has a pump but it’s early days for me so on novarapid and basarglar (sp?) and finding my feet with it. 

Had a hba1c of 91 (that’s UK terminology so that’s in mmol/mol which translates to 250mg/dl or 10.5% according to this helpful graphic I found on google image). That was the trigger for the diagnosis having doubled since the previous one was borderline 3 months before (literally doubled on the nose so 45 / 125 / 5.25%). 

Anyway it’s been alright, I think I’ve found my feet with the measurements for the moment and today’s values have been good, no higher than 8 mmol/l (finger prick) but now am at the stage where I’m at 5.0, at bedtime and still got a little insulin on board having taken 3 units at dinner (about 3 hours ago). What’s the lowest value I can safely go to sleep with in peoples experience?

Most mornings recently I’ve woken up with higher values then when I went to bed - I think that’s the “dawn phenomenon” and so I’ve no idea how much it’ll continue to drop overnight, if it does at all.

Basal/Bolus Ratio,"Hello, 

In the last 9 months, I've slowly lost about 10 pounds through daily exercise. Essentially, I'm trying to figure out what's happening (would like any advice, see below). 

 Over the last two months, my Basal/Bolus ratio has gone from about 65%/35% to about 80%/20% most days. I had an endo appointment a few weeks ago and he seemed to think I was fine, but it isn't fine. I find myself having to eat about 20-25 carbs in the a.m. after going from okay before bed to low in the morning, just to correct. Additionally, depending on how much I eat on any given day, my IC ratio seems to be all over the place. Also, my blood sugar ALWAYS crashes during exercise. I think this is from having too much basal stacked on board. 

As a result, the last couple days I've slowly started to reduce my basal to a more reasonable amount. My TDD is around 55 units. Instead of giving 43 units of basal, I'm shooting for around 35, and then subsequently increasing my meal time insulin. Is it okay to get to reduce to that amount fairly quickly? I know the 50/50 thing is hard to get to (and not even realistic for some people), but I feel like my body is changing and my control is not where I would like. I'm also upset that my endo doesn't think this is a problem. I was at 6.7% a1c in June, and now I'm at 7.2. 

As suggested, any advice or opinions about any of this would be great. Thanks",diabetes_t1,1572823647,ata9144,7,1,True,2019-11-03

Alcohol and Late nights,"So I’m a college student who recently became legal to drink (US 21).

Curious how other T1D's are keeping insulin cold during d2d activities?,"Hello All,

New to this subreddit and am very excited about the community that us here so props to all! I have been wondering and struggling to provide an efficient method of keeping Insulin pens cool during outdoor activities such as backpacking, mountain biking, going to the races, or concerts. I have done some testing with different pens and found a correlation to the effectiveness of the medicine and how often it is exposed to higher then refrigerated temperatures. So, my Insulin skews to a higher carb to the unit ratio when in hotter environments for prolonged period of time, so I have to switch pens to a newer pen before depletion to bring the ratio back down.

I know this is not ideal, and it's not good to test this or allow insulin to become warm or heated (Sunny outdoor environments through average day to day use, not anything abnormally hot)

I also know the current solution is to just put an ice pack of some sort in my case to keep insulin cool, but they often melt after a short duration of time and don't last all day. Or carry a cooler I suppose.

Insulin honeymoon over. Advice on dealing with the anxiety,"I'm 31 years old, was diagnosed about 6 months ago.

My control is pretty good and my sugars are mostly in non diabetic levels BUT it 1) limits what I can eat so much - I realize _IN THEORY_ I can eat whatever I want but the blood sugar rollercoaster is a pain in the ass 2) its inconvenient, sleeping with a pump attached to me sucks, etc, so many factors and the main reason for topic 3) its making me anxious about the future.

"I'm going to test for T1, here's my situation"," Hey all,

I want to preface this by saying I have made a doctor's appointment for next weekend to do a blood test, but the wait i turning out to be very dreadful so I wanted to hear some second opinions on my situation.

So my mother told me over a year ago that she thinks i could have diabetes type one because drink a lot of water and also experience increased hunger, even though I keep being a skinny fella after being slightly overweight 'till the age of about 6-7.  
I initially didn't think much of it, because I had been living with this thirst and hunger for a long time and I couldn't think of a moment where I ever really noticed any super urgent effects. I do however notice when my blood sugar is low, sometimes completely separate from being hungry, I get pretty weak, can't concentrate, slightly shake and my vision also changes the same way an HDR filter changes a picture.

I recently started thinking about it more and did some research on the symptoms and started to have a growing suspicion that I might have Type 1. I also feel tired most of the time, but this is such a common thing I never really took it seriously.

I decided to take action because my aunt, who has a pretty severe case of Type 1, had her second (extremely) near death experience in a short time while on low blood sugar.

I don't have blurry vision, nor do I pee a lot even though I can easily drink 4 liters in a day, sometimes even 5 liters just by constantly slowly drinking. I guess I just have a big bladder and am good at suppressing the feeling that I need to pee until i absolutely have to.

I'm not really sure what to think, i feel like all these symptoms can be explained by different things, no weight gain can end once I older (Turning 19 in a week, day after the test lol), Drinking a lot doesn't seem to be too difficult if sufficiently spreaded out over the day, large appetite is also a pretty common thing just like being tired, only the feeling of low blood sugar (I assume it's that) is a bit more difficult to explain but I don't seem to have too extreme symptoms.

Any thoughts? Am I reading too much into this or could this very well be a case of Type 1 with milder symptoms of low blood sugar? (if that's even a thing)...

Help please! Travel and Swimming with Diabetes,"Hello! My husband has type 1 diabetes and we've been invited to join my family on a vacation with two flights and TONS of swimming. Currently he uses an insulin pen, a freestyle libre sensor, and a backup finger prick monitor if needed.  


I'd like to gather as much advice as possible for traveling with diabetes and managing blood sugar while on vacation. I'm concerned about his insulin and pen tip needles in the airport/on the flight. I'm also very concerned about how to keep his supplies nearby during the trip. It's a resort with wristband access to everything and tons of water-based activities. As such, we will not be carrying much while we're out because all we need is the wristband and any bags will get wet or need to be left unattended (the last thing we need is his insulin stolen!). Additionally, they make you remove anything that can get dropped for a few of the activities so anything we would take with us would need to be extra secure.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I'm worried about his sensor being exposed to so much water and potentially not being able to carry his receiver much to check it. I'm thinking about trying to wrap up the sensor in something waterproof and to maybe put the receiver in a waterproof pouch.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on the topic is super appreciated and if different supplies are recommended I'm interested in purchasing anything that would make the trip easier for him.

I was wondering if you guys would be willing to answer some questions about having Type 1 diabetes to help me better understand (and write about) what it’s like to live with it. 

I may refer to the answers you give when I write, but I will not quote, cite, or reuse any of the responses to this post. I really am just hoping to increase my personal knowledge in this area, to be sure I’m communicating about Type 1 diabetes in a way that is as honest and accurate as possible. 

Below are my questions - you’re welcome to answer any and all of them, but don’t feel like you have to answer each one! Thanks in advance!

What is it like to live with Type 1 diabetes?

What is a childhood with Type 1 diabetes like?

(For those with insulin pumps) How has having an insulin pump changed your life? What was it like before you had one? 

(For those with continuous glucose monitors) How has having a CGM changed your life? What was it like before you had one?

(For US residents) Do you struggle with issues related to insurance and getting the right medicine and supplies you need (or other insurance-related issues)? If so, would you describe the situation (to the degree you feel comfortable)?

What can those of us without Type 1 diabetes do better when it comes to supporting you?

A little background about DTAF - we purchase continuous glucose monitors (and the supplies needed to maintain/utilize them) for children in the US who are uninsured or underinsured. We don’t have any paid staff or overhead, so we give away 100% of what we get. If you’d like to learn more about us, you can do so here: [https://www.facebook.com/DiabetesTechnologyAdvocacyFoundation/](https://www.facebook.com/DiabetesTechnologyAdvocacyFoundation/)",diabetes_t1,1572278266,tealrunningshoes,12,2,True,2019-10-28
Problem with hands,"I have been having problems with my hands. My fingertips have become very wrinkly and dry, and very sensitive sometimes painful when i hold or touch anything.

Ive seen 5 GPs and none of them know what it is, one said its not typical of neuropathy but it could be.

All the others said they have no idea and think its neuropathy. I did a blood test to check for other signs but they said everything is normal. 

I have to go out of the country for 3 weeks on monday and my brother wants to cancel because he said he doesnt want to go and have something happen and hes left to pick up the pieces and have the hassle of dealing with it. I also dont want to have to put him in that position im just worried because i cant see a neurologist until im back and we cant get a refund for our trip - ive been working 12 hour shifts 6 days a week to save up for it.

What are typical symptoms of neuropathy in the hands for anyone here who has it?

Mine started out feeling like splinters in my fingers then the next day it was dryness and then became wrinkly the next day now it hurts sometimes. I do not feel any numbness or a lack of sensation, if anything i feel like it has become more sensitive.

Software for under 13yr old?,"Trying to find software I can use to help my daughter that was recently diagnosed with type 1 and so far all the physical apps from companies I found out about have turned into web apps, but every time I go to register her so I can upload results and get graphs to help her out, the sites won't let us sign up saying she's too young.

Tried Tilepool which the Endo recommended, but won't let us sign up.  She uses a OneTouch blood meter and their new web app won't let me sign her up either.  Both say she has to be 13.

She's 12 and I want to lie about her birth date just so we can use the services, but I'm thinking in a few months when she does turn 13 I'll end up causing worse issues for her going forward.

Is there any physical apps where I can plug in the OneTouch via USB and get graphs to help us understand her readings that doesn't ask birth date questions?

Wish these services had a ""parent"" signup and login option like how a lot of the online games have that she uses.  Like young kids don't get type 1?

"Frustrated with my 670G, looking for alternatives","I was a relatively early adopted of the 670G and have been using it for about two years now. I'm just about ready to move on. My two gripes are:

1) The main selling point for the 670G is auto mode, and auto mode sucks. This is partially because the sensors suck (see point 2) but also because the correction algorithm used is way too conservative. It's fairly obvious that this was more a proof of concept than a finished product. Setting the target for 120, for me, usually results in me floating around 130-140. During the day I'll turn off auto mode because I have tighter control a manual mode. The only redeeming factor for me has been nighttime control. I've mostly eliminated nighttime highs and lows with the 670G, which alllllmost makes everything else worth it. 

2) The sensors are dogsh*t. Essentially every design aspect is horrible. The sensor is bulky and uncomfortable. The tape leaves so much residue I have to use a f*cking heavy solvent to remove it. The sensor itself is temperamental, doesn't work on half my sites, and has an astronomical fail rate. I'm typing this on night shift and won't have my CGM up and running for another 12 hours because my sensor decided to fail three days early for the second week in a row. I mean, if the accuracy is rancid for the first 24-48 hours then it fails after 96 hours exactly what am I paying for? From what I've read sensor inferiority is a longstanding issue that Medtronic has utterly failed to rectify. 

Bonus point 3) This may just be me, but it seems every time I call Medtronic I get a very polite, very friendly representative... who proceeds to f*ck up my order. Every time. Literally every order this year has required a phone call because it gets hung up in processing somewhere. 

Ok, rant over. Is the G6 sensor actually better than the Gaurdian3? Are there any alternatives to medtronic's auto mode on the horizon? I think I read that the T-slim was going to have essentially an auto-suspend feature added but nothing more sophisticated. 

Are there any better alternatives or are they all as dysfunctional as the 670G?",diabetes_t1,1572156545,-Tazriel,10,3,True,2019-10-27

Type 1 diabetic already using apidra and toujeo and now my doctor has also added Victoza against the information that is available out there. I'm lost and really need guidance.,"I (M 34) have been a type 1 diabetic since 2003. About 5 months ago, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism as well. This is where the trouble begins. Recent tests have shown extreme low vitamin D count along with cholesterol which is through the roof. In the last 5 months, I have switched 3 doctors because I wasn't satisfied with the way they were going. I understand my diabetes is directly associated with my hypothyroidism but I believe my thyroid problem had really fucked me up. I'm at my weakest. It is also important to mention here that I experience 2 to 3 episodes of hypoglycemia on daily basis.

With the latest endocrinologist I went to yesterday, he ignored like previous doctors my hypothyroidism. He focused entirely on my diabetes, and I doubt his approach as well. He added Victoza along with apidra and toujeo. What I have read is, it's neither insulin nor it is suitable for type 1 diabetics. My symptoms of weakness, extreme fatigue and exhaustion continue effecting my job and my private life. Although my TSH is within range now, but the symptoms persist.

So I've managed my diabetes quite badly in the past 4 years (a1c of 10-14) but now I started working out and got a semi closed loop pump.

However, I just tested for ketones out of curiosity and all of a sudden theres ++ levels of ketones. They weren't there a few days ago, not even a few weeks ago.

"T1 with badly controlled blood sugars up until two weeks ago, now having severe stomach issues with blood sugars staying near goal. Is that normal?","I've had some very badly out of control blood sugar levels now for at least a year.  I had lapsed insurance and no way to pay for the insanely priced, but more useful modern insulins, so I've been trying to keep myself alive with over the counter Novalin R and N.  

Finally I have insurance again and have seen a doctor and I'm back on Novolog and Levemir.  My blood sugars have been much better, under 120 most of the time, always under 200, no crazy dips into lows.  Since getting my blood sugar down I've started having severe stomach problems.  The doctor thinks it's gastroparesis.  I didn't have this issue (or any noticeable problems thankfully) when my blood sugar was staying above 200 most of the time, or going crazy low.  Is it normal for your body to rebel after being out of control for a long time?

Long time lurker here. I got diagnosed just under 2 months ago and I've been doing my best to deal, but I've recently started to feel a bit down about the diagnosis for T1. Because it's all so new I've had multiple hospital appointments these last couple of weeks and recently filled out and collected my first prescription for everything I need. Collected it all together and kind of have everything in the corner of my room (bar the insulin which is in the fridge). Still getting the hang of testing BG and getting frustrated at eating my dinners cold or when everyone else is halfway through but that's on me though.

I dunno, I guess I feel a little... almost broken in a way? If that makes sense, as if I cant trust my body to function normally.

Not to mention immortalising the look of stress on my drivers licence for the next couple of years -.-

Any T1D runners out there?

My mom has T1D, and I’ve seen her hit critical lows. It’s the most frightening thing I’ve ever witnessed. I’ve thankfully never needed to be hospitalized (yet) but I am terrified of hitting lows out of fear of what I saw happen to her.

I recently started getting back into running after taking several years off. I just always loved how I felt after a good long run, but it definitely was a love-hate relationship with running. My goal is to run a half marathon by the end of next year. I am currently running 3.0-3.5 miles at the gym with ease after a few weeks of training (yay!) however, usually halfway into my run, my blood sugar starts to drop. And that’s to be expected. But it drops fast, about 3-5 mg/dL per minute per my Dexcom G6. I try to eat something high carb an hour before I go to the gym, but I still end up dipping low very fast and I have to halt my run to down some glucose tabs or gatorade. 

Any T1D runners out there that have advice as to how to prepare for a long distance run so that I don’t have to stop so often to bring my levels back up?

I should mention that I am not on an insulin pump at the moment l. I still make a tiny bit of insulin on my own, so I’ve just been using a Lantus Solostar pen in the mornings and a Humalog KwikPen after meals. And my Dexcom G6, of course.

My T1 Journey since mid July,"
Before I start I just want to say that reading everyone’s posts here and also some of the humour in this sub has been a great support over the last few months :) 

I moved to a new city in April and a bit before that I had been experiencing increasing levels of anxiety. Despite being quite experienced in my field I struggled with my confidence and failed at a few final round interviews to get work. The whole time I had been suffering from the classic symptoms of T1 diabetes with increased thirst, fatigue, waking up at night etc. I went to the doctor and was prescribed sertraline, I had been on this in the past as I have a history of depression/anxiety. As the weeks went on and I started a new job the physical symptoms became overwhelming and I went to the doctor again and asked for a blood test as I thought that rather than anxiety it was a problem with my thyroid (I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 7 years ago). 

The doctor called two days later urging me to go straight to hospital as my blood sugar was very high and that I was diabetic. My A1C was 12.8 and I had regular spikes of up to 31mol! It turns out that the diabetes was hiding behind my anxiety and thyroid problems for years. There has been some nerve damage and a lot of adjustment to my life but I’m responding very well to treatment. My A1C is now 5.4. I’m quite fatigued still as I think my body is adjusting to these lower levels after years of highs.

My social anxiety has receded a bit thanks to my levels stabilising, healthier lifestyle, sertraline and decreased alcohol consumption (I still drink quite a bit sometimes though!) However I have found myself struggling with worry of how damaged my body has become from not being diagnosed sooner. I’m definitely and over thinker and having to constantly think about checking my blood or if I feel alright is wearing me out.

Sorry i'm new to the thread, haven't really done any researching to see if something like this is already on here. But I'm just having an emotional moment and I really don't feel like dragging my family into what i'm feeling right now. 

I hate my diabetes, I hate taking care of it, I hate having to acknowledging it, and I hate myself for not trying to take care of it.

I not only have my endo but a therapist and Psychologist as well trying to help me take care of myself.  I have been given chance after chance, try after try and I continue to let myself and my family down. I've used the pens I've gone onto an insulin pump then abused that and got put back on the pens and earned my way back to an insulin pump, where i've stayed since then.

Sudden random insulin sensitivity,"Here for some ideas... I have actually posted suggestions on posts like this before but of course none of my previous advice is working on me 🙄

For some reason once every 7-14 days I seem to have a day or two when my sugar just absolutely plummets with a small amount of insulin, regardless of what I eat.

Example: yesterday I was having a milder version of this issue so today I gave a few units less basal, and one unit of insulin for breakfast’s big bowl of oatmeal with fruit pouch (45g carb) I’d normally give 2-3 units. Little bit low after.

Lunch today, I took two units for a bowl of soup and pumpkin pie. Had to drink 70g of fast acting sugar over the last 3 hours just to now come out at 90mg/dL and still dropping slowly. Normally 70g sugar Id cover with a good 4-5 units of insulin.

- too much basal
- mistaken dose
- lots of exercise

Keto and t1 for newly diagnosed 12 yo m??,"Hey all. My partners boy (12) has recently been diagnosed with T1. The boys mum, is anti-medicine, anti vax, anti intervention of any kinds Before being diagnosed he was sick for months and it wasn’t until he collapsed that she actually acknowledged that he needed help. He was in critical condition by the time he got to hospital. 

He lives with her full time at the moment, and she won’t give him any insulin. She has him in a strict keto diet and he’s in the honeymoon period at the moment so his levels are good, so it seems to be working.

My partner is anti keto. We followed the plan when we had boy for the holidays but he was perpetually tired and hungry. This is obviously causing tension between them. It’s 100% not my concern, except that he is coming to live with us full time next year and also, I tend to agree with his mum in that diet is very useful as a management tool. However, I imagine as a tool along with insulin. And he’s a growing boy... he seems to need more.

My question is, are there medical resources I can direct my partner to that shows that keto is helpful, or is it indeed a “crock of shit” as he believes. There has to be a middle ground here, one that is not going to be putting boy at risk or confusing him further.",diabetes_t1,1571696794,zabrafinch,5,1,True,2019-10-21

Thing is, lately I've been having lots of low BG levels (I'm still using MDI's with basic insulins, I don't think my current insurance covers fast acting ones, and it definitely doesn't cover pumps and CGM, although I am interested in getting at least the latter) and while I take a spoonful of peanut butter to avoid getting many lows and try to be stable sometimes it doesn't work, plus I know I can't rely on that always

Fun story I did not know could happen with Type 1... Rhabdomyolyosis,"Background: I’m a fairly healthy guy. Tall and very lean, 6’4 and 175 pounds. I run  20k a week. 


As I am writing this up it is from a hospital bed in the intensive care unit. I took insulin for a nothing special meal (sandwich and veggies). Took the insulin on my way home so I was primed to eat when I walked in the door. 20 min later I am standing in front of the fridge and then ....NOTHING. I’m gone. I black out....I assume I then fell on my back on the concrete floor of my Kitchen. I passed out from a low blood sugar. Not a new story yes, we’ve all heard of this happening to people before. 

The next parts are where it gets weird. 

I was completely unconscious with a blood sugar below the 40s according to my continuous Dexcom G6 .....for 6 hours. I woke up  at 3am the next day. When I woke up ....I couldn’t feel anything below my waist. I couldn’t move my legs. I was weak and barely conscious. I managed to eventually pull my body with only my arms to some fruit snacks downed 30g of carbs and just continued laying on my floor until  it kicked in. 

At this point, I thought the legs thing was really weird but I’ll get control back I guess when my sugar is up. Right? No. Sugar was up 20 min later and I was still paralyzed. I was now going delirious from panic. Did a ‘Hey Siri Call...’ to my best friend to calm me down. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I didn’t know how to fix it. I was powerless. I was an athletic runner who couldn’t move his legs anymore. I was screaming in my head. 

He calmed me down and got an ambulance to me. All my doors were locked so I dragged myself to the door with my arms to let them in. They got me to the ER.

It turns out I was suffering a combination of a swollen spine from compaction on a solid floor for 6 hours. The compression in my lower spine shut off innervation of my nerves into my legs. This 6 hours of compaction also compacted all the tissues in my body with contact to the solid ground. This lead to something called Rhabdomyolysis. 

This is the extremely high accumulation of dead cells within the body. The typical person has anywhere between 50-250 u/ml at any time (A Calcium-Klinaise blood panel [CK]) just standing around doing nothing . Athletes can get up to maybe 1,000 u/ml after a strenuous workout. 

Mine clocked in at 79,800 u/ml at the ER. They immediately began to   F L U S H  my body with saline. 400 ml of fluids every hour in the ER. Nuero comes in and tells me the situation, ending it with warning me that I may never walk again. This was all 5 days ago.

I’m still alive. I can wiggle my toes now and have full control over everything but my ankles essentially. The rate of progress would suggest its only a matter of days or hours before I can work them fully. I mostly can now. But not entirely. 

But it doesn’t end there! Remember at the beginning when I said I weigh 175 pounds? That was 5 days ago.  I now 264 pounds. I have a muffin top lol. I’m huge everywhere. My dick got so thick I now have a foreskin again. Turns out they overdid the saline treatment. By a lot. My CK is now in the normal range. My kidneys are above average health. I’m ready to leave. But they pumped so much fluids into me it’s effecting my mobility. My legs are so swollen I cant really move anything easily. 

They admitted to over doing it so now they’re giving me some kind of water pill (diuretic) that will make me lose all of these fluids in 48 hours. 

Ultimately, what I learned to respect from this is that lows are EXTREMELY dangerous. More than I think I took seriously. The cost could be death. Also extremely severe is what you go through if you’re lucky enough to live. 

TLDR; Severe Rhabdomyolysis from passing out from Hypoglycemia. It’s very very bad and the treatment is nearly just as bad.",diabetes_t1,1571596224,TheGayestGaymer,41,166,True,2019-10-20
Boyfriend is underweight and we don’t know what to do.,"Hi, all. I’ve posted here before about my T1D boyfriend. In the past year, he’s had treatment and surgery for retinopathy and was hospitalized for a gastrointestinal thing that isn’t quite solved. This year was a wake-up call for us and we got serious about his health (eating better and a lot less carbs was a big one).

We’ve started working with a nutritionist since he upgraded his pump and got a sensor. She’s been really helpful, but her only advice for gaining weight has been “eat peanut butter.”

"A tale, an insurance policy, and a choice: choose your own adventure","Hi guys. I’m starting a new job next week and my insurance from my current position will be terminating at the end of the month; insurance at the new company will not take effect until the first of the month following 60 days of employment. In this case it will be effective on New Years Day (happy 2020 I guess). Unfortunately this will leave me without insurance for exactly 2 months. 

Currently I have a stockpile of hoarded insulin that could probably last me until doomsday if necessary, so I’m not particularly worried about that. However, I have 13 sensors left with no eligibility for refilling early; 250 test strips testing twice daily (I do have an extra thing of 50 strips but they’re expired); plenty of reservoirs for my pump and three unopened boxes of infusion sets. I also only have a month and a half of birth control, well over 100 days worth of thyroid medication, and only 53 doses of cholesterol medication. 

I will be eligible for COBRA through my current (soon to be previous) employer 2 weeks after my last covered day (middle of November). 

Do I:

A. Drain the majority of my savings paying for cobra for two months in order to only pay minimal copays in case I run out of something?

We have not had that for my 6yo. We check his blood sugar just as much, if not more because were double checking the dex. It’s typically anywhere from 5 to as much as 50 points off, occasionally even more. It’s not just one sensor, it’s all of them. (His sites are on the back of his arms, his endo has us putting them there.) If his blood sugar is moving at all, the Dexcom takes hours sometimes to catch up. They also never last 10 days. Most we’ve gotten is 7. 

It’s frustrating because the only reason my little dude overcame his fear of the dex was because we explained how he wouldn’t have to have so many finger pricks any more, and now we’re actually doing *more*. It’s absolutely unsafe to go by the dex alone. His doctor pushed so hard for it because, in theory, this should be making his life a lot easier, and instead it’s caused a lot of extra stress. Panicking because I can see his blood sugar double arrow dropping on Share, only to contact the school and have his sugar be completely fine even after waiting 20 minutes and rechecking to see if he was going low. Thinking we have to treat a high, only to be glad we didn’t because again, his sugar was almost 100 points lower on his meter and perfectly fine.

Strike 2: the nurse who finally came didn’t seem to understand why I asked for insulin because she said to me, “they already tested your blood sugar an hour ago.  Your sugar was 89 so you don’t need to use your sliding scale.”

Strike 3: I told her I need insulin for the food I was about to eat and she said she didn’t have any orders for mealtime coverage, just the sliding scale. I told her that didn’t make any sense at all, I need insulin if I’m going to eat something. She was very dismissive and kept reassuring me that they would test my blood sugar, as if that would  fix the problem.

Eating in the morning,"Hey guys, 

I was wondering if anyone experienced the same issue in the morning that I have always encountered. Generally, I don’t like to eat in the morning before 11am (unless I get exercise). Before 11 am, no matter the carb content, my sugars rise about 200 once something goes in my Mouth. I have a pump. Generally I’d rather not eat at all than increase my basal rate in the morning. Anytime I inc my basal rate, I also gain weight.

Finally back on track!,"I’ve been struggling with my blood sugar for the past year or two, it has been fluctuating like crazy and my a1c was over 9 a year ago.

5.1 A1C !!!,"My A1C came back today at the endo as a 5.1! To get a low A1C you don’t have to eat a specific diet , cut out certain foods or anything crazy like that - live a normal life! Go eat at Cheesecake Factory, go eat pancakes, go have that milkshake! I do not eat on a low carb diet at all and as you can see, you can still get amazing A1C values. 

Before anyone asks what magic water I drink or how I did this let me give you one word - LOOP.

Loop is a app that connects your CGM and Insulin pump to make them work together. It raises and lowers your basal rate to make your blood sugar level stay at a set number. 

Loop has truly changed my life. I used to always watch my blood sugar levels on my Apple Watch and would get so worked up about them. To be able to live my life without worrying about my blood sugar levels is truly mind blowing. I don’t stress out about it I’m high or if I’m low - I just let loop work it’s magic!

I had been taking a break from the pump for a good chunk of time (almost a year!) I did this for a few different reasons. I was facing a pretty big diabetic burnout and was on the pump for over 10 years. I don't think I was in the right head space to continue using the pump and I went back on MDI.

Now that I'm back in the swing of things I'm contemplating going back on the pump. My BIG reservation is cost. My insurance doesn't pay anything for my pump supplies, and I'm a single mom. I don't make a lot of money and pump supplies are so expensive. Are any of you aware of any kind of savings program/financial assistance for the medtronic pumps?

First week with my Dexcom,"It's been a wild ride. I've had the freestyle libre previously and I didnt really understand how it all worked, since at the time I was only newly diagnosed and I didn't understand a lot of things. The dexcom has become a game changer, there is a huge sense now of accountability and responsibility since I can visually see the affect that carbs have on my glucose. I can virtually see how taking insulin BEFORE a meal actually does keep my sugars steady. Back when I was just testing with my glucometer, you just got a reading at that one time and it really didnt help me understand what was going on inside my body. 

I just today discovered that I share my data with other people so I sent a couple invites to my fiancee and family members (that wanted it) so they can see how it effects me too. Now that they will be able to see my highs and lows as well as my time in target, I am even more motivated to take care of myself so I dont get those bad lows or highs as often. 

As for the equipment, with the job I have I cant exactly have my phone out at my desk (I work in a secure area) so having the receiver on me is actually really nice, I like how I can customize the notification sounds as well, so that its quieter when at work but louder at home when disturbing sounds matter less. I also like how the sensor itself lasts for 10 days because the sticky adhesive only seems to last about that long too before it starts to peel off. 

As for cons, as for most testing materials that dont directly test your blood to get your sugars, it's pretty inaccurate some times. You have to keep the receiver close to you (no further than 20 feet) or it loses signal. Its went off during the night to tell me that I'm low but when I use my glucometer, I'm safely around 110 or so. There is a calibration button you can use to help align it but it still isn't 100% accurate even then.

What all was wrong with you when you were diagnosed?,"Strange subject title, sorry. Just don't know how to word it better. 

I remember shortly before I was diagnosed I had randomly dropped 43lbs, and I had oral thrush and a vaginal (sorry TMI) yeast infection, both of which would not go away, not even after 3 doses of antibiotics.

I thought the weight dropped because the summer had just ended and was thinking ""huh I guess I was more active than I thought I was"". 

With the thrush I thought it came from my asthma medicine, and I just thought I had a really bad vaginal yeast infection, but nothing ""abnormal""??? I guess lol God I was so blind to my sickness.

I wasn't diagnosed with Type 1 until I was 26 years old, but my immune system has always sucked, so I never really over-thought anything. 

The day I finally went to the hospital was because my stomach hurt so bad I was crying in bed for 8 hours. Yes, 8 hours. I didn't go because I looked sick in the face, lost a bunch of weight and had infections that wouldn't go away lol I'm such an idiot. But my stomach hurt so bad that i could feel the pain in my organs, so I finally went to the hospital. 

I'm glad I did finally get out of bed and go to the hospital though. The Doc said I was hours away from a coma.

I feel like I gave myself t1d.,"When I was about 7 years old, there was another girl at my school who had t1d. I was an attentionwhore at that age, and I was majorly jealous of her because I didn't understand what she went through; I just new that my friends were talking to her about her diabetes instead of talking to me like they normally did. I used to pray every single night that I would get something, *anything,* to give me the attention she was getting. About two weeks later, I was diagnosed. I'm no longer christian, but I now strongly believe in the law of attraction and Karma, and looking back on it now, I can't help but feel like I did it to myself; like this is some kind of cosmic karma.

Loopers - describe your rig. What do you like or dislike about it,"I use AndroidAPS with Omnicore. Pump is omnipod, cgm is G5 with xDrip+.

I have a full android standalone watch that runs AndroidAPS, Omnicore and xdrip. I've updated the antenna on my Rileylink and added a wireless charging loop to it along with a custom case. Rileylink lives in my pocket (on whichever side is closest to the pod) 

Nightscout is my source for all data - watch uploads to nightscout when it has WiFi. I use nsclient on my phone to do some loop control. I also have nightscout clients and readers scattered everywhere -  on my work phone, on the menu bar of my computer, etc. I don't have any other people a followers.

What I like: 

1. Obviously the looping is the huge part. I like SMBs in AndroidAPS (small pre bolus plus announcing carbs plus SMB means I pretty much never do a full explicit bolus anymore)

2. Having the loop fully contained on my watch (plus the Rileylink) is very convenient.

3. Nsclient on my phone allows me to see my data on a large screen and easily enter carbs, set temp targets, swap profiles and other loop control. 

4. Nightscout as the source of truth is awesome. I have so much stuff plugged into it. I can't even count the number of ways I view my blood sugar or loop state but they call come from nightscout (I monitor my watch battery though nightscout)



What I don't like:

1.  Omnicore is flakey. There are a number of error states that it can't recover from automatically and it doesn't share its data (like communication history) with nightscout.

2. Watch battery sucks. I have to charge mid day or I risk having zero pump control by dinner time.

3. Full android software was not designed with a 1.4"" 450x450px watch display in mind. Buttons are hard to press and text is tiny. 

4. Nsclient cannot issue remote boluses so I have to use the tiny watch buttons for my pre boluses or when I'm not on WiFi. 




All in all, I give my setup a solid B+ rating with the caveat that there is a lot of potential for improvement.",diabetes_t1,1571025730,RubertVonRubens,1,3,True,2019-10-14
How do you get ahead with T1?,"My wife is a T1, not being a diabetic I never really thought much about this disease before we got together.  When we were dating she was low income and qualified for state provided insurance, but now she is on my employer provided plan.

I feel like I make good money.  I have a computer science degree and work in my field.  We've managed to acquire a couple rental properties by leveraging savings to buy distressed properties and fixing them ourselves, we'll need more capital to do this again and building it feels like it takes forever because more often than not there isn't much left over at the end of the month.  I also make a significant amount of side income trading stock options.  All this together and I feel like most months its all we can do to tread water.  If you looked at our budget it looks like we should be making money hand over fist.  We rarely eat out, our car expenses are minimal, no credit card debt, no student loans, I'll feel like we're doing well and BAM! out of nowhere $600-1000 in medical bills for something related to T1 or its complications.  This month isn't even half over and we've got nearly $700 in medical bills above what insurance covers... last month it was $1200 in the last two weeks.  

Am i missing something or is this pretty typical for people with T1?  How do you guys budget for this?  What do you do to save money on medical expenses.  I'm running out of ideas on how I can try to out earn the expenses here.  I need a way to cut costs.  We will not qualify for any kind of state assistance, but I often feel like i struggle because T1 medical expenses feel like a 2nd (or 3rd) mortgage.  We have 3 kids we're trying to raise and I would like to have something left over at the end of the month so I can do things like save for colleges or take the kids on to the beach.",diabetes_t1,1571026469,ThundaChikin,13,3,True,2019-10-14
Has type 1 diabetes helped you with other aspects of life?,"I just got my first speeding ticket two hours ago. 

But I’m handling it wildly well. I feel like, because  I have type 1 diabetes, I know what’s worth freaking out about and what’s not. I can kind of feel things roll off my back. This is going to be a massive pain and financial hit (my plates were expired and my proof that I did reregister them are two states away bc I’m out of state for college. So that’s not great), but it just is what it is. 

I got caught doing stuff I wasn’t supposed to and now I have to deal with the consequences. It’s almost a relief compared to the unpredictable (and undeserved) nature of T1D. 

I’ve had type 1 for a little over a year, and I feel like I have grown a lot as a person because of it. 

I’m going to be out, I’m estimating, around $350 by the time this is over. And that sucks. And I’m so lucky that my job this summer paid well and my situation is such that it’s a big hit, but not catastrophic. The fun things I was thinking about buying aren’t really things I’m thinking about buying anymore, and I’m definitely eating out way less. But at the end of the day, it’s money. I’ll get more at some point hopefully. It’s not my health. It’s no one I care about. 

And I think this “this sucks.... I gotta deal with this now.... it is what it is” attitude has been largely influenced by seeing the end of my world (my diagnosis) and living beyond it. I gotta see what my new end of the world is (which isn’t this) before I get knocked back again. 

I’m going to also say, I’m a massive hypocrite because I’m not great at keeping perspective all of the time. But a buzz from my CGM lets me know, hey.

Why does the exact same meal affect blood sugar differently sometimes,"There is a grilled chicken sandwich that I order sometimes. Normally if I inject 3 units of insulin 15 minutes before eating it my sugars keep very stable. 

Last night however I got hungry before sleeping (ate too little for dinner), checked my sugars to be OK and had the exact same sandwich 30 minutes before sleeping. Ok whatever, inject 3 units shorty before eating and go to sleep - should be fine right? Nope.

 I saw from my CGM in the morning that my sugars had gone from 83 dL/mg at the time of eating to as low as 54 mg/dL one hour after eating - apparently my insulin pump had turned off the basal before low, but my BSG kept going low and so the pump went off with loud alerts waking up my wife. She panicked and checked that I'm conscious and breathing. I responded with a sleepy grunt and went back to sleep and she stayed up until my sugars started going up shortly after the alert and went back to sleep. Its kind of scary that I don't remember any of this, I was really tired though so maybe I was just sleepy. I remember feeling totally fine and not low just before going to bed. Hate making her worry like this though.

To make it worse I see from my CGM that after 56 low 1 hour after eating my BSG started climbing and peaked at 126 mg/dL five hours after eating (basal was automatically continued many hours before this). Then when I finger picked in the morning it was still too high, at 140 mg/dL. Def felt stuffy and high sugar in the morning and had to walk 30 minutes to shake it off.

Lesson learned don't eat high carb meals too close to bed but my main point is - why did the exact same meal with the exact same amount of insulin affect my blood sugar very differently during the afternoon (very stable sugar during and after eating) and just before sleeping (swings and high sugars many hours after eating, as described above)?",diabetes_t1,1571104751,tyriontargaryen5,8,6,True,2019-10-14

Flying with diabetes,"Ok long story short, I was flying from New Jersey to San Diego with United. When we went to board they said there was no over head space for our bags so they had to be checked. Fast forward to about an hour being on the plane I felt myself having high symptoms. I check my blood sugar and it reads ""HI"" that's it. So I know it's over 600 so I go for my bag under the seat and I can't find my insulin. I start to panic a little and I tell my brother. The guy sitting next to us mentioned that maybe they have insulin in the first aid kit. So I go up to the attendant and ask "" hey do you guys have any insulin?"" And she said yes. I was shocked honestly. She also said a doctor or nurse had to administrate it, when she said that I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I've been diabetic for 13 years, I can give administrate my own god damn insulin. So she gets the first aid kit, turns out there is no insulin in there. Great. The person in front of me happens to have some novolog pens and he so kindly gives me one. Now keep in mind those pens say ""single patient use only."" So they are calling doctors on the ground to determine how much insulin they should give me even though I already told them how much I usually take in this situation. So they finally give me the ok to inject 10 units, literally after an hour of having the insulin available. Literally what I told them I usually do. They monitor me for a little and finally it's 580. So I'm like ""hey, can I take the pen?"" And they said the EMTs will have to decide. So I get off the plane and EMTs are waiting there, keep in mind, I'm completely fine. So I tell them I don't need any assistance but I would like to take the pen with me, considering it will be disposed of and unused. It's the same insulin I use so I didn't see the issue, plus I talked to the guy that have it to me and he said I could keep it. I also offered to pay the co pay of the pen in which he declined. The EMTs would not give me the ok and neither were the flight attendants. So I'm arguing with them back and forth and it was clear they were not going to give it back to me. So I left pissed off.

But there was one thing that always bothered me about her, and kind of had something to do with our eventual break-up, and that was how she handled her diabetes. Within the first week of us sleeping together, I experienced her having hypoglycemia, and having to run to the store to buy sugar, because I didn't have any food at home, and she was suddenly literally blind (that was the only time she said she lost vision.) However, her having hypoglycemia was a frequent occurrence.. like.. almost daily at some point. I would wake up to her alarm going off on her phone, and she wouldn't move for minutes, and remained sleeping. When I'd ask if her blood sugar levels were low, she'd deny it, either annoyed or in a baby voice. If I asked her to check, it would be low, and I'd have to try to get her to take her grape tablets. Well, in a perfect scenario, this is how it would go, but usually what would happen is she would refuse to check her blood, I'd spend 15 minutes convincing her to do it herself, or let me do it, and then spend another half hour pleading with her to take a grape sugar tablet or something.

Things actually got better further into our relationship, but it was always on my mind that she wasn't doing enough to take care of her diabetes. I'd often wonder, at times when she was being especially playful or silly, if her blood sugar levels were off, and it was causing me a lot of stress. The biggest thing for me was that she hadn't gone to the doctor to try to get a cgm or something. Like, to me, I couldn't fathom why she wouldn't want a device that would relieve her from having to prick her fingers all day, and that would guard her from dropping into dangerous levels. It seemed like it would be a huge improvement in her quality of life, and it would help me not have to worry about her diabetes all the time.
But she wasn't being proactive enough about it.. and I just couldn't understand, and it frustrated me. How can I be with someone who doesn't seem interested in having control of a lifelong condition that they have?

So in our last argument, I brought it up, and I said it had been bothering me for the longest time. She got very offended, and said I was being mean and selfish for telling her that her diabetes was a problem in the relationship. I told her it wasn't the diabetes, it was the way she was handling it, but she wasn't listening; she told me I didn't understand what it was like living with diabetes, and that hypoglycemia, and the unpredictable behavior that came with it, was something that would be with her forever, and it was unfair and cruel of me to use it against her.

Anyway, I did some looking around on the web today, and tried to put myself in her shoes - because if I had t1, I'd definitely want a modern cgm and app combination with bells and whistles to minimize my stress and care. But.. unless I'm completely mistaken, the current cgms don't seem as modern as one would expect, and it looks like a lot of people on this sub still prick their fingers, and still have trouble controlling their glucose levels... And it's making me wonder if I was wrong all along, and that a gcm or something wouldn't actually have helped all that much, and that she wasn't being as irresponsible and careless as I thought :(",diabetes_t1,1570937796,n0sugar4u,52,14,True,2019-10-12

Streak of bad novolog?,"Has anyone else been having problems with their novolog going bad recently? It has never happened to me in the five years I’ve been on it until the last three months.

Needless to say I was feeling pretty bad by the end of that week... 

I chalked it up to bad luck. I thought that maybe the town I was in doesn’t have many diabetics or something and maybe it was just a little old or stored improperly. I called novo nordisk and reported the bottles. And now, two months later, I’m feeling like the insulin I’m using is bad again. I have that same sick feeling and my insulin is taking forever to do anything. My blood sugar has been running high for the last few days. So, is anyone else experiencing this?

Where to go from here,"Hi, usually a lurker but I thought I'd speak up... I'm 25F (gender however is non-binary but that shouldn't matter) and was diagnosed the week of Christmas 2005. Right now my A1C level is between 7 and 8, not perfect but surprisingly good considering how badly I manage myself. Thanks depression!

Currently I am using a glucose monitor and the InPen. I used to be on an insulin pump, but after a DKA stay in the hospital, I decided willingly to go back to using an insulin pen. The InPen is good for keeping track of how much insulin I take and when... but since I don't have a CGM, I feel like it's not being utilized fully. I've looked into the Dexcom with my doctor, but when I learned the cost, even with insurance, I quickly backpedaled. I'm on a part time salary, I could never afford one, even with family help.

CGM/pump/patch users. How can I keep the adhesive protected in the shower? Any advice appreciated!,"Here's my current routine;

-clean site 
-apply cgm/infusion set
-apply athletic tape ontop of the cgm/infusion patch (rounding the corners)
-whilst in the shower I basically avoid where I have the cgm because if I shower normally the adhesive detoriates fast. 

I've been with the tandem and dexcom g5 for a few months now and I'm really enjoying the setup.  Everything is solid however as a student  I'm trying to maximize the life of my sensors and infusion sets and the biggest bottleneck is the adhesiveness (esp. from the g5).  I can get the sensor to 30 days but I think the readings would be far more accurate if the cgm were adhered better. By the end the noise of the readings goes to extreme and it looks like a scattered graph with a rough trend. 

(currently brainstorming) Plastic cast sleeves? Plumbing plunger to suction to the site? Tac adhesive before adding the cgm/infusion? 
I'll be sure to try it out if it's worked for you.

Im like ok but if the fucking cgm is failing constantly hows it helping me?

I said well just another dr who isnt listening to me its bullshit. She says its not that were not listening were trying to help. No you arent. But i have to come back in 2 wks.

Different Types of Exercise and It's Affects on BGs.,"I've been a T1 for a long time.  Got my 29th Diaversary coming up in January.  I work in a biology research lab and have a fair knowledge of how the body works and a pretty decent grasp on the whole blood sugar/insulin therapy thing.  I wear a Tandem X2 with G6 and have been pumping for close to 14 years now.  I've had an A1c under 6 for several years now.  I also have a bad knee and exercised-induced asthma, which is why I've mostly avoided cardio.

Despite all this, older age is creeping up on me and I've gained a bit of a gut and not nearly as fit as I once was.  I decided enough was enough and started a daily exercise routine.

That all being said, one thing I've not really gotten the best grasp on is exercise and it's effects on BGs.  

From what I can recall, cardio reduces blood sugar, mostly through increasing insulin sensitivity.  More anaerobic stuff gets the liver involved somehow and can increase BGs.

I've taken a baby steps approach to cardio and have trained my lungs to handle up to 20 minutes of moderate elliptical machine use.  I've also incorporated a bowflex and several should/muscle/chest exercises.  The bowflex is used in the afternoons after I get home from work.  I try not to do too much to avoid the liver glucose dump before dinner.

Morning elliptical use will routinely drop me 30mg/dL.  However...  If I do anaerobic strength warms ups (dips, push ups), my BGs will rise and overcome any cardio BG lowering.  If I skip them, cardio works as normal.

However, from what I remember of basic body metabolism, the body is already primed to be in fat-burning mode after fasting, so I do my morning cardio before eating to try and maximize fat burning.  

So after all that, here's the thing...  If I do strength training warm ups, then my liver dumps glucose, which raises my BG, will cardio burn up the circulating glucose in my blood, or will it still be working towards burning fat?  Should I do my push-ups/chair dips after cardio?

And FWIW, I eat a low-carb/keto diet.",diabetes_t1,1570730787,pheregas,0,1,True,2019-10-10
New level of hypoglycemia awareness achieved,"This is not a serious post...

Last night I came home after my evening workout and went to bed. As usual, my glucose level was slightly increased, but I knew that it will drop during the night. Since I drank a lot of water and Gatorade during the workout I also knew that I will wake up during the night to go to the bathroom; therefore, I will also check my glucose and eat/drink something if the sugar will be low (as it is supposed to be).

To pump or not to pump?,"I am currently a 29F and was diagnosed when I was 15 years old. I have gone through the many phases of burn out and trying to pretend that I was a regular person, but so far I have not caused any major damage.

My endo said that she wants me to be under 6.25 for at least 3 months before we start trying so that my uterus is as close to normal as possible.  

I have been on MDI since my diagnosis because the idea of having a pump freaked me out. I did not want to have a bunch of wires attached to me. I am a clumsy person and I was worried about ripping out a pump site accidentally or having it interfere in the bedroom... I also just did not want to feel or look different. When I got my Dexcom I realized how much better it made my control and that it was worth having something on my body all the time and started changing my mind about a pump. Especially if it made things easier and safer during pregnancy or could help me get to my A1c goals! 

However, I just got my A1c done yesterday and it is 6.1! I was able to get to my goal with my MDIs and now I am back to wondering if it is worth getting a pump.

The kid's a damn liar, and tonight, I'm ridiculously angry, and I don't want to be. Let me explain:

He's had a habit of sneaking food since he was 8. I get it. Kids do stuff they shouldn't. So our response was to give him a little more freedom in making his own food decisions, and showing him how to more carefully figure out his carbs. All was well. But lately, for some reason I can't figure out for the life of me, he just refuses to dose. He's on a pump. It's literally a couple of buttons, and it figures the whole thing out for him. And then he lies about his BG afterward. Tonight, it was a granola bar, WITH THE CARB INFORMATION RIGHT THERE ON THE PACKAGE, that he first lied about eating (which wasn't against the rules, he can eat pretty much whatever he wants, within reason), and then told us his BG at bedtime was 173. I asked him if that's what I'd see if I looked at his meter, and he eventually admitted that he never took a reading. He was at 475. I went back through the logbook on the meter to find that he's ridiculously high at the same time every night. We changed his ratios last week, and they've been pretty dialed in, so I asked him about it, and he told me it's because he's doing the same thing I caught him in tonight. 

I'm pissed the **** off. It's the same conversation over and over and over again. Tonight's issue really got to me, because it literally couldn't have been easier to properly dose for the snack he wanted. 

But I realize I'm angry because I don't have a solution for this nonsense. I've got no idea how to fix it, and I'm not T1 myself, so I'm willing to accept that I don't necessarily get it, but seriously... What... The... Hell??!!

Anybody have any insight? Or maybe you did the same thing at his age, and can explain what was going through your mind when it happened? I can't figure it out, and I can't help him take care of himself if I can't understand the why behind it. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Maybe I needed to vent, idk. But I don't know how else to work this problem, and I'm afraid of what can go wrong.",diabetes_t1,1570593255,Surewhynot62189,24,15,True,2019-10-08
Hopefully switching from Medtronic 670G fo t-slim x2 and Dexcom G6.. how much better is control going to be?,Current A1C is 7.2%... I’m not proud of this. First year in 10 years it’s been over 6%.

Let's be friends,"Hi all,

I wanted to say a few things and share some ideas on how to improve the community. Generally we have been a community mostly for information sharing. That wasn't specifically the goal, it just happened to turn out that way. And I am pretty proud of all of you for the quality of information that is being shared. The average Facebook group is full of bad advice but on here I rarely see misinformation being spread. Our community is generally full of very dedicated T1Ds who really care about their health. I have met many T1Ds in real life but I think I haven't met one yet whose A1C was as low as the average A1C is here. This naturally breeds more complex discussions but maybe we could also use some more friendly and lighthearted discussions.

I noticed that some posts in which people look for friends have been getting a lot of attention. This showed us that the subreddit lacks something to meet people.

Firstly I wanted to ask for opinions on a potential Discord for our subreddit I could set up. The one of /r/diabetes is pretty popular so there is a demand for this. My biggest question is if it would be meaningful to have our own, or if it would turn into a less popular copy of theirs.

The second idea I had was some kind of matching system. People would be able to send a message with some basic information about themselves and they would be put in a group of 2/3/4 people. They then can discuss their day and problems in more personal setting. I am not entirely sure on the details yet but this does require participants who really want to make it work and it only works if those participating are willing to commit to it long term.

If you are interested in these ideas or think that they won't work then please leave a comment.",diabetes_t1,1570446004,Adamantaimai,38,17,True,2019-10-07

"High nights, why?","My daughter is almost 16mths and diagnosed T1 two months ago, on Novorapid and Levemir w/ dexcom G6. I know some patterns with this disease just can’t be explained, but any help would be appreciated. Initially we started off doing Levemir at dinner, which controlled her through the night but not the following afternoon so we switched the Levemir to the morning.. surprise surprise she would drift high at night, with the odd night maybe twice a week she wouldn’t drift. We recently split her Levemir to breakfast and dinner, first few nights were awesome but last night she fell back to old patterns. 5mmol/L when I went to bed at 930, but then drifted to 17mmol/L by 2am, then came down to 13.3 by the time she woke up at 7 am. I believe we are on the right track with her diet, paying attn to GI and fibre content, she isn’t picky (yet) she gets a good amount of vegetables (squash peas broccoli etc). It is frustrating seeing her drift so high after 3 great nights, the previous 3 nights she drifted between 5mmol/L - 6.5mmol/L the whole night. When we try to look for patterns with certain foods or dinners, we can’t pick anything glaring out. A meal that made her drift high one night, didn’t cause her to drift high other nights etc..

Please support - Ride to defeat Type 1 Diabetes (A JDRF event being held across Canada),"Hello Everyone,

Through my employer I am participating in the Sun Life Ride to defeat Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and fund research in Canada  - it's an event organised by JDRF. My team and I will be riding on October 10th at Toronto (Yonge &amp; Dundas Square) at 11 am. It's basically a high-energy stationary cycling event taking place in more than 20 cities across Canada, challenging Canadians to raise funds and go further to defeat diabetes. You can even visit the site on that date to show your support.

Last year the same event raised $3.4 Mill to fund research seeking a cure for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

JDRF who has organised this event is the leading global organization funding T1D research. You can find information about it here - [https://www.jdrf.ca/](https://www.jdrf.ca/)

It's my first time fundraising for anything let alone at such a large event and i admit that I was previously ignorant about T1D. But I read about how type 1 Diabetes is a disease which affects children. My parents and grand parents have what I have learnt is type 2 Diabetes, so I have witnessed the tremendous harm this disease does and it was shocking to find out that children can get the type 1 form of Diabetes.

Being my first time, I set a modest fundraising target of $150. But i really do want to make a difference and hope to raise more than that.

**This is a link to my fundraising page -** [**https://jdrf.akaraisin.com/RevolutionRide2019/MustBeatDiabetes**](https://jdrf.akaraisin.com/RevolutionRide2019/MustBeatDiabetes)

To be honest most of my friends and relatives seem to be unaware about T1D and I am finding it difficult to find people willing to donate.  While most people know a lot about Diabetes itself, I found that very few knew much about T1D (including myself). I found this forum while searching for information on T1D and was hoping that members here who are definitely better educated about T1D would be willing to make a contribution however small. 

I am posting some links below for anyone who would like to know more about this event, how your money is used and about JDRF. Maybe even you could participate.

The FAQ link also provides information on Tax Receipts issued for donations

"I need some advice, and help T1","I just made a reddit account for this because I'm not quite sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 17 right now, and I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 9 years old. For most of the time since then, my control has been fairly well, but once I started high school I got lazy with my management, and began eating a lot of junk food, and even though I gave a lot of insulin to try and compensate for it, my blood sugars obviously fluctuated. For example, in freshman year I had an A1c of 9.7, which was my highest ever, but it went down after I started managing it a little better, but not how I should have. 

  
A few years later, and I'm a high school senior. I've started noticing some months ago that I often feel as if my feet are ""falling asleep"" (tingling), but it usually doesn't last more than a few minutes. Along with this, my memory hasn't been as good and I have a hard time remembering things like character names in a book or movie, even though everyone else around me clearly remembers them. I've brought it up to my parents before, but they were dismissive about my perceived ""brain fog"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Just this morning, I decided to go test my blood sugar at the pharmacy and it was 147/97. because my management has still been bad. I've been waking up high, giving a bunch of insulin and then going low later in the day, and so on. I don't test my blood sugars as much as I should, but that's definitely going to change. I know now that I have to take this especially seriously and that I have to bring it up to my parents and go to the doctor/endocrinologist and get my shit together.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm also worried about is whether my brain fog will improve, or if my blood pressure will ever get down to normal, healthy levels like other kids around me.

Diabetes management with In-Laws,"Hi I’m new to reddit, and have never had a diabetes support network before. I’m hoping to find perspectives from other T1’s on coping  with and managing expectations around Diabetes care with family.

I’ve had T1 for 15 yrs and am married to the kindest most loving and helpful husband. S.O is super great and supportive with T1. He understands it, we eat well, culturally diversely, and life is good. I will add that his parents are kind loving humans who treat me with respect and none of the discussion to come is due to ill intention on their part. Also We are an interracial family. I am culturally Indian and that is it’s own set of separate challenges.

The issues arise when with his parents who are a classic meat and potatoes American family. They eat relatively unhealthy per diabetes standards (lots of pasta, rice, cheese, meat, dairy, not enough non-starchy veg) and it’s been a challenge for me to speak up for my dietary needs. They don’t understand the effort diabetes takes and stress that comes with an unplanned food life. Mostly his dad isn’t interested in discussing food, no curious about my diabetes needs. They live in rural Maine where access to restaurants or other kinds of food is very limited, except for, you got it- classic burger/pizza joints. I have attempted to communicate my needs and assist with meal planning, even cooking meals for the whole family. I’ve tried bringing my own snacks along and requesting they stock the house with healthier snacks (not just crackers, cheese, pretzels, sausages). I feel uncomfortable asking them to adjust their way of life for me, but at the same time dread spending time with them when my FIL mocks my husband and I attempts to eat healthier/lower carb and more vegetarian, meal plan, or any thing else that makes eating with diabetes easier. 

It is stressful enough to manage my dietary requirements on vacation (2-7days) away from home and it’s made worse when their habits are so health wise and culturally different and they don’t recognize or empathize the struggles I face. My MIL is responsible for the food in the family, and she tries to help (buys sugar free ice cream, or low sugar pie for example) but at the end of the day, they enjoy pasta and meat WITH bread on the side. I mostly suck it up and eat what is served, trying to avoid overloading the carbs. It hurts my feelings as if they don’t care enough about my dietary needs, and it extends to me feeling I am uncared for/unloved. 

Is it ok to request to eat separate meals? Or request they modify their diet a little for the few times a year we spend together? This situation is damaging my relationship with them and I am so bitter and resentful. My husband recently brought this up with his parents and they were extremely offended saying I was insulting the way they eat and their way of life. They didn’t at all validate or understand the challenges that come with living and eating with diabetes. It’s extra challenging because they are my in-laws, not my parents, and are not required to love me in the same way. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Feeling unsupported by family? How can I help my in laws understand and care about my diabetes when we are together? Any ideas would be great at this emotionally challenging time.

Went to the urgent care and they sent me to the hospital for CT scan which showed the lymph nodes in my lungs were over 3cm, when they should be 1cm (sorry for those Americans that use the imperial system).

When the Doctor informed me of my new diagnosis, I asked if there was anything I can do to suppress my cough and reduce the pain and swelling in my legs. All that was said is that I just have to toughen it out until I speak with another doctor who might look into putting me on Prednisone, but they don’t recommend that since having diabetes makes the treatment worse than the condition. 
Just seeing if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and what they had to do.

Latte spike!,"Let’s start by saying that I drink an insane amount of black coffee. Drip, americano, espresso, homemade, Fivebucks... tons of it. Six cups a day minimum, and I’ve never had a noticeable BG spike from it.  No milk or sugar, so no carbs and the caffeine doesn’t seem to affect my BG. 

But, drink a latte or a cappuccino and GIANT spike occurs. No sugar, just milk and espresso, and I ride a BG spike for the next four hours.  This morning’s latte sent me from 5.0 to 10.0 in about 20 minutes. My Libre shows the spike, and I feel the spikey sweats so I’m pretty sure it’s real. 

However, a latte has maybe 5 grams of carbs, and that spike should be the result of 50 grams of carbs.  Even more baffling, my BG has gotten back to 5.0 again four hours later - completely on its own. If I had bolused for it, I’d be super low by now. 

Why would 5 grams of carbs act like 50?  Why would my BG come back down on its own?",diabetes_t1,1570209425,bigjilm123,11,2,True,2019-10-04
Sucralose,"Do you have a reaction to sucralose? My BF drank a bang energy drink yesterday, of course it advertises 0 carbs, but it didn’t make any sense to me. He woke up very high for him. So I did a little research, it didn’t take me long to find contradicting information to it’s claims. 

Sucralose website says: 
“Suitable for People with Diabetes

Sucralose is not recognized as sugar or a  carbohydrate by the body. Thus, it has no effect  on glucose utilization, carbohydrate metabolism, the secretion of insulin, or glucose and fructose  absorption. Studies in persons with normal blood  glucose levels and in persons with either type 1 or type  2 diabetes have confirmed that sucralose has no effect on short- or long-term blood glucose control.”

Other outside sources said(here are just 2 of many):
“A study found that sucralose increased blood glucose levels and insulin levels while decreasing insulin sensitivity.5  This could negatively affect people, especially those with diabetes, who consume sucralose to try to manage their blood glucose levels.”
-downtoearth.org

“Researchers who presented new data at ENDO 2018, the 100th annual meeting of the Endocrine Society,1 in Chicago, say artificial sweeteners can promote ''metabolic dysregulation."" If it sounds awful that because it is. Translations: just as sugar creates problems, so it seems do artificial sweeteners by messing up your body's normal response to glucose and insulin, complicate rather than help weight loss efforts, and make you more prone to prediabetes and diabetes, especially if you are currently overweight.”

My A1C has always been in the mid to low 6% range and my bad days probably are nothing to be conplaining about (peaking a 10 or 11 with a few minor lows), but I just feel out of control and its can feel really scary sometimes.

I'm tired of waking up in the morning and checking my blood sugar to see how good/bad of a night it was.

Hba1c too low for a change,"About three years ago I decided to get some sort of control over my diabeetus. Started keto, Omnipod pump and Dexcom CGM. Keto had the biggest role in leveling glucose values and I'm now at a point where my Hba1c is 4.9.

Which, according to my endocrinologist, is too low and she wants it higher. 

Here's my thinking: because of keto and partly because of the CGM, I don't get high or low readings. My last (mild) hypo was well over a year ago. If I was battling hypos or generally low all the time  I'd up my glucose. 4.9 seems like the low end of normal for non diabetics, so why the need to raise it? Especially if my glucose is a straight line throughout the day? I could eat more sugar, getting higher averages but that would cause fluctuations that would definitely land me in hypo-country occasionally which isn't happening now. 

Are there long term issues with staying at low-but-within-normal-range in terms of Hba1c?

My glucose is stable and if I see it slowly dropping I turn off my pump for half an hour. I usually don't have more than 1-2 active units going besides basal, so sudden drops in glucose basically doesn't happen. 

I believe her main concern was hypos and potentially issues with diabetic unawareness to hypos from being hypo all the time, which again, doesn't happen. Unawareness that I already have, hence the CGM, so... should I just ignore this one?",diabetes_t1,1570093456,SneakyNewton,14,5,True,2019-10-03
Excessive Sweating. Like Flooding,"How many of you have such problem??? I would be happy if other type 1 would just post a reply ''me'' or whatever even if you have nothing more to add.

&amp;#x200B;

I am type 1 for 22 years since the age of 13. Never ever was sweating excessively, was like an average person. This excessive sweating started about 7-8 years ago. I had started to use Lantus and Humalog back then recently (maybe it's just a coincidence though). Ok, had also some time under a lot of stress.

Fast Forward: Today I do exercise a lot. I also live in very warm climate (originally Northerner), but my sweating patterns are insane!!! I have talked to my physician some years ago, she just suggested me some liquid to treat skin, it did not help. I went to dermatologist, he also prescribed me something that did not help. Eventually I talked with an endo at the hospital who deals with diabetics. Well, she was also very old school, and the answer basically was: we all sweat. Nevertheless, at the very end she kinda mentioned something that there have been several cases like that recently (so again, could it really be insulin?).

This sweat is coming out of all my pores - face, arms, legs, back, chest etc. As a matter of fact, it's more like simply water, it does not even have any smell or taste of sweat when it drips from my face into my mouth or eyes, lol. 

My workouts are intense, but after each workout I literally lose 4lbs even though I do hydrate. My blood tests do not show signs of dehydration. They showed it only once when I had recently moved to this warm climate and was not used to drinking more water. 

I am not exaggerating even a bit when I say that I look like I have just walked out of the pool when exercising - it drips from everywhere, my clothes are wet, a poodle forms under my feet within minutes if I stand in one spot. Plus, due to this sweating I cannot even unlock my phone to measure my glucose, I have lost like 5 Libre sensors because they fall off or turn bad due to my sweating. I tape them, even that stupid tape eventually slides end drops off with all the sensor. Sensor itself falls off during the first hour of my workout. 

It also makes me uncomfortable. For the most part, I am not sensitive type of person who will get depressed/offended if someone makes remarks about my sweating (and, yeah, some people with lack of emotional intelligence have already expressed that), but it just annoys me and drives me crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

So again, **does anyone have something similar? Maybe someone has some article explaining this, how it's related to diabetes? Could it be insulin (to be fair, I have not tried changing insulin, only had Basaglar instead of Lantus for a while, still the same)? Or simply, is there solution what to do???????**",diabetes_t1,1570109547,artursau,17,5,True,2019-10-03

Inaccurate Libre sensors,"Hey! I am pretty sure I saw similar post recently but had no time to read it then and now I cannot find it anymore.

Below is a screenshot of my recent Libre sensor readings chart.

1. What does that clock symbol mean, indicate?
2. There are such ''interruptions'' in the chart almost everyday now. Sometimes sensors says that I should try reading glucose 10 minutes later, but in some other cases sensor provides glucose readings - they just later ''disappear'' from the chart like there was sensor malfunction ''try after 10 minutes'' thing again. 
3. Chart does not correspond to readings in numbers. For example, the first peak slightly above 200. One reading said 300 and increasing dramatically. So why there is no peak above 300 there? There are many episodes like this. plus....
4. ...plus, these readings and charts are wrong! I mean, if I had 400, I would feel it, I was feeling fine, and when I measured with a test strip, my glucose was only 186 (which may be true since it was after my workout and I just had had carb load which was still processed with my previous shot due to high sensitivity to insulin that I have with my current workout schedule. The same applies to low glucoses too. Tonight I kinda had Lo for 3 hours. If I really had had it, I would have headache and be puking right now for the whole day. My body has no exceptions to such Lo cases.

So basically, it feels like sensor is dramatically inaccurate and fluctuating with its readings. I must admit, yes, my glucose levels fluctuate more right now due to a new workout regimen and daily schedules context, but it seems like Libre sensor exaggerates every reading outside range from \~60-160 by 200-300%.

Of course, I will contact them if this persists. Nevertheless, I must admit, that maybe my sensor is affected by my sweating? I have wrapped tape around it, otherwise it may fall off during my exercises when I sweat out like a gallon of water every day. What are others's experiences? I am not complaining here, just wanted to share my recent experience and see what others have to say since I remember seeing some similar post a few days ago.

Taking flagyl (metronidazole) really messes with my blood sugar control,"I have been googling about this and found little information so i wanted to put it out there in case anyone else has similar experiences. This is the 2nd time I have taken metronidazole afetr my T1DM diagnosis. The first time, I noticed my sugar levels kept dropping and i would need to snack on a fair amount of sugar tablets each day to keep my blood glucose above 4-5mmol. This stopped after I finished the course. This time, I noticed my sugar levels were very resilient in staying above 10mmol (I maintain 5-7mmol) despite huge boluses of insulin via my insulin pump. I changed my cannula site, changed my insulin supply, nothing helped. I also had an upset bowels (discomfort, increased bowel motions and slightly loose but not watery). I started metronidazole this time for what I thought was an infection in my bowels. My blood sugars dropped immediately within a day and my bowels got better so I was convinced the infection was causing the resistant blood sugars, even though it must have been a mild infection (I've had serious traveller's diarrhoea and this was nothing in comparison). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, now I will still get highs (13mmol) and then suddenly drop low (4.5mmol) a few hours after a meal (where I took a normal correction dose) which needs me taking sugar tablets to stop the drop, and then have dinner to suddenly find my sugars increasing to 13mmol+ 30 minutes to 1h after finishing eating (but not after taking the sugar tablets!). This yo-yo effect has been crazy and only happening over the last week. The worst part is, I do not always get this drop after a correction dose so I really could not explain this yo-yo effect and think it can only be due to the metronidazole.

Explanation for high blood sugar,"For the last week's, I had almost the same routine every day. Eat the same thing for breakfast every day except one, at the same time, skip lunch every time and I had a class on the weekdays. Every time I enter the classroom, my blood glucose level shoots up to 200 and only goes down after I leave, but then I drop really low. On the days without the class, I stay normal. It's the same breakfast and lunch routine, so it's neither what I ate nor my basal rate. I would understand going low, because I walk to class but high?

The one day I skipped breakfast, my levels also be went high. But not on the weekend.

I'm just so confused. Sorry if I did any English mistakes, it's not my native language and I'm low atm",diabetes_t1,1569942782,DarthVaderin,8,2,True,2019-10-01
Guardian 3 sensors suck!,Sorry for this vent yall. Just had to do it somewhere where i know ppl will understand. So i just a long drawn out arguememt qith medtronic and the guy sounded anything but Sympathetic. We have had to replace 5 yup 5 fucking sensors in the last 2 wks due to being defective!  Ok each time we have to replace one we have to put another needle in my body and im over it. Im about to chuck the fucking thing out the window. But of course getting dexcom is impossible cause i can not by any means afford that outta pocket. Bless those of you who have to or can cause i dont know how yall do it. We just cant afford it.

Starting to Give Up,"I don't think I'm ready to admit this to any of the people in my life yet, so I decided to start with reddit.

I'm a 24 year old girl, was diagnosed with TD1 about 4 years ago, Canadian. I'm a full-time student and work about 24 hours a week on top of that. Last February I was hospitalized for Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and found out I also have Hypoparathyroidism. Just some backstory.

I honestly feel like nothing works when it comes to TD1. My lifestyle right now is so busy that I don't have time to meal prep, or dedicate hours to my diet and my health. I barely afford my rent on how much I am working right now, so I often skip insulin so that I won't have to buy more as soon.

I've lost about 50 pounds since my initial diagnosis, and my weight goes down every time I check. In June, I was sitting at 140. I'm now sitting around 133. I'm getting awful leg cramps at night, to the point where I feel like losing my feet is inevitable. When I'm not at school, work, or doing homework, I'm laying on my couch half-asleep because I'm always exhausted. I get up in the middle of the night several times to use the bathroom, if I fall asleep at all.

The fact of the matter is, I'm severely depressed and I don't know what to do. My depression makes me stop giving a shit about my health, and my poor health makes me more depressed. My father had T1D and killed himself when I was five. I used to not understand it, but I've been coming to see his point a lot lately. I'm starting to get worried that I'm going to snap one day after a bad diabetic episode and follow in his footsteps.

I don't have the time or money to properly control this disease. I feel like I'm fighting a battle that I've already lost. I really just don't know how to get my shit together.

So, after some excellent advice &amp; assistance from you lovely people, I seem to have gotten my overnight highs under control. Waking up with ""normal"" fasting BG (100-130) has shed some light on the fact that I have no earthly idea what I'm doing...

So, I have a 1:7 carb to insulin ration, and a 1:30 correction. I KNOW that a high fat or high protein meal delays the sugar spike. My question is for how long? Logically I know that it will vary person to person and meal to meal, but is there a way to estimate?

I got so stuck on the fact that I was told at first diagnosis to inject Novolog 10-15 minutes prior to eating (no sooner, no later) that I've been missing the pretty significant spikes that come after a meal. 

I notice that I tend to spike about 4 hours after a higher fat meal. So..how do I do the Novolog? Take the normal amount when I eat &amp; then correct for the spike? Delay the injection until 3 hours post meal? 1/2 &amp; 1/2? Help!!",diabetes_t1,1569854738,terrim24,5,3,True,2019-09-30

My insulin may as well be water,"**Background info:**

* Male, 37 yrs old, diagnosed in 1996
* Last A1C was 50 (6.7% in old money)
* On injections, not pump (NovoRapid and Tresiba)
* UK based, hence the numbers below!
* Office based job, but not stressful, and no major changes at home that I think could be causing it
* Fairly active (run around 20-30 miles per week)

I'm ***so*** frustrated!!! For the past 4 days I've been running high BGs (rarely falling below 9 mmol/l) and nothing I'm doing seems to be bringing it down.

I have a Freestyle Libre so I can keep an eye on patterns and trends, as well as a MiaoMiao (using xDrip+) and I can't work out what is different from usual. My glucose reading on my Libre seems to jump around a bit (over the course of 3-4 readings it could jump by 1-2 mmol and fall by the same amount) but I have been testing my blood as well and the readings between the two are pretty damn close.

* I'm halfway through a cartridge of NovoRapid, so the insulin hasn't changed (nor has it been exposed to high/low temperatures and it is well within its expiry date). A 300u cartridge of NovoRapid would normally last me about a week to a week and a half
* Same as above with my basal Tresiba insulin, except for the cartridge usage length
* I'm as active as I normally am (running 3-4 times per week, and a 15-20 minute walk about an hour after a meal)
* I'm eating the same foods and meals that I typically do
* I'm carb counting everything as I normally do and I'm confident I have the calculations correct
* I normally operate around a I:C ratio of 1:12 to 1:15 but right now I'm nearer 1:5 and it still isn't enough to bring my BG levels down
* My ISF is about 1u for 2.5 mmol/l

At night it's even worse - I injected 5 units a couple of nights ago as correction before bed and it did nothing. I went to bed with a reading of 9.7 mmol/l (blood, not from the Libre) and because I could see the rising trend, I injected. I still woke up with a reading of 19 mmol/l

For dinner last night, I only had 30 grams of carbs, yet I needed to inject 5u for the food, plus a little extra as correction, and it still didn't bring me into range. Just to deal with last night's 30g I took a total of 9.5u, split over several hours (eat/inject around 7pm, still giving myself correct doses until 1am and still waking up high)

Lunch today, I ate 80g of carbs, and because I was still running high (despite another 3 units of NovoRapid when I woke up doing nothing) I took 9 units and still ended up with a reading of 19.5 mmol, 3 hours after lunch! A 30 minute walk brought me back down to 9.3 mmol, but now it is rising again despite no food passing my lips! Another 3u injected as a correction, and an hour later, nothing is yet happening - I'm holding steady at 11.6 mmol/l

I don't really know what I'm asking for here. I just need to vent and get the frustration of the last few days out of my system, but if you have any suggestions on what else I can try, please please share!

 I feel like crap - it's like before I was diagnosed; tired, thirsty, peeing a lot. Its like I've become super insulin resistant overnight.

How does Long acting insulin work?,"I am a recently diagnosed T1D a month ago ( during DKA :) ) and ever since i ve been taking Levemir FlexTouch Pen ( 35 units in morning ) and humalog before meals ( based on carb count usually 6 to 8 units ). 

The results are awesome as it is less than 180 most of the time during day but have to deal with some minor lows. But the issue is my fasting blood sugar is constantly 180 to 190 which I know is pretty high. Even though i eat my dinner around 7 30 PM and check my BG around 10 PM  it is around 130. But i ve no idea how it just increases around early morning. 

Just saw my ENDO and discussed this issue today and she told Levemir works only around 18 hours and thats why my BG starts peaking after that. She changed my Levemir to Basaglar. Still I am having two pens of Levemir left she told to take two shots one in morning and one at night of 19 units each until i switch to basaglar. 

So I started studying about how long acting Insulin works which i found has a protein coating which slowly breaks down over time which supplies our blood a constant amount of insulin. 

I am going to split my dosage tomorrow and my question is 

&amp;#x200B;

* Doesn't it affect the amount of insulin supplied per hour as i take only 19 units every 12 hours. 
* Will it affect my rapid acting Insulin to Carb ratio which I have before meals.

We eventually stopped seeing each other, and I can't help but think a lot about the idea of having children who can inherit T1D being a scary prospect especially to those who are not so informed about the condition.

A few tips and other little details about life and alike that I have accumulated.,"Firstly, I just wanted to say. With dexcom share, the apps are different between North America and the EEA, and a simple vpn will work with addressing European infromation protection laws. Yes it sucks its like that, but it just is like that. Learned from experience.

Secondly, I can not emphasize how important it is for, especially youth, to get outside of toxic environments with t1d. This can be either by people laughing or making jokes, or people getting overly involved by trying to “support” you. Please, please let me know if you have these sorts of problems. Right now, I got out of a really bad situation a couple months ago where people were trying to over manage me at school diabetes wise, and it made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, because, you know, its my body. You should not have to justify this discomfort to anyone else, Do whatever you must, but your mental health is a really important part towards caring for your diabetes, because if you can’t control that you will burn out.

Thirdly, you don’t need strangers or others to validate how you eat, or what your a1c is. Thats between you and your doctor, and if they don’t like that, then they shouldn’t interact with you.

Fourthly, make it clear to everyone who knows you have type 1 that unsolicited medical advice not to just us, but to anyone with any chronic illness or disability is _not ok_, because it makes us internally discredit the work and care we put in to caring for ourselves and our bodies.

I'm at a total loss. There a pic in the link above.

Then around 21:00 took sugars (marker 3)  they were up so took more insulin (10 units). Then around midnight checked again and they were even higher, so took even more insulin (10 units).

Need a lot of dental work...,"Hi Everyone

I've been in a terrible position over the past few years, some of it a result of being Type 1 and some of it where being Type 1 just hasn't helped.
For 18 months I was suffering from Gastroparesis. This affected me being able to eat/keep food down and i was being sick about 5 times a day and dropped down to my skeletal frame.
On top of this i was in a job where no accommodations were made/allowed and as a result my glucose management  and health and well being suffered dramatically. I was in a very dark place.
Recently I have been trying to take back control of my life. I am two days away from leaving my current job and putting that ordeal behind me.
I'm in the UK and I have managed to get a CGM, it gets fitted in a month and it will enable me to really take a hold of my glucose levels.
My new job will pay me far more, which I plan to invest in myself - gym membership etc.
The thing is, all this poor glucose management and throwing up has left my teeth in a horrendous state. I mean horrendous. I'm finally in a position do something about it.

Please feel free to share your own experiences or provide useful information about the relationship between alcohol and hypoglycemia. Here are the  questions:

* As a type 1 diabetic, have you ever experienced a sever case of hypoglycemia from alcohol? Were you hospitalized or at risk of possibly dying?
* Can you specify how much you drank and how quickly your blood sugar dropped after the first drink?
* What were your symptoms like during the experience? Did you ever loose consciousness or have seizures?
* What is the likelihood of someone with 1 diabetes going into diabetic shock from alcohol? Do most diabetics stay away from alcohol, or is drinking in moderation acceptable?

I am confused with that, when I check my blood glucose with my freestyle libre I get the reading but it also shows me a graph of how my BG had been behaving up until that reading.

He then replied ""Ok, I am now going to contact your GP for proof that you were checking 8 times a day"" i then asked how he would know that from my GP and he then said ""by the prescriptions they give you"".

While it's hard to see these images and hear the dramatic responses re needles, it's also a little funny to me because IMO the needles/shots are nowhere near the hardest part of living with this disease.

The greater struggles are difficult to capture by photo and are not highlighted in the minds of our peers. But we know what they are:

-The time and effort spent with insurance companies, pharmacies, etc. just to secure the necessary supplies to live. Then having to do it all over again every month, quarter, or any time we switch jobs/insurance. 

-The thousands of dollars spent every year on medical expenses that we'd rather put towards a vacation, or really on anything else.

-Never being able to enjoy food or excersise the same way. 

-The mental exhaustion of having to track and manage blood sugar; knowing there will never be a day off. 

-Moments sidelined while waiting for a low to rise. 

-Stubborn highs and feeling sick while worrying DKA may land us in the hospital. 

-Feeling ""different"" from our healthy peers

So we replace it. Well tonight we get a notification saying sensor needed to be replaced!!! What the hell?! We are about to blow through 20 days of supplies in less than a week!! 

Overall we are so happy to be on the sensor now, but the Dexcom system falls short in some areas. For example, if she gets out of range of her sensor it takes like 5 to 10 minutes for it to begin reading again.

Level 2 unlocked... Got switched to Humalog in pens.,"Recently diagnosed in early July (44/M). At that first appointment I asked about pens and was told that because of cost, vials and syringes is standard unless I showed difficulty in using needles. So imagine my surprise when the first day I go to get my Insulin I am told it will be  $700 for a 3 month supply! So I only bought 1 months supply at that time. Some may recall my post a while back showing the 2/3 of my first months supply that should be  ""tossed"".  I went with the rules and stopped using my first supply at 28 days. I still hadn't met with the Endo doc yet so I wanted to do everything by the book. I am now on my 2nd batch and have pushed the 28 day rule by a few days so far. From advice from many it seems there isn't too much harm to extend the time as long as you watch your #'s close. I'm not on a GCM yet, still just doing finger pokes, but I track all my readings and meals on a google spreadsheet. I met with my Endo doc a few weeks ago and one thing that came up was the cost I'm facing and how much I'm supposed to waste. So my doc suggested to switch me to pens so my insulin would stretch out. I'm currently taking somewhere between 6-10 units of Humalog a day. My new pen prescription was written to use up to 50 units per day so I have 5 pens now. The vial was around $95, but I effectively only use 1/3 of it, maybe less. The pens were about $150 for the 5. Now I just need to see if they can do this for my Lantus (13 units at night).

UK pumpers on the NHS - did you experience this?,"I recently had an appointment with a pump specialist to see if I could start using an insulin pump. I've been diabetic for nearly 10 years and have always used insulin pens, but I got referred for a pump because I really struggle with dawn phenomenon, and in general my BS levels are pretty bad.

So, the specialist said that I can get a pump and that I must choose between two options (she narrowed it down for me based on the fact that I use Freestyle Libre, and I was ok with that). She told me that once I make a choice, I have to stick with it for 4 years because that's how long the insurance on it lasts. Fine. I'm a little nervous about making that choice but it's fine.

The bit that really bothered me was that she turned very serious and told me about how much money this was going to cost the NHS. I think she said it would be around £12,000 ""JUST for you"" and gave me a stern look. I really didn't know what to say back to this. I felt like telling them to forget about it, I'll just stay on pens. But why should I? I pay taxes, I'm entitled to what the NHS can offer. I'm really struggling and it's not getting any better, and I think a pump could change my life.

I just want to know if anyone else got this same speech when they first got their pump? 

I'm wondering if it's something they have to do, like how they send loads of appointment reminders and say how much it costs the NHS when people don't turn up. I just think it was kind of harsh and it made me feel really guilty.",diabetes_t1,1569329185,deads0uls,13,4,True,2019-09-24

Just a little update for those that helped me a while back.,"Hey guys, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/6e4nbe/tips_for_dating_someone_with_type_1_diabetes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) here a while back asking for some advice on dating a type 1 diabetic. 

Firstly, I’d just like to thank all who replied with the great advice. Your words, combined with hers, have made for a very smooth and successful learning curve for me. I do her night time shot every single night before bed,  I’ve accumulated numerous “tells” when she’s low or getting there allowing me to act quickly (and discretely in public) to get her something to bring it back up. Hell, I often know it before she does! We recently bought a house together and I do all of the cooking as I’m home much earlier than she is, and I count every carb and portion everything out as precisely as possible. 

I can’t help but think that the replies from my last post had a fundamental part in the success of our relationship. So thank you from the bottom of my heart, r/diabetes_t1! Y’all are the real MVPs!",diabetes_t1,1569348950,mf_miller,4,24,True,2019-09-24

Dexcom G6 Fails and Gripes,"Time to list some grievances Dexcom,

First I wanted to see if anyone else seems to have issues with the G6 after about 7 days of use? I have been having problems since I switched over to the G6 over a year ago. After day 7 I get a lot of disconnects and inaccurate reads. Every time this happens I get to go through the fun tech support line, give them all the information and get a replacement. Its starting to wear down on me since this happens about every 3rd sensor I use. Also the past 2 sensors I have used have failed instantly claiming I can't reuse them saying I have already worn them for 10 days. Ugh.

Also now my insurance only allows Dexcom to send me only 1 month supply. This month sensor one and three failed and sensor two lasted 7 days. I am now currently out of sensors since the last one failed on me while I'm wait for the replacement. This whole process is getting frustrating.

One final gripe is that when I went to reorder my supplies last time I got sent over to a call center not in the US. They guaranteed my order by a certain date and as that delivery day came I was still without the supplies. I called them again, same call center, no sign of my order. I reordered which yielded to still a no show. Finally a woman from the San Diego office called me and straightened it all out. But this stress aint good to have.

Overnight/morning highs,"This is my first time ever posting on reddit, so apologies if I screw this up. 

As background, I'm 45 years old, female. I was diagnosed T1D 3 years ago when I was admitted to ICU in DKA with BG over 1200 (due in part to the incompetence of my then-PCP, who after routine bloodwork showed a fasting BG of 358, put me on metformin &amp; sent me home, did not have me monitor my BG at all, and then ignored me when I called three days later to say I couldn't walk up a flight of stairs. But that's a different story for another day). My last A1C was 6.9%. What I don't have is an outside support system. My family, many of whom work in the medical field &amp; therefore fancy themselves experts, are of the ""there's no difference between Type 1 &amp; Type 2"" variety. They assume that it's my ""fault"" that I'm diabetic because I'm fat (which, to be fair, I am) and judge literally everything I eat. 

To avoid writing a novel here - I'll start with one question. I'm having an issue with overnight highs. As an example, last night I went to bed at 11 with a BG off 99. I have a CGM (Dexcom 6). I woke at around 230 to use the bathroom &amp; my BG was 202. Injected 3 units of Novolog (I use Novolog with a 1:7 carb to insulin ratio &amp; a 1:30 over 100 correction factor. 28 units of Tresiba 1x daily). When I got up for the day at 530 my BG was 199. I dropped to 160 over the course of the next hour &amp; was back up to 200 by 730 am. It's dropped to 169 now (2 hours post breakfast - 13 g carbs). I suspect that by the time I eat lunch in an hour or it will be steady somewhere between 110-130. 
This is an absolutely typical overnight/morning for me &amp; I can't figure out what to do to stop it. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat for dinner the night before, or what my BG is when I go to bed. 

Pump is not currently an option for me. My endo doesn't seem to think I have too much room to raise my Tresiba amount. I'm just at a loss &amp; I'm frustrated &amp; I feel like I'm going to suffer allll the consequences if I don't figure this out. Anyone? Ideas? Suggestions?

Tips for controlling blood sugar levels? Thoughts on going on insulin pump even though A1Cs are high?,"Hi! 
For the first 2 years I had T1D, I managed my blood sugars really well. Then, the past 3 years I started rationing my insulin and using expired insulin (because of this irrational fear I had) and my blood sugar levels and A1C levels were horrible (blood sugar levels mostly above 250). I recently started to fix that bad habit and am now using non-expired insulin. My A1C went from 10% to 8% but I still have trouble with controlling my blood sugar levels. 
My diabetes nurse keeps telling me to fix my diet and eat less carbs and that I can’t carb count correctly, but I’m sure I can unless it’s foods that I’ve never eaten before (which I try my best to carb count for them)...but if I’m told to eat less carbs, I get stressed and then after a while of maintaining a low carb diet, I suddenly binge on cookies, etc. 
I also REALLY want to start on an insulin pump because I am Exhausted from always injecting myself with the pen sooo many times daily. 
My blood sugar levels are getting better, usually under 200. Sometimes due to circumstances such as being outside, I don’t take my insulin which cause my blood sugar levels to rise over 300, but I correct it later. 
My diabetes nurse tells me that he doesn’t want me to start on an insulin pump because I’m not good with managing my blood sugars and my carb counting. 

Do you think I should put off getting the insulin pump until I perfect my blood sugars?

Is my body absorbing sugar without injecting insulin?,"This year I've begun to get into Ultramarathons, with yesterday being my latest attempt at 40miles, unfortunately ending in a DNF when I ran out of steam and missed a checkpoint time cut off. 

I managed my blood sugars by lowering background insulin the evening before and taking reduced quick acting for my breakfast before my run. I then took high sugar gels regularly throughout my run to keep my levels up at around 12mmol over the next 5 hours or so. I felt really low on energy and quite sick whilst running yesterday, maybe this was down to exhaustion or my blood sugars, I'm not quite sure?

So, this feels like a silly question and definitely something I should have my head around as T1 of 5+ years. I did not take insulin for the energy gels because the running was slowly bringing my BGs down BUT does this mean that this sugar was not being taken from my blood into cells without the injected insulin been present? And in turn does this mean that these high sugar gels are not providing the energy boost I'm after?

Help with T1 husband who doesn’t want CGM...,"Hi, I’ve been w my husband for 4.5 years, married 1. We are planning on starting to try for a baby in the spring (waiting for a certain amount of savings). We are both 29.

He has t1 diabetes diagnosed at 14. He self manages it pretty well from what I can see because he’s never gotten really sick in the years I’ve known him (a handful of times he has had a bad high and thrown up— 2 times in almost 5 years, idk if that’s a lot or a little) but literally never goes to the doctor. He grew up pretty poor, no insurance as a kid, and so forth..  no pumps or sensors, just measures his sugar w the little paper strip once or twice a day and takes insulin when he eats.

Originally when we met he said a CGM was something he wanted eventually (when we had enough income to afford it as his work insurance at the time was atrocious and we were poor). Now we have enough and he recently told me he doesn’t want one after all because he manages his sugar fine and “always wakes up if he gets a low overnight.” Which hasn’t happened much in the past year or so but when we first started dating it happened multiple times a week. 

My take is sure, he always wakes up... until one day he won’t????? My aunt who was T1 also died in her sleep from hypoglycemia two years ago, though she was a lot less healthy than my husband. She did not have a cgm. 

I feel like if we are going to have a family (which we both want badly), this is non negotiable for me. 

I’m not sure if I am crossing the line by saying that to him since it’s his body and I don’t know what it’s like to live with this illness which is why I’m posting here. But I love him more than anything and if I lost him... ugh I can’t even think about it. And dying in your sleep from a low when we can afford a device that will literally sound an alarm seems... just, i can’t fathom why he doesn’t want one anymore. 

What do you guys think? Is it unreasonable for me to request him to get this? Is it more effort and discomfort than im picturing? Or do you feel that if we can afford it it’s the best choice to manage t1d? 

I am obviously going to talk a lot more with him about this to see why the change of heart but wanted to get some outside opinions to see if I’m approaching it poorly with him first. 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",diabetes_t1,1569064352,t1husband,17,7,True,2019-09-21
Over a year since I was diagnosed with t1 and I only had 2 lows. Is it normal?,"However, I am almost constantly high... When I was admitted into the hospital the doctors just kinda randomly gave me some doses trying to figure out how much I need. That’s when I had my first low.

Interesting Endo Visit,"First - lowest A1C for me ever 5.7! 
Second - a really good conversation with my endo about those stubborn, temporary high BGs where I tend to overcorrect and then drop fast. He said basically - stop worrying about those temporary spikes, they aren’t damaging.  Bolus, walk, drink water, fast, but stop over correcting. 
Third - I complained that my weight loss is slowing and I want to restart it (I had wls earlier this summer). I complained that I’m losing weight everywhere except my stomach and I read that it was the insulin that promotes weight gain there. He said something like “As you lose weight and take less insulin, you’ll lose that too.” I said “but if I am not losing weight, that can’t happen - sort of the ‘chicken and the egg’ dilemma.” We were at a standoff, lol. So he said “ok, your A1C is great so I’m ok with you reducing your basal by .1 for each time period. Then if you run higher, increase your exercise and water to see if you can get it down without more insulin. That should help and will increase your A1C a bit but you have some room.”

Called them Monday and it turns out they had an issue with the insurance company but never bothered to call me, just let the order sit there. Lovely.

Problem resolved, new shipment to arrive this coming Monday.

Meanwhile I used the last of my normal 90° infusion sets, and I had to put in a 30° one (which I really don't like) last night. Actually 2 as the first one was obviously not in at enough of an angle--it was just under the skin.

Woke up 6:30 this morning to a BG of 222. I'm usually high 70s, low 80s fasting. Odd, but figured maybe I misjudged dinner, or sometimes different infusion sets cam impact absorption, etc. Feel fine, BG is not *crazy* high, no big deal. Correction/food bolus, wait, coffee/breakfast, Reddit... and suddenly I'm over 400. Check infusion set and the adhesive fabric is noticeably wet where the cannula goes in.

Pull the set, put in yet another one, take a guess at how much insulin I *didn't* get and bolus again. Check ketones, and riding that train too, to the tune of moderate. So... downing water like crazy, stuck at home for hours watching my CGM because I have no idea how close I got to the amount of insulin I actually need, and I only have one (demonstrably unreliable) infusion set left if this one fails before I get my new shipment Monday.

I'll be fine, everything is under control, but really... the work that this disease takes some days. It's nuts.",diabetes_t1,1569079168,--DQ--,7,16,True,2019-09-21

Just want to vent - feeling down,"Hi,

My diabetes has been making me feel so wrecked recently. I am seeing my endocrinologist on Monday but my insulin wont work like it used to as of a week ago. I am taking double, sometimes triple, the needed dose to bring my blood glucose to where it needs to be. Ive tried different batches of insulin.

I had to leave a friends birthday early tonight because I checked my blood glucose and it was randomly sky rocketing at 12.5mmol. I dont want to go through a night of high sugars because the way I feel now it will make me way too sick. And that gets me so down, the fact I have to leave events for things like this because of a sugar level that wants to randomly jump up. Its irritating because I measured my carbs, I took the correct insulin dose, I even took my long acting insulin, and this should definitely keep my sugar level stable, but no, it sky rockets.

This whole week ive just felt disgustingly nauseous and 'swollen' if that makes sense.   


Some may think of ketones, but ketones shouldnt affect the bodys ability to absorb insulin so how does it explain blood sugars that require almost three times the regular dose to come down?

The truth is I stupidly went on a keto diet (50g of carbs a day) without any professional medical advice beforehand. What I think happened is this:

I reduced my carb intake dramatically to the point where I was taking 6 units a day TOTAL of fiasp for meals and 15 units of tresiba. Before keto, I was taking 6-12 units of fiasp PER MEAL, and 30 units of tresiba a night. I was on the reduced insulin for 2 weeks while doing a keto diet, and noticed my blood glucose going crazy when I had a cheat meal of a piece of naan bread with my food, 2 weeks into the diet. That is when I noticed my blood sugar would not go down when injecting the required amount of insulin I would usually need for this, resulting in me having to dose three times the usual amount, and now the same for each meal which has carbs in it. In turn, the large doses of insulin make me feel physically rough. 

I have only ever had this problem once in my life, and this was directly after a trip to Japan. I returned home and my insulin would not work properly. I saw my endocrinologist who was not sure why, but had changed my humalog to fiasp and the fiasp worked for me. Similarly to my situation now, when I returned that time from Japan I had eaten a lot of food, more than I would normally eat in a single meal in Japan, and this triggered my insulin to stop working for some reason.

It has just made me feel so sick this week and I had a trial shift for a new job today and was ready to quit but stuck through it (I got the job)

Just wondering if any other t1 diabetics have gone through this, and what you think it might be. Sometimes my diabetes gets me down but I remember all the diabetics who don't have access to medical care and it reminds me to remain humble and count my blessings, but sometimes I just wish we could lift this weight off our shoulders.

Currently sitting alone in a hospital with DKA from a diet I was trying,"I was trying this low carb diet with my SO, and it was a higher fat to help teach your body to burn fat in a slow way. Little did I know it was trying to kill me. 

I’ve been doing my research on diets because I know being diabetic makes it a million times harder. I’ve been taking such good care of my diabetes because I’m so scared of what can happen, so DKA just didn’t make sense to me. 

My SO mentioned the other day that I’ve been looking good, like losing weight. I was so proud. I was having heartburn every day (and still am) but I thought it’d be worth it. Fast track to the weekend where I was lifeless. I had been sleeping, and drinking lots and lots of water. No appetite, no interest in eating, nothing. My SO was concerned but I thought it was that “Keto Flu” that apparently everyone experiences. 

Today, non stop vomiting, no appetite, and I can’t even stomach water. I knew something was wrong. My abdomen was so rigid that it hurt to wear sweatpants. Midnight rolls around and my SO hears me crying in pain, and that’s when he said it was time to go. 

If it wasn’t for him, I simply wouldn’t be alive. He pushed me to go (I sent him home because he has a test at 9am) when I thought I would be fine. Currently super dehydrated, so I’m on an insulin drip, saline, and a cardiac monitor because there’s issues with my heart :)

Saturday, my husband puts it on and it seemed to be good. Didn’t shower or get it wet for 24+ hours, but by Sunday night the edges had started to peel. Monday night, almost half of one side had peeled, but I could tuck it under my shirt to make it look okay.
This evening we went on a family walk. It’s humid here, but not hot, so I was all sweaty and changed clothes when I got back. One of the peeled edges got caught on my shirt and ripped the whole thing, cgm included, off. To say I’m pissed is an understatement. I had almost 4 days left on that CGM! And this solution to my problem is total junk! I’m not a heavy workout person, I walk 2 times a day in a humid climate, that’s it, and it peeled right off like it was nothing.

640G and Guardian 3 experiences,"Hi all,

I'm hoping to hear what peoples experiences have been with guardian 3 CGM (specifically with the 640G pump - i'm not sure if it behaves different with the G670G?)

Since Medtronic removed their substription for Enlite sensors, i've had to subscribe to Guardian sensors in order to be able to use CGM with my 640G. I've been plagued with issues since inserting it ~17 hours ago at 9PM (and importantly I haven't changed eating, exercise or stress habits since)

- I was woken up ~hourly overnight with the CGM reporting values of &lt;2.2mmol/L (level was ~5)
- I woke up with a level of 11mmol/L, applied a correction and &lt;5 minutes later the CGM was reporting 5.5 and dropping rapidly. A finger prick showed my level was ~10.5
- All day the CGM has been reporting that my level is either rapidly rising or dropping.

The main difference i've noticed is that the ISIG values are awful. The Enlite sensors often maintained an ISIG value of ~40-50, and dropped to &lt;20 after roughly a week as the sensor died.

The Guardian sensor was reporting an ISIG of 8 when I inserted it, and has since fluctuated between 20-30. The sensor is located on my abdomen, about 10cm away from my bellybutton (where I always kept the Enlite sensors).

I'm interested to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences with Guardian and a 640G. I know it's been less than 24 hours since i've put the sensor in, but I rarely had issues like this with Enlite sensors. I'm just a tad worried this is going to be my life for the next year until my insurance will cover another pump and CGM.

Struggling with fiancés highs and lows,"I’m at such a loss, I’ve been engaged to my fiancé and living with him for over a year and recently his highs and low have just been so bad. He’s constantly frustrated and can’t seem to dose correctly. He’s had T1 diabetes for 3 years and he’s 27. 

He says it hurts every time he injects and has some pretty bad bruising on his stomach. Lately everything has revolved around his T1 diabetes and he keeps describing himself as rotting from the inside and dying a little bit every day. 

It’s really starting to stress me out. He consumes the same thing everyday for breakfast (pure protein shake) and a sandwich for lunch so he knows how to dose for that, but then he says that dinner messes him up.

I almost feel like he’s blaming me because I’m in charge of making dinners, but he won’t cook and I always try to keep things decently low carb or carb balanced. 

Lately he’s been talking about how maybe we should just eat different dinners, but seems miserable talking about the idea at the same time. He’s thinking about just resorting to eating a sandwich every night for dinner. 

I feel like he just needs to learn to dose better or get a monitor, but he refuses. I know when he’s low he always tries to fix it by eating candy or dessert instead of sugar tablets. Then he’s high and frustrated about that too. 

He just says “this is how T1 diabetes is for everybody” and justifies by saying his A1C is always okay, just not his daily highs and lows.

He’s also about 15 pounds overweight if it matters, and refuses to try and lose the weight saying he won’t ever lose the weight because of his diabetes. He does run every other day during the week, but I haven’t seen a weight change. 

I love him, but I’m so tired of his overwhelming negativity around his disease and being told I need to just deal with it and it’s the nature of the disease.

I just want to stop hearing him say he’s hurting all the time and using his highs and lows as an excuse to be aggressive or apathetic. I want to stop feeling like it’s my fault and that he resents me for being able to eat whatever I want. Recently he’s also started getting more and more aggravated with me when I don’t “eat enough” and accusing me of having an eating disorder, but I’m a healthy weight and just don’t need to eat as big of meals as he feels he does.

Any way to share realtime Omnipod insulin delivery info?,"So my son is currently using a Dexcom G6 and and an Omnipod (older version, not Dash). He's still in honeymoon and due to that he has some fairly frequent swings in insulin delivery.

Obviously, the goal is to get him doing this himself, but he's 12 and its something he's getting better at.

We are not doomed. Life doesn't suck. We are actually pretty normal people, we just have to take same medicine, which most of the world also has to do.

Late onset type 1?,"My mom had some bloodwork done recently that indicated prediabetes. Her A1c is 5.7 and she’s been doing fasting glucose checks that are always around 110-120.

Watch ‘Magic Pill’ on Netflix!,"Hey all, I am not sure if this is super relavant or not, but I recently watched Magic Pill on netflix and was super intrigued by some of the information. 

The show highlghts the importance of diet with relation to physical and mental health. Last year, I went on an aggressive diet to deal with my fatty liver (metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance) and I ended up going through the happiest time of my life. I had freakishly low carb meals (Thanks to Dr. Bernsteins book - not the popular dude, the diabetic one). I ended up going back to college and my strict diet slipped and my sugars were out of wack again. I was more stressed too..

I strongly believe there is a major relation between diet and mental and physical health. This may be obvious, but it was not until I trialed it myself that I realized its validity. 

Anyways, If you have access to the show/netflix, I highly recommend it. Lots of interesting information about low carb, high (good) fat meals. I know it may not be for everyone, but I figured it was worth mentioning.

Questions from a newly diagnosed T1,"14 days ago I came here and read the ""It's okay not to be okay"" post and bawled my eyes out for 2 hours straight! The clarification of ""This IS a difficult disease"" and ""I'm NOT alone"" and ""Others have the same difficulties as you"" really hit a switch in my head. Thank you so, so much!

I have really needed contact with a group of people in the same predicament as me, to see the trials everyone goes through and its not as easy as my endocrinologists makes it sound. 

I'm a 35 year old T1 diagnosed in march (6 months ago) from Denmark  
9.9 HbA1c in July  
Tresiba (8 units morning) and NovoRapid (10-15 units daily)  
Dexcom G6 monitoring system

Allthough I have been looking through the forums the last few weeks, I still have several questions which I hope you can help with.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I have day to day variations, where my insulin dosage and food is the same, but still I have a large variation in bloodsugar levels. I take 7 units of insulin for my morning porridge (High carb, I know)  I have BG levels between 6 and 15 after an hour. Is this.... normal?
2. Some nights I dont sleep well, and I feel I have no energy left in my system. I could sleep 8 hours at night and still have a 2 hour nap mid day and go early to bed. Is this normal to feel so exhausted? How much does stress/feelings/sleep affect you?
3. Any good carb counting apps out there? Preferrably with pictures and common foods allready in the app.
4. I would like to monitor my insulin/food/exercise more closely, is there an app that incoporates this with the G6 readings? (I find the Dexcom app lacking) 
5. My doctor told me to stay high in the beginning, over 12mmol/l // 220mg/dl would be fine. I have done some reading and found 5 to 9mmol/l is the typical range for a diabetic T1 and have tried to stay within these limits these last months. Do some of you have other normal high and low limits? 
6. Later complications. I have heard much about eyesight worsening and losing limbs in extreme cases. Are there any papers/research about how high (Or uncontrolled) the BG levels have to be before this could happen?
7. I have a CGM and use pens, how useful have you found having a pump? (Or other equipment?)
8. I believe I am on my way out of my honeymoon period, seing my insulin intake increase by 3-7X. How was your experience?
9. What are your ranges and how much time are you able to stay inside the normal range?

|BG Range Metric (mmol/L)| BG Range Imperial (mg/dl)|Percentage of Time (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|&lt; 5.0|&lt; 90|2|
|5.0-12.0|90 - 216|78|
|\&gt;12.0|\&gt; 216|20|

These are the ranges which I use for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Super high in the heat?,"Thankfully this has resolved now but I wanted to see if anyone had experienced anything similar.

I'm currently on holiday and visited a subtropical forest area. Very hot and humid, temperatures up to 38°C and I was on my feet all day. I was running high overnight and after breakfast because of misjudging unfamiliar meals - no biggie, it happens sometimes.

But I could not get my BG to drop below 18 (324?) and it was up at around 22-23 (396-414) for a significant part of the day.

Usually just a short walk in the sort of heat I was experiencing would start to drop my BG, and back home if it's even up to, say, 25°C I often need to lower my basal if I'm out and about. But on this day I was on 100% basal and smashing insulin - I probably took 20+ correction units - and my BG would just not. come. down.

It was really unpleasant and frustrating. Finally later in the evening I took a huge bolus and got down to 10 (180) overnight, and my insulin worked fine the next day so I don't think the heat had damaged it.

Is it possible I was so hot I ended up with a weird stress response that cancelled out my usual sensitivity? I'm struggling to work out what the fuck happened because it is the absolute opposite to my expectations and usual experience.

I am a newish type one. I have known I have been diabetic since April but the doctors didn't know for sure which one until last month. I have been a long time kratom user. About 3 years.

Atorvastatin 50 mgs per evening 

Metformin 500 mgs twice a day

Clonazapem 0.5 mgs one to two times as needed.(use it when I am staring at the wall until 4 am.)

i think I need help,"Hello, I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this. I find it embarrassing to play the victim. I understand everyone has problems, a lot of them worse than type 1. However, I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. This October will be 5 years with t1. I’m 25, M. I am from Oklahoma and got the disease when I was playing juco football in NY. I was a place kicker, so I wouldn’t actually say “playing”. The disease didn’t seem so bad at first. I didn’t realize the severity maybe. I ended up medically withdrawing and back to Oklahoma I went. It threw off my football plans. I was still able to be on a D1 team in Arkansas the next year, but I left that after a year. The NCAA deemed me ineligible. I could only practice,and I struggled changing my life style. This was the beginning of a downhill slope. I was frustrated with the disease. I was also realizing how big of a deal this actually was. After a year in Arkansas, I came home to get my degree from state school. I’ve been graduated for 9 months now. Things haven’t been easy. I identify as an athlete. I always have. I train hours and hours every day. Now playing soccer, hints why I was a kicker. I guess what I’m trying to get it is at this point the disease has seemed to fully take over. The stress from working out makes my blood sugar high. My numbers are getting worse and worse, even though I am active nearly all day. I do construction, landscaping and coach. It just seems like this disease has caused me so many setbacks. Like I said, I hate making excuses; but I genuinely feel like at a time in a young mans life when he is exploring and realizing his potential, I’m left worrying about my disease. It’s been hard thinking about who I want to be and become in the future because I’m so concerned with my present and my numbers. It’s caused heartache and pain in my personal relationships. I now wear glasses and my eyes seem to only be getting worse. I’m in great shape, but I feel like I’m rotten on the inside. I was just wondering if there was anyone out there with a similar story or something that helped them in their darkest days of being a diabetic. I feel as if I realized I have this for the long hall and there is no way out or nowhere to go. I know I’m not the cleanest eater. I am horrible in the kitchen. I can barley boil water. I make eggs every morning and try to eat a low carb lunch with some carbs at dinner. It’s gotten to a point where I’m scared to even eat. Any advice on cooking or figuring a better way to prepare meals for an active diabetic would also help. Again, I’m sorry for the victim mentality, but I figured explaining my situation to this subreddit could help.

Is there someone who tried insulin pump and his management became worse than with pens? I want pump because my bg is falling at night so I would lower my basal at night  but I like pens because I dont know if I would like to have something attached on my body all the time because I think it wouldnt be comfortable.

At the end of my rope.,"I'm so emotionally drained. I haven't even gotten this darn pump set up yet and it's honestly been so stressful. Not only am I terrified of the things. But this whole process has been one problem after another. First my insurance kept trying to send it to an old Dr. For approval who the hospital refuses to take off my file despite my asking for the past 2 years (this is not the first time I've had mix ups because of this. I legitimately had to switch pharmacies earlier in the year because of this.)
We got it sorted out and I got everything approved but when MedTronic tried to bill my insurance it wouldn't go through because for some reason my dad's insurance was still listed as my primary despite my being dropped from it almost a year ago.
Got that sorted, it's here my training was supposed to be Wednesday but the pump got here early so I figured I'd call and see if I could move it to today but she was actually going to get ahold of me because she had a family emergency and needs to reschedule me for Monday.
Now I have this huge box sitting in my living room that I can't do anything with for a week. 
I feel like everytime I think I see the light at the end of the tunnel something crap happens. I just want to get my sugars in check. I'm so tired of the highs and lows and the mood swings that come with it. I'm tired of feeling like garbage and my head hurting all the time because lows give me headaches.

LUCOZADE,"Ive had type 1 diabetes for 22 years, since I was a kid. 

This comes from UK experience only.

I always remember doctors and nurses telling me how to treat hypos, and it would always involve the energy drink Lucozade. Lucozade seemed and still seems to be the go-to treatment for hypos according to doctors and nurses. 

I never really put much thought to it until my recent checkup. Now that im older and I make better choices in my diet for my health, I was waiting to see a nurse when I notice all the Lucozade posters on the wall and instructions on how many millilitres to consume to raise your blood glucose by a certain amount. 

It got me thinking... why is it that Lucozade is the go-to option when theres so many better healthier choices? 

I went home and looked up Lucozade and found out that they were recently owned by GSK, one of the worlds largest pharmeceutical companies that produce some of the most widely used diabetes medications. They recently sold Lucozade and Ribena to Suntory who still maintain Lucozades position in the medical world (not that they have a choice though seeing as how engrained it is amongst diabetics minds/lifestyles to be used as a treatment for hypos)

The concept of pushing their energy drink product as the standard for treating hypos when its not healthy at all just to boost sales is sad to me.

and all this comes to now. feel really reay down and i have had suicide thoughts a lot lately. and have been thinking if it would be better if i just ended it all. dont feel motivated to do much and i dont really want to live with my diabetes anymore.

If you're in Europe: Medtronic 640G is a pretty good pump/CGM combination,"I believe 630G is in countries like US and Thailand and 640G exclusively in Europe (+any other counties that sell/stock it). I've tried both 630G and 640Gs with their respective CGM-systems and I have to say 640G with the CGM seems a lot better. It suspends basal before low (not AT low like the 630G) automatically - I haven't gone below 70 mg/dL ONCE since starting to use it - and also continues basal automatically when my blood glucose levels is going towards a higher glucose level. The algorithm for calculating the formulas for when to suspend and resume basal automatically work quite well and actually have helped me a lot with my blood sugar control. Having barely any lows is awesome! The CGMs transmitter is a newer version of the 630s transmitter, and has been very accurate for me (+-15 mg/dL the most I've ever had). I haven't had the chance to try DexComs CMG, OmniPod etc unfortunately because in my country Medtronic is the most convenient provider, so I can't say what is the best pump/CGM combination is the best but what I can say is if you can choose between the 630G and 640G - definitely push your health provider to get the 640G for you!!

The future of insulin pumps and automatic pancreas closed-loop systems,"When I met my MedTronic rep he was telling me that in the future models of MedTronic pumps they are going to be closed loop systems very likely with the feature that the user can choose target blood glucose levels where he/she wants to be. Like 90 mg/dL and system would automatically try to keep you there. And the user wouldn't have to do anything (except maybe input carb counts with meals). My speculation: maybe in some newer models set pre-meal target blood glucose level and post-meal separately. 

And the rep said future is going to be these closed-loop fully automated systems. Where user has to do less clicking. That's pretty cool right?

"Confirmed T1 diagnosis, on virtually no insulin compared to start of week with nearly identical blood sugars.","So, I'm very confused. I'm a recently diagnosed Type 1 Diabetic in late March as confirmed from high levels of ketones on diagnosis (above 3) and was in DKA, blood sugars above 30, anti-GAD test coming back positive and C pep coming back on the higher range of the expected T1 threshold.

Following frequent low baseline rates, I was enrolled on a diabetes course. At the start of this course last Monday I was on 5 units of Levemir in the morning, and 3 at night with a ratio of 1u:10g for quick acting. I typically gave this ratio and 4 hours later was back to where I started, indicating the ratio was right.

I did a fasting test and found I was at mid to low 4.0 mmol/L (75-80mg/dl) consistently which confirmed my basal was wrong. I changed my basal insulin over the course of the week and found even without taking my basal insulin I was still floating around mid to low 4.0 mmol/L. I am extremely confused as to what is going on, as I've heard about the honeymoon period but I don't understand how my blood glucose can stay the same from being on 8 units of basal to none.

I even had a pizza for tea at around 120g of carbs, started at 5.5 (100mg/dl) and gave 7 units of quick acting, less than my normal 1:10 ratio and I was okay. 4 hours later was 9.2 (165mg/dl), 5 hours later 6.3 (115mg/dl) and now 6 hours later its back 5.3 with no signs of not decreasing any further despite my quick acting not being in my system anymore and no basal being in there either.

Diagnosis mistake?,"So first of all I posted early in my diabetes journey and it honestly helped a lot and I learned a lot. So I have this dilema that I have been going to doctors and endocrinologists for about 3 months now and I have still not found what type of diabetes I have. The tests for type 1 diabetes come back negative. But my type two tests come back with just slightly high cholesterol and not much else. But then they give me type 2 medication like glipizide and now I am on trulicity. But every time I use these medications I have to up my insulin use and my fasting blood sugar just gets higher. And the amount my blood sugar goes down during the day goes lower and lower. At this point my blood sugar doesn't decrease at all during the day if I don't drink a bunch of water and pee it out, or fast.

Should I be worried that I was misdiagnosed? Because I called my endo and asked if what is happening to me is normal or something to be worried about. I wake up and my blood sugar is around 180-200 and I haven't eaten for about 10-12 hours. And then I eat breakfast and I shoot up to about 250ish and then I eat lunch and I shoot up to 300ish and then I eat dinner and I am around the 350- 390 every day. She told me that it's not bad for me to be that high but it's mentally and physically hard to be that high all the time and I feel extremely exhausted and sluggish in the brain. So I have resorted to not eat until my school days are over to keep my brain focused and not sluggish. But she just told me to eat healthier and to drink more water if my sugars are a bit high because my body will regulate itself. And I told her that it doesn't I just keep building up and then during the night I wake up every 45 minutes to a hour drink a bunch of water and then pee and do that all night. And that is the only way my blood sugar goes down. 

Should I be worried that the treatment is not working? This it the third time they put me on some kind of type 2 medicine that will make you pancreas produce more insulin and I just keep getting worse and worse. At this point I am open for any opinions.

I also did a sleep test in a hospital lab where they stick sensors in your body while you sleep and had some occurrences of intermittent breathing and moving my feet while asleep.

Had trouble staying low and needed more insulin than usual,"Hey everyone. I'm newly diagnosed about a month and a half in and I've been trying to figure out this dumb disease and recently ran into a bit of a snag after doing well. 

I have recently been able to stay low without taking a lot of insulin because I've been getting back into my intensive workouts to get back into shape for rugby. A couple nights ago I finished a workout and was at about 120 which was a little high because I had a little too much food before hand. I then had about 80 carbs for dinner (tacos so not really any fast absorbing stuff) and took a couple units of my meal time inslulin which would have been pretty standard normally because I was a little higher than I wanted. If I had been at 90 I probably wouldn't have take any. An hour and a half later at 10 PM I checked my blood sugar and was at 101. This is when I take my night time lantus so I put my 14 units in and get ready for bed.

At about 10:30 I start to feel pretty low and struggle up the stairs to check my blood sugar and it was at 25 (checked a second time immediately after and it said 23 because I couldn't believe it) I then proceed to eat far more sugar than I probably need and lay on the kitchen floor for a bit because diabetes. 

I get in bed later and wake up to 168 which I kind of expected and its below 200 so that's not too bad. Throughout that day I eat pretty normally and exercise about the same amount throughout the day (desk job so not a lot) and my numbers were continuing to fluctuate up and down. Never above 200 but I had to take more insulin at each meal than I normally do each time. 

Is this me still bouncing around from the bad hypo I had the night before? Or is there maybe something else I should consider. Like I said I'm pretty new to this life and I understand you guys aren't doctors but it is the weekend and I haven't figured out how to Google it without ending up with results about insulin sensitivity decreasing which I really dont think can happen overnight.",diabetes_t1,1567860699,canibetom,2,0,True,2019-09-07

Laser Photocogaulation,"Hello my fellow pancreatically challenged comrades

The difference in vision between my eyes is causing headaches as the other eye is trying to make up the slack. 

Has anyone had the blurry vision last over the 24 hours?  I am not looking for a diagnosis, just to get a feeling of the masses to better assess when I may need to go and see my peeper doctor and ask what the deal is.

Can you be healthy and happy long-term while eating (more than a small amount of) carbs?,"5 months diagnosed T1 here. My fasting 3-months average BSG was 13,5 upon diagnosis and has now lowered to 6.0. Dr. Bernstein outlines in his book ""Diabetes Solution"" the importance of a low-carb diet in minimizing or even reversing long-term health complications from diabetes.

I've been somewhat following it, with a lot of experimenting on different foods occasionally, and have been able to keep my blood sugar at the 80-110 mg/dL range very steadily throughout the day when I'm on a very low carb diet. On the other hand while eating high-carb foods, especially ones I haven't tried in the past, my post-meal blood sugars could have easily shot up to the 120-140 range, sometimes even as high as 160-180. I always felt guilty af when seeing numbers like that, and sometimes even felt physically ill when my sugar shot that high. So just based on these months I don't think eating high-carb foods will work for me, but would appreciate opinions.

A few questions to my fellow redditors:

1) Has anyone been able to eat high-carb foods somewhat regularly and keep their post-meal sugars at reasonable levels? How? 

2) If I understand correctly, the carbs itself are not the thing that creates long-term complications and serious health issues. It's the high and unpredictable blood sugar levels from high-carb meals. Is that correct?

3) So, assuming that 2) is correct - a follow-up question: In theoryif you find a way to inject insulin at the exact right amounts with the right high-carb foods, could you still eat for example pizza without screwing up your health from uncontrolled blood sugars? I use an insulin pump with the dual bolus option, that allows a part of insulin to be released immediately and a part of the insulin released slowly over a set period of time (apparently this is the way to inject if you're eating high-carb high-fat foods like pizza).

4) My diabetes doctor says I should still eat carbohydrates because they are the main source of energy. Is this really true? I feel like I'm able to work long days and exercise and feel energetic perfectly well on a very low-carb diet.",diabetes_t1,1567749089,tyriontargaryen5,23,3,True,2019-09-06
"Pain, sensitivity and tingling sensation at my feet regularly after lowering my blood sugars to normal levels","5 months diagnosed T1. My fasting 3-months average BSG was 13,5 upon diagnosis and has now lowered to 6.0. 

Since dropping my blood sugars from very high values (350 mg/dL upon diagnosis) to regular levels (80-120 mg/dL regularly) I've noticed pain, tingling and general sensitivity on my feet very regularly. I did not experience this when my sugars were high. 

My diabetes doctor said this might be because my sugars went to somewhat normal levels from very high levels quickly and my body is adjusting. And told me it might get better over time. She also examined my feet, said there is nothing wrong with them (sensation on my feet is normal) and gave me vitamin B12 to eat to help with the tingling.

What is a normal average post-meal blood sugar for T1 diabetics and non-diabetics?,"I know this depends on a lot of things but would appreciate a general answer.

However I don't want to be punishing myself by feeling guilty of having non-diabetic post-meal blood sugar levels.

Also, comparing a T1 diabetics post-meal blood sugar to a non-diabetic post-meal blood sugar level: are there any additional health complications for a diabetic to have a blood sugar of say 140 after a meal vs a non-diabetic having a blood sugar of 140 after a meal?

I'm currently back at school and like many old buildings on the northern end of the east coast, I don't have sure conditioning in my dorm room.

Feeling... lost?,"Hi all, I'm not really a new diabetic, I was actually diagnosed back in 2011 at the age of 12. But my first endo doctor was kind of a crack pot (He would tell me lies and didn't want to believe me when me AND my mom told him my legs would cramp up so baldly I couldn't walk and they felt like rocks after giving myself insulin) and I got out of the diabetes for a few years. The first thing is, I am terrible at taking care of myself. I've been depressed (used to be suicidal/self harm) for just about as long as I've been diabetic and taking care of myself was next to impossible for me. Especially after the leg cramps, I just stopped taking insulin and was basically okay all the way to my senior year of high school. 

I don't really know anyone who is type one diabetic who could give me any real world advice, and I just feel like I cannot do anything right with this disease.

Nighttime “pseudo-lows” ??,"Hi! 

Background info:
-diabetic for almost 13 years (Dx: 9/7/07)
-most recent A1c is 6.8%
-use a Dexcom CGM and a medtronic pump w/ Novolog, sure- t infusion sites 

SO. The past week or so every night between midnight and 2:30a I will wake up feeling low (slightly confused, shaky, hungry, etc.) but when I check my CGM, I am well above a low limit. I have been 120 -&gt;, 142 -&gt;, etc. Because I feel so shitty, I will test with my meter, just to double check, but so far my CGM as been dead on. 

When I review the CGM history, it always shows that my bg has been stable (aka no low that I am rebounding from), so i don’t think it is the somogyi affect. 

I try to go back to sleep, but my body keeps waking me up with low symptoms. If I can’t go back to bed, I will eat a snack and dose for it, just to try to “trick” my body.

Rant incoming (Dexcom G5 sensor),"My son is 10, diagnosed about 5 years ago, and has been using Omnipod and the Dexcom G5 together for about a year (been using the pod longer). He's not a big kid, not much adipose tissue, but we've had a lot of luck with the G5 until earlier this summer. He does seem to be having a growth spurt but nothing legendary, however his sensors are having tons of problems. They just don't deliver data about half the time or more (three question marks), when they do deliver data, they frequently report LOW when he's not, or high BGs when he's in range. We change them every week, so since July that's been eight sensors. Four of those have simply failed to start a session or else have had three question marks and failed to reconnect.

Dexcom aren't able to tell us anything here, they just politely offer to replace the sensor and end the call. Some of these instances of three question marks or bad readings are due to pressure when he's sleeping, but it doesn't account for the daytime readings. It also doesn't account for the sensor I just put on him, in his chubbiest site (the belly), which failed to start a session. We are heading back to school and being able to have remote BGs is essential to his care plan, because his school doesn't have a full-time nurse or people capable of understanding T1D.

I’m a 17 y/o male, diagnosed October 2018. I’ve been handling the ‘betes pretty well. I’ve had my ups and downs over the past year but ultimately my a1c has been pretty good. These past few weeks I’ve been handling it really well, my most recent a1c being 5.8. Unfortunately, the way I feel does NOT match this. My BG levels will be completely fine, but I will feel terrible. It comes in waves, one second I’ll be okay and the next I’ll feel really bad. 


Some symptoms would be tired/drowsiness, my vision will get super blurry and it will be hard to focus, feeling hot constantly even if the room isn’t, headaches, and just this general feeling of wanting to lay down and not move. I feel so tired and like I can’t do anything or concentrate and it comes out of nowhere. It’ll happen in school, at work, or at home. It could last for 30 minutes or 3 hours. My sleep schedule is pretty good, due to the fact that it comes and goes randomly makes me think it’s not related to that. Also whenever it happens my numbers are always fine, never low or high or anything. I feel like this has been happening for awhile (possibly even a year or two) but it only got really bad recently. 


I’ve told my endo but she always shrugs it off or ignores it (not a big fan of her).

Losing weight on keto diet with T1d?,"Hi,

I started a keto diet 3 days ago, limiting myself to 20g of carbs a day and the rest of my macros in protein and fat. I am wanting to lose 10kg, around 20lbs to get to a healthy weight.

I checked my ketones via  ketostick yesterday and it came back in the range of 0.8 which is quite high for me.

I am trying to not go into ketoacidosis. I understand the difference between ketosis and ketoacidosis is that ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes, where ketones in the blood are paired with high blood glucose creating a very acidic blood. 

My questions:

1. If I have ketones in my urine, but my sugars are not high, is this ok for ketosis or is it a signal that i need to change my diet back as im heading towards DKA?

2. On a keto diet, if i am eating 20g carbs a day and I need insulin to stop my body from going into DKA, how do you take insulin if your body hardly needs it? I still take insulin, maybe 2 - 4 units for a meal and then 20 units of tresiba at night. Usually id be taking 6-12 with a meal and 30 of tresiba at night.

3. If this is not an advisable diet, can you pleasw recommend me a diet that i can lose weight on?

Freestyle libre keeps coming off,"So I've using the libre on prescription for about 5 weeks. It has been an absolute game changer in terms of convenience and information regarding bgl. I love it and I really couldn't see myself going back to pricking fingers 10-20 times a day. 

That said, I've only had one successfully stay on for the whole two weeks. I've been using vet tape to bandage up my arm which has been useful during the day to keep it secure, albeit not that subtle, but my main concerns are when it's submerged in water or the adhesive starts to peel away about a week in which then prompts a lot of worry over keeping it dry and secure.

 My first sensor got snagged on my shirt when I was undressing and it came off in the bath. 

The second stayed on for the whole two weeks. 

The third stayed on for a week but it got knocked and started to malfunction.

Last night I accidentally pulled it off when drying myself after a shower. 

This has ultimately been down to my own clumsiness and I guess I'm still adapting my living habits to having the sensor on my arm, but I want something to help me keep it on without worrying so much about knocking or pulling it off by accident or the adhesive wearing off.

 I'm also worried about the possibility of Abbott eventually refusing to replace sensors due to carelessness as I've had 3 come off or damaged already. I'm unsure what their policy is, but I feel like this is not a regular amount of replacements for a typical customer. It has been under a week since my last replacement. These sensors arent cheap, so I dont think it's too cycnical of me to expect them to refuse replacements after a few in such a relatively short amount of time.

So I have two questions;

1: is there a reliable, subtle or at least aesthetically appealing method of keeping the sensor on without having to worry too much about water exposure or general wear and tear? I dont want something that makes me look like I've been shot in the arm. The less clinical the better.

2: Are you aware of any limitations on Abbott's replacement policy, or do they ultimately have a duty of care to their consumers considering the nature of the product?

Managing glucose during workout,"OK, this is gonna be a long one. 

Usually when I exercise, I tried to eat before my workouts and/or take bolus shot. I can manage my sugars with no insulin and/or food if it's a light exercising, but that's another story.

Now I have moderate/high intensity workouts for about 2 hours later in the evening (when my insulin sensitivity is quite high). 

I am also now on a slight calorie deficit or maintaining daily amount, but surely try to avoid surplus/weight increase. That being said, I particularly cut the carbs, try to consume about 80g of carbs at most (that's including low's). 

With this diet (I am used to it, have done it before) my glucose levels are quite stable and in the range (80-130mg/dl) through the day. Next, before I start my workout (warm up phase is about 30-40 minutes in 50-80% HR zones), my glucose is in the range of 110-125mg/dl. Plus, I have not consumed any carbs for at least last 3 hours before the workout. 

After the warm up (40 minutes) my glucose is already about 180mg/dl. So the question is: **how to deal with this (hoping to get some scientific info behind too)? And why it is increasing?**

I pose these questions because usually if my glucose is in the range (80-130mg/dl), and I do light exercising (50-70% HR), it keeps dropping, and I need to eat something. So, ok, maybe in this case since I am in the 70-80% HR zone, and sometimes for short periods of time even above 80%, the glucose starts increasing, because I reach anaerobic state that requires more glucose for energy compared to low level exercising. Does it increase because I have not had any carbs for a while, and the body starts to consume stored reserves for energy? And since I have not had any bolus, the body delivers glucose to bloodstream, but it is not delivered because there is no insulin to deal with it? Does this sound right?

But now the next question: **If I take a bolus shot (2 units) some 40 minutes before the workout without any snack, will the glucose remain relatively stable (of course, it will not be perfect, but considering that timing is right etc.)? Or in this case because of the bolus shot, it will simply start to drop (=since bolus is injected, it keeps delivering glucose from blood to cells, and my sugar level drops. BUT (!!!) since there is insulin present that delivers glucose to cells, my body does not trigger release from the stored reserves, and I end up with a hypo???)?** \- I am not sure about science behind this one. 

Yes, I have a sensor, yes, I can take a time out and have a snack if my glucose drops, yes, I can also have a snack and shot before the workout regardless etc. But my goal is to cut some weight (necessary for sport), plus, ending up with a low is quite annoying because taking a snack complicates everything during my workouts. I also want too avoid snacking before/during workout, because it's more difficult to manage my glucose anyway in this case, and I may end up with a higher glucose reading than those 180mg/dl, and then again I have no energy, am out of breath soon, and my workout is shit. I hope to get some feedback based on experiences and/or scientific material to read that may explain this particular case in detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. After those 40 minutes of warm up when my sugar has increased to 180mg/dl, it starts dropping again (typical for me during long aerobic types of exercises), but still during this rise at first I feel that I lack energy at some point. So how to have energy without going LO/HI and avoiding eating carbs? If that is possible at all?",diabetes_t1,1567177169,artursau,6,2,True,2019-08-30

"[UK, England] Anyone else having supply issues with Freestyle Libre sensors on the NHS?","I have been using Libre sensors for nearly 2 years now. About a year ago I moved from Northern Ireland to England. I was lucky enough to get the sensors on the NHS in NI and again in England. The area where I live now has been getting all T1s onto the libre in the last year. 

In the last month, I have started to encounter severe problems getting the sensors on prescription. Normally I get 1 month's supply (2 sensors) at once. However due to supply issues no pharmacy seems to have any and has no idea when they can obtain them.

I order my prescription weeks in advance to account for the time it takes to order in this 'specialist' item. However, nearly a month after requesting my prescription with no luck my last sensor has expired. The pharmacy did not think to tell me of the supply issues when they first knew of them. They are one of the largest chains of pharmacists in the country so I am very surprised that they are unable to get a product for over a month. 

As a result, I have a dwindling supply of test strips and no idea how long I have to make them last (I have ordered more, but the pharmacist said they could take a while to process, as I've never needed to order them from the Dr in England). 

I suffer from severe bouts of hypoglycaemia and having the arrows on the libre showing the direction my glucose level is heading has been a literal lifesaver. Thus I am quite anxious about not having an active sensor for an indefinite period. 

Has anyone else in the UK had these issues? If so, how did you get more sensors?

I have my yearly check up at the hospital tomorrow morning (great timing), is there any chance they could supply me with some or direct me to a pharmacy which could supply them?

my first year was a wild one, my a1cs darted around from 12 to 8.7, back to 11

i was struggling to afford doctors &amp; insulin, so i quit my job working in entertainment in los angeles to move back home 2 years ago. i got help filing for disability in pennsylvania, and became a test patient at UPMC. last september, they set me up with all the new tech - g6 &amp; tslim (which my old insurance wouldn’t cover).

after going thru a couple insulin changes (bc insurance) i’ve steadily brought down my a1c to 7.8, then 7.2, and this morning received my test results from a blood test in july @ 6.6 

i’m pretty stoked about it. i have a couple other health problems, and bad sugars seem to throw everything out of control, but rn life seems completely manageable. and i’m very grateful for that. thanks for reading if you made it this far 8)",diabetes_t1,1567001191,yomikemo,7,9,True,2019-08-28

Looking for advice on infusion sites!,"26yo female, just “celebrated” 21 years with T1D in July. Hyper to hypo thyroid through my preteen years, completed radiation for my thyroid/Graves’ disease when I was 18 and on levothyroxine/Synthroid ever since. MDI my entire life. Just for a little background.

I finally jumped into the 21st century this year with a Libre in February (in the process of getting approval for the G6) and started on the t:slim x2 at the beginning of August. So far switching to pump therapy and CGM has been amazing, and brought my A1C down lower than it’s ever been in 15 years. I’m so happy I finally did it, but I’ve been having some issues and could use some advice.

I’m struggling with infusion sites. Since starting, I’ve had three “bad sites” with a lot of pain or just the catheter not going in the way it should and having to start over with a new infusion site. I’m not slim but not heavy either, 5’6” and ~135lbs, I carry all my fat in my hips and stomach. I see videos of people using hips/love handles as other sites, but I’m scared to try since it’s not listed on Tandem’s website/manual as an official infusion site. Does anyone have any advice? I’ve tried inserting it standing, sitting, leaning back at a 45 degree angle, and still seem to make mistakes, particularly on my left side (I’m right hand dominant). 

Just a little defeated, I know it’s user error and could use some tips or tricks. I’ve watched HOURS of YouTube videos and still seem to be doing something wrong.

"High sugar all last week, followed by shingles","Hello my T1D family! Hoping to share my story and find out if anyone has had a similar experience. 

Background: T1D diagnosed at age 23 (five years ago) with no family history of any autoimmune disease.

Last week I had about 5 days of unexplained high sugar: 200-400. Every time I would get to the point of going to the ER, my sugar would come down to around 180-200. I’d wake up the next day over 300. I have very good control and had never had anything like this happen. I had to double my insulin just to get back under 200, only to start over the next day. I saw both my Endo and went to urgent care, along with my OBGYN because i was having awful stomach pain. Overall, I felt OK- wasn’t vomiting or anything. Endo took me off my pump and put me back on shots at my request. Sugars finally stabilized by Saturday, 

On Friday, i noticed some irritation on the side of my stomach- very close to where i do my injections. I figured i was just getting used to shots again and didn’t think much of it.

the irritation turned into a rash, and after about five days of it not going away i went back to urgent care. The diagnosis is shingles. 

I’m curious how the two things are related. I know it’s impossible to know for sure, but has this happened to anyone else? Any tips? 

Other information: I’ve been traveling almost every weekend and am preparing to move across the country in two weeks. I know stress can be a factor.

Talk me down,"I know I am freaking myself out right now so I think I'm just looking for someone to talk me down.

For the past couple of days, my insulin sensitivity has been garbage.  It already wasn't great (1 unit corrects 20-30 for me).  Let me give you a quick rundown of the past 2 days:

Wednesday:

Woke up at 108 (take 19 u Tresiba), slowly was creeping up (probably from coffee) so I take 2 units Humalog. Two hours later, I've only come down 15. At noon, I'm at 101, take 3 units and eat 15g carbs (salad w/chicken that I eat ALL the time), I shoot up to 133 (and panic because I'm never this high), so I take THREE MORE UNITS. Two hours later? I'm at 110.  Dinner time, I'm at 89, take 3 units, and eat approx 18g carbs (steamed shrimp, cocktail sauce, burrata salad).  Go on a two mile walk. Two hours after the 3 units, I'm only at 93.  So that's 33g carbs and 12 u of Humalog.  Ratio is 1:2.75.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday: 

I'll skip the morning/afternoon.  Before dinner, I'm at 123 which is super high for me. I'm not even that high after dinner usually.  So I take 3 units Humalog, eat grilled fish, bok choy, and a salad (13 g carbs).  Two hours later, I'm only down to 99.  Ratio today is 1:3.4.

Friday:

Woke up at 105. Took 20 units of Tresiba (2 more than I'm supposed to), creep up to 115 over the next 2 hours, take 2 units of Humalog and after an hour, have only dropped 14.  Lunch time, I'm at 99, take 2 units of Humalog, eat bacon and eggs, and an hour later, I'm at 91.  

I'm not so much concerned about my blood glucose levels because I know those aren't high.  **I'm more concerned about the fact that I can take 2 units of insulin and it does next to nothing for me.**  I walk 2-5 miles several days a week.  I don't usually eat more than 35g carbs a day.  I know with low carb you have to consider protein and fat but 1 unit for 2 to 3 g of carbs seems ridiculous.  My normal range is 70-120 and I'm 100% in range for the past 3 months. I even went as far as to make a dang excel graph with my daily carbs and daily humalog doses from the past 2 months. The line is trending up slightly (which is to be expected as my control is tighter, I guess).",diabetes_t1,1566580083,HollingB,6,1,True,2019-08-23

Question regarding dosage for non-diabetics to experience a low,"Hey all,   


I hope this post is not ill-received, otherwise mods are more than welcome to take it down.   


My girlfriend is a type 1 diabetic and I'm generally interested in knowing what it's like to be her (and you!) so that I may have a clearer understanding of what is going on when she experiences a low. She remembers her mother having a book (link:  [https://www.amazon.com/Insulin-Dependent-Diabetes-Children-Adolescents/dp/1859590764](https://www.amazon.com/Insulin-Dependent-Diabetes-Children-Adolescents/dp/1859590764) ) in which there was a section about how parents could experience a low... We borrowed the book at our local library, but apparently it was the updated edition... So while it was still in the list of contents, the bit about inducing a low had been taken out. It was about experiencing a low in a ""safe"" manner, and there was some math regarding the amount of insulin necessary in a healthy adult. I emailed the author, but never got an answer.  


I understand that I need to be very careful and not just take advice from any random person... So if anyone's got the book or have experience with inducing a low in someone else, do comment :)",diabetes_t1,1566504597,CellosNSpiders,8,3,True,2019-08-22
670 Flow Occlusion,"So after many years of placing infusion sites on my upper buttocks without problems, I moved my infusion sites to my belly to see if the better absorption helped with BG control.

I always keep an eye on my BG after receiving the alert and it's obvious that I'm continuing to receive insulin as my glucose is appropriately responsive.  

I'm not sure if the issue is having my waist band rub against the infusion sites (I typically wear leggings/atheltic shorts when I'm home and dress pants that hit around my belly button at work), several bad boxes of infusion sites, or that the pump is too sensitive to occlusions.

Experimenting with basal insulin,"Wondering, is there any research or information about manipulating the dosage of basal insulin?

I know, many will say that I should not do that, but I am quite experienced with all the diabetes stuff and not afraid to try.

OK. I do exercise a lot, I have cut my insulin dosages down to 30% of prescribed daily amounts (this has nothing to do with rationing, it's just my weird obsession of being healthy and avoid injections as much as possible). Since my workouts are very demanding, and I want to make very workout effective, I have started a new approach how to deal with managing glucose levels during the workout - taking large amounts of basal insulin **(I was originally prescribed 24 units, used to use 14 units due to my exercising and diet, now I use 30-40 units per day)**. 

Why do I do this?

I learned that higher amounts of basal insulin:

* lower the glucose relatively rapidly (if the dosage is high),
* increase sensitivity towards rapid acting insulin (ok, maybe not sensitivity, just their interaction causes glucose to drop),
* in the long run through the day glucose levels drop after each meal, and I feel that cells receive energy even though at first glucose may be high\*.

\*this is basically the main reason - with high dosages of basal insulin I can still perform well during my workouts even if my glucose level is quite high/higher, while with managing glucose with rapid insulin before/during workout is more complicated (those who exercise know what I am talking about - you can follow the same pattern, but glucose will be different any different day :( ). Besides, taking high basal dosages help me to sleep during the night - even if glucose is high (300), I d not need to wake up several times a night to go to bathroom; whereas, if I take my regular/decreased basal dosage and manage glucose level with rapid insulin, I must wake up and go to bathroom even if my glucose is only 130. I have had serious problems with sleep, and it is very important for me to have a rest; therefore, I gladly use this option. 

So finally, the question: what are effects of this type of experimenting that I do? Does using very high dosages of basal can lead to some problems/complications in general (like increased insulin resistance and stuff)? Does the state when my glucose level is around, let's say, 300 while on a high dosage of basal affect my kidney's\*\*, liver, caterpillars, eyes, neural/nervous system etc?

\*\*This part I find kinda hilarious, because, I mean, if the sugar is 300, then surely body wants to get rid of it, and that should be stress on all organs that deal with getting it out of the system, but then why I have no need to go to pee in this case?

I tried to research, but did not find anything that could give any insight how mad/normal it is to do something like that? If someone can explain and state facts why this is really bad for my health, I can quit it immediately, but so far I do not see any reason to stop this experimenting. I can still manage my glucose with rapid insulin, but it is more inconvenient, and especially more difficult in the mornings when insulin resistance is higher (dawn effect or whatever etc.), and in general I feel weaker while on a high basal dosage I feel quite excellent. 

P.S. I know about dangers taking such high dosage before night, and hypo's that can occur, but I can manage that easily. 

**P.P.S. Disclaimer!!! I have type 1 for 22 years since my childhood, so I have a hold of this, but I highly do not recommend to follow this pattern to anyone here who does not have EXCELLENT understanding in managing diabetes, dieting, and others affects that can trigger high's or low's!!!**",diabetes_t1,1566420238,artursau,8,1,True,2019-08-21

What value do you get from your Endocrinologist?,"I've been diagnosed for just about 3 months now and have seen the same endo twice in that time. The first time was very brief after being diagnosed with everything being new.

The second time I came in, I had a specific issue that I wanted to discuss. I've been having issues with my stomach (loss of appetite, distension, discomfort), since about a month after diagnosis. Since I've never had any problems like this in the past, I figured it must be somewhat diabetes related and wanted to get his thoughts.

This was a topic he didn't seem to want to talk about at all, saying that he is very certain it isn't diabetes related and doesn't fall under his narrow scope of expertise. I was a bit miffed that he rushed to end my appointment while I was trying to get his thoughts on this, and the questions I was asking were possible diabetes related reasons.

I've been honeymooning the past few months so my sugars have been really well controlled, so there wasn't much to discuss regarding insulin regimen. 

Anyways, my point is that I'm curious what value people get out of their visits with an Endocrinologist. Do they typically try to stick to their very narrow field of expertise? Are there certain things I should ask about to get more out of the visit? What attributes make for a good endo? Thanks!",diabetes_t1,1566293555,MrMurphles,30,15,True,2019-08-20

I’m stumped,"I apologize in advance for the long post

Some background:
Last A1C: 7.4
Diagnosed 9 years ago
17F
Have severe anxiety, have been on birth control for the past four months (I don’t know if these affect things)
I use the Medtronic 670g, with the sensor.  Humalog insulin.  
5’5 and 150 lbs (my weight rarely fluctuates, but recently I’ve dropped to about 146)
I eat a relatively healthy diet (minimal carbs, try to fill my plate with proteins and low carb fruits/veggies but I will have half a cup of brown rice or a slice of whole wheat bread regularly.  I also eat dairy)
Very active lifestyle

So I just finished a season of drum corps, and am starting marching band.  Both pretty physical activities (drum corps we spent upwards of 12 hours rehearsing in the sun each day). Towards the end of season (about two weeks ago) I began getting lightheaded/dizzy during rehearsals.  I would also get stomach cramps after eating and very nauseous throughout the day.  I had to go to urgent care for it, and after checking my out they found nothing wrong.  I’d checked my ketones, and they were never above 0.2 (I figured the trace amounts were just the burning of fat from the constant physical activity)  After getting back it seemed to have gotten better, but the first day of band, about an hour into rehearsal I got extremely nauseous and dizzy.  On my way to the nurse I ran into her and she told me that I was extremely pale and my lips were white.  My vision went blurry and o had to sit.  I was better after sitting down some time.  Of course, she pulled me out of band and said I needed to go to the doctor before coming back, so I did.
At the time I went to the nurse my glucose was 169.  About two hours after, when I was at the doctors, my blood sugar had risen to 300.  Doctor took my blood, checked everything else and I seemed fine but have to wait for lab results.  I came home, checked my ketones and I was at 0.4 so I drank a ton of water and tried to flush them.  Later my blood sugar is 182 and my ketones are at 0.8.  Cue more insulin and water.  Then they drop to 0.3.  Blood sugar is still around 180.  About two hours later I check before bed and my blood sugars steadily rising to 200, and not responding to insulin corrections.  I check ketones and it’s 1.2.  Eventually I just decided to inject about six units of insulin (I’d been using my pump prior) and drink another bottle of water.  My blood sugar finally drops.  I wake up and it’s at 59.  But MY KETONES ARE STILL AT 0.7.  At this point I just said fuck it and went about my day.  I’m still very nauseous and dizzy, and while I was allowed back to band I had to sit out a lot.
The doctor calls back, and apparently everything is completely fine (we have to ask for my A1C tomorrow cause they didn’t tell us) besides my high blood sugar.  I don’t know why I feel so sick still, and it’s extremely frustrating.  My blood sugar also is right back to 270 right as I wanted to sleep.  It was 190 before dinner (vegetarian sushi), and roughly below 150 the entire day before that.  I’ve tried calling my endo, but had to talk to a different one from the hospital who just gave the stock “drink water and give insulin” stuff and didn’t read into any of my other symptoms.

I was told that my boundaries for blood sugar should be:  Stay over 70mg and bellow 150mg. Excuse my english, i´m from Argentina

Here´s my problem: Before lunch/dinner i tend to inject myself some units of insulin just to be ready if the meal is heavy (For example if i was to eat a couple of Pizza slices) and i check my blood sugar 2 hours after eating. 80% of the time i end up with less than 100mg (The other 20% i made i overshot and now i need to eat something with lots of sugar) and IMO that´s okay because i know that by the night it will stay almost the same. My issue here is that i was told by some people/doctors that its okay if your blood sugar is at like 180 or 200mg 2 hours after lunch/dinner. 

So i wanted to ask: Am i hurting myself by keeping my bloodsugar low all day? Is it okay if i let it stay high 2 hours after a meal?

I've found that after about an hour of biking my levels drop *very* sharply and I need to constantly intake carbs to keep them steady afterwards, and this even continues after I finish my ride for the rest of the day. [These were my levels](https://i.imgur.com/P814CSb.png) from a 4 hour ride yesterday that started around 8:30am, I took my usual basal dosage the night before but otherwise took no additional insulin throughout the day. 

I understand that exercise lowers BG but I am unclear about whether it can lower it enough to cause hypoglycemia? Given that I took no fast acting insulin I would think that my body would handle this kind of exercise the same as anybody else's, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. After the large drop in BG on the graph (between around 9am-2pm) I ate about 3 granola bars, 2 peaches, a sandwich, a hot dog and 6 glucose tablets to maintain those levels - what would have happened to me if I *didn't* have all of that?",diabetes_t1,1566225696,nick-pass,16,4,True,2019-08-19

Omnipod Dash question,"Question for you all! My niece is on the Omnipod Dash system and she also has a Dexcom G6. She just switched from the last Omnipod system to the Dash. I noticed tonight (we don’t have her all the time) that the insulin I gave her before dinner is still sitting as IOB on her PDM and her BG is going up despite dinner being 2 and a half hours ago (ate at 6pm, currently 8:45pm). 

-why does the Dash system take forever to push insulin? We gave it to her about 15 minutes before dinner. 

-Should we try giving her the insulin more than 15 minutes prior to a meal? 

-Is there a way to change this setting so it delivers the insulin a bit quicker instead of over the course of hours? 

Obviously we are trying to avoid highs by giving insulin for meals before we eat and correcting as necessary throughout the day/night but it seems like the Dash just.. isnt quick enough for her. Prior to eating dinner I had her holding at about 108mg/dL which is in range for her. Currently she’s high at 324 and we’re still waiting for the insulin from dinner time to finish being delivered and kick in.

Dextrose tabs have no effect on my BG whatsoever!?,"Mostly, if I am approaching a hypo, fruit juice (about 20g of cabs) has an immediate effect on raising my blood glucose about 5mM (90 mg%) commencing almost immediately. However, carrying around little boxes of juice is inconvenient and I sought out the tubes of dextrose/glucose tablets that many diabetics rely on for correcting lows. Unbelievably, pharmacies where I live didn't stock them and Amazon strangely doesn't ship them to my country. However, many diabetics here use a candy equivalent called Super C. This contains sucrose, dextrose and glucose as well as vitamin C with each tablet containing 15g of carbs and I eventually managed to get some. However, this has zero effect on my BG even when I have eaten four (60g of carbs in total), either immediate or delayed. I simply cannot fathom why this would be.

What are your experiences with a ketogenic diet?,"Hi everyone,
I'm currently doing a ketogenic diet because I would lose a kilogram or 4. I'm in now for a couple of days.
What have you experienced if you have been doing a ketogenic diet?
What I've experienced: 
- This is an obvious one, but I need way less insuline. In 2 out of the 3 meals I est I don't need insuline anymore. I feel a lot more freedom with that.
- My bloodsugar doesn't spike as much as before.
- It doesn't need to be hard. As snacks, I eat dark chocolate with 85% or higher. Sometimes if I'm going to sport and I'm a bit low I eat fruit.
- It can be enjoyable. It isn't torturing yourself. Make some fish or meat (if you're not vegan) and spice them up. Same goes for other things and just eat things you like. Just don't forget that cheat days are allowed. Or at least a cheat meal. I eat one cheat meal per week where I don't look at carbs etc.

"Hey, diabuddies, I have a question specifically for those of you who were diagnosed young (specifically, those who were diagnosed around 1-6 years old). (I also have a tip for parents of diabetics!)","Do any of you guys have any foods you completely try to 100% avoid because of your young diagnosis? I try to avoid fruits and veggies because of it.

I was diagnosed at 18 months old, and I had sensory issues (which might also be a reason I have food aversion issues) that made it a struggle for me to eat the food i needed to eat in order for my mom to give me my insulin.

My mom used to have to force feed me most of the time, in order to give me my insulin. Which, before you say anything, was really traumatic, and my therapist and I are working on the mental trauma part now, and when I talk with my mom about it, she completely understood and shows a lot of remorse for what she had to do.

**ALSO!!!** Parents in this sub who aren't diabetic, but have diabetic kids (like, young kids, who are like, 5-7) with food aversions!!! you can take your kid to SPEECH THERAPY and they'll help your kid overcome most of their aversions!!! I didn't learn that speech therapy could help with that until a student endo doctor mentioned it at my last endo appointment after years of being shamed by my previous endos for my aversions! BUT!

Food sensitivity and BS,"Hi Fellow Diabuddies, 

\*\*\* Disclaimer:\*\*\*I debated posting this for a long time, mostly because I didn't want to come off the wrong way. So, first im going to state that this is what worked for me personally and I am hoping it could provide some stability for others in their sugars. IT IS NOT A CURE! I am not here to preach an all-natural diet where you eat all the seeds and skin of the fruit and suddenly you're magically cured. F-that. It not the answers to all blood sugar spikes, but I will say it has created an easier go after bfast with my sugars. **TLDR at the end**

With all the aside, Ill tell you the back story. So, unrelated to my T1D, for about 5 years when i would eat, about 25% of the time I would feel nauseous. It was just sort of normal for me to not feel good after eating. But as of this year i bumped up to 75% of the time after I was eating I felt crappy. I first tried cutting out dairy. That got rid of my Lower intestinal problems (if ya know what I mean). But, I still felt crappy. So, my husband bought me a food sensitivity test. One of those ones you can buy online. I didn't really want t do it because I wasn't sure of the reliability of the science behind it. But it was already purchased and I actually was curious what it would tell me. 

So, I did it. I got my results back pretty quickly and it detailed that I was highly sensitive to Eggs(whites and yolks) and Brewers Yeast. I was DEVESTATED, I f-ing love eggs. I eat them all the time. Breakfast especially. I put mayo on my sandwiches. Hard-boiled egg as a snack. Heck yeah. But then, that's when I realized that I'm nauseous all the time and im eating egg all the time. So, I decided to give cutting Eggs out a try. (I don't drink beer, so I didn't worry about that) 

I  cut them out and immediately noticed a difference in my feeling after eating. I didn't feel crappy much anymore after eating. (back to the T1D) BEFORE THIS, my blood sugars after breakfast would spike no matter what I tried. I changed my dosages/calculations, pre-bolused longer amounts of time, took the bread out, nothing worked. When I started eating Egg/Dairy free I noticed I spiked a NORMAL amount and not like Mt. Everest.  I was shocked! Day after day, i kept not spiking at breakfast. Now, eating completely egg free is a beech - I will tell you that right now it stinks.  I try to avoid all egg products. However, when I do eat something with Mayo or a bun with egg products. My blood sugar spikes and I feel it after in my bellies. 

Why am I telling you guys? Idk really, I'm just hoping someone can maybe benefit from something similar. Also, let me know if you have something similar? I would love to hear that I'm not alone.

Pump/CGM Suggestions?,"Hello!

New insurance at a new job will be kicking in at the end of the month and I'll finally be able to reconsider my ability to get a pump/CGM. I've used both and had issues with both (technical inconsistency, burden of carrying two devices, time dedicated to switching infusions, infusion site problems, etc.). That being said, the last time I used both was years ago and I'm ready and excited to hop back on the pump/CGM train.

However, I'd like to hear from you guys about what your thoughts are-- what brands you like, what advantages or disadvantages you've found with a particular pump or CGM, and more. Right now, I'm most inclined to get the MiniMed 670G, but I've seen discouraging reviews of it. 

Ideally I'd have a combined pump/CGM, as I despise extra ""clutter"" in my pockets. I'd also like something that's very user-friendly, sleek, slim, durable, with extremely positive technical support. I'd also like something with small infusion sites, as I have to tuck in my shirts and would rather not have a lump on my stomach showing.

Is it just me or do ya'll feel like there is a lot of awareness for Type-2 Diabetes(Diet, exercise, stress factors,etc) among doctors but not so much on Type-1s?

Like believe me, I've learned more about this condition outside my hospital than I have from the docs...

After posing a situation of random highs or lows with my doctor, the only answer I get is - Increase the basal or bolus by so and so...

Like... OK!! I get it - There is no particular formula for the disease but at least help me understand it properly will ya?

Here's a list of things I find out 10 years into my diabetes roller-coaster which the doctor **NEVER** gave me an idea about,

* Exercising affects insulin sensitivity( Weight lifting to be precise).
* You need to have a regular check up on your eyes, ears, kidneys, etc. for signs of nerve damage.
* Adding fiber into your diet slows down digestion resulting in slow release of glucose into the bloodstream.
* Insulin sensitivity is less when you have sedentary lifestyle/or one particular day where you have been less active.
* Basal insulin is to be decided based upon a short fast done from morning till noon.
* Protein affects BGLs??
* Stress releases a hormone called Cortisol which fluctuates sugars like crazy?
* and the list goes on...

MY A1Cs had been still decent up untill 2016 - Around 7-7.5. But after that I had to shift to my unio for 3 years and it was all over the place bouncing around from 10.5-11.4. Because you know... college.

Finally by the end of 2017 my A1C's came down to 10-11 and then by mid 2018 it was down to 9-10 and my last 3 tests from mid 2018  up untill last month was 7.5-8.5... 

So, yes... It has been one hell of a ride to go through.

To be honest... I am genuinely worried about the major complications of uncontrolled diabetes... Am I in danger?

I FINALLY found an endocrinologist who listens to me,"My A1C still isn’t great. Honestly, I feel like it’s partly because of the crappy, half-assed care I’ve been getting these past three years. I was referred to a new endocrinologist from my pediatric endo, so I thought I was getting top notch care. 

Until my readings kept coming back higher and higher, and they just kept blaming me, telling me I wasn’t doing enough, that my basals should be substantially lower and I shouldn’t need nearly as much insulin for food, and I must be exaggerating my lows. I drank an *entire jug* of orange juice over the course of about half an hour once because my blood sugar wouldn’t stop dropping. It took a glucagon to get it out of the 40’s, and then after the glucagon, with my pump suspended for nearly *six hours* my blood sugar stayed in the 130’s. 

They didn’t seem to care. Nothing was done to maybe have some sort of reason for this happening, nothing was altered, all I really got was a “huh, weird.” Not only that, my actual doctor only saw me twice in the entire three years I was a patient, and acted both times like I was bothering her and like she wanted to get out of the room ASAP. My new doctor took the time to review my charts, asked me about my medicines and how they affect my body, and then looked over my stats to figure out what needed to be done. She changed one thing, **one thing**, and explained to me every single reason why, and my daily average has already gone from 220 to 189. It’s been less than a week. Not only that, they promptly got urine and blood tests done. 

Seriously, I cannot even stress how important it is to seek proper care. I thought that I was just being too picky. I blamed myself for the longest time and got severely depressed thinking about how I was going to die after losing all my limbs despite my best efforts. My A1C is still at 7.7, but at least now I know they’re going to keep improving and doing all that they can to help.

Dexcom G6 and my T1D Kindergartner - Help!,"My T1D daughter is starting Kindergarten this fall.  

Our school district has two big challenges that we have to work around:

1. The school nurse is responsible for all care decisions (tracking BS, when to bolus, etc.)
2. The nurse cannot simply downloading the Dexcom Follow app on her personal device.  The district is also not going to provide their own device for the Follow app.

This means we need to find a good solution to allow the school nurse to view our daughter's Dexcom G6 data throughout the day.

From the research I've done, it looks like my two primary options are:

* Provide our own device, with the Follow app loaded on it.  If we go this route, my hope is we can simply connect to the school's WiFi, instead of having to pay for a data plan on the device.
* Create a NightScout setup.  If I understand NightScout correctly, we would end up with her Dexcom data on a web page that the nurse to view all day long.  Would we be able to set up some type of notification mechanism to catch highs and lows?

Are there other options I'm not thinking of?  Does anybody else have a similar experience?

In the last month, around 6 times I’ve found it unresponsive, no displaying anything on the screen, probably out of service for between 1-2h (having a CGM luckily has always indirectly alerted me of this) I freaked out the first time, removed the lid, closed it again and the pump restarted like if nothing had happened. I thought it was a defective battery. But it happened again after some days.

It’s happening between every 5-10d now, and I’ve observed the pump is going through batteries at the speed of light (and yes, I’ve changed brands) I am consuming something like a battery per week or 1.5w. 

I haven’t yet bought new batteries (I will tomorrow just to discard the option that ALL MY BATTERIES had been damage during my moving 1.5m ago) but wanted to check with you if anyone has had this? 

I’ve tried to contact the tech support of Accu-Check, but they only attend 9am-6pm (this didn’t use to be like this... it made me feel not ok tbh) and I keep forgetting during the week so I haven’t managed to talk to them yet...

Thanks in advance!",diabetes_t1,1565643098,mystik89,5,3,True,2019-08-12

Humalog Stopped Working.,"Hi Everybody.  I was diagnosed with Type 1 in May.  I have been using Tresiba and Humalog.  In the last couple of weeks, there have been some days where the Humalog does not appear to work, it's like I'm injecting water.  On other days, it works perfectly.  This occurs with identical meals, so carb counting is definitely not the issue.  I have tried two pens from two different boxes and they both cause the same problem, which is unusual because I have previously used pens from both of the boxes with no problems.  Out of desperation, I have resorted to using Novolin R from Walmart, which seems to work okay.

Has anybody else had problems like this?  Did you figure out what caused it?  I have heard of people having immune responses to particular insulins, and I'm worried I might be experiencing that.",diabetes_t1,1565648462,MNFisher1,8,2,True,2019-08-12
Yoga instructor took my phone and glucose gel,"I went to this hot yoga studio for the first time today with my Dexcom &amp; glucose gel. 

Prior to class, I looked at their website about mobile devices in the room but didn't see anything. When I arrived, I saw a sign that said to either turn off devices or silence them, so I did not think much of it. I turned off all my HIGH alarms and even my fall rate alarm. The only thing I had set was my low alarm which had been set to vibrate. My other phone stuff had been turned to night mode as not to distract anyone. 

Anyways, 20 mins into a 60 min session, and the instructor comes over my way, takes my phone and glucose gels. ""You're not suppose to have these in here!"". Of course, me being the spineless, non confrontational person said nothing but nearly burst into tears. I spent the rest of class in a panic over BG levels because I wouldn't know the difference between me being sweaty from the sauna like room or being low and needing my gel. For some reason, the walls are thick enough in this studio that my CGM disconnected. She did not even give a warning, just took it!!! 

So after class, I retrieved my phone from her and she did apologize but told me from now on I have to let the instructor know prior to class and to hide my stuff under my mat as to not give people the impression you can have your phone in class.

Is a pump break reasonable?,"My dia-versary (day I was diagnosed anniversary) is coming up. August 17th. It'll be 13 years I've had type one diabetes. I've learned so much from this disease. I've also taught a lot about it too. Unfortunately I've gone through a fair share of endocrinologists. My current doctor has been great for the past 5 years. He is a strong advocate for the insulin pump. Don't get me wrong I think pumps are great. It was like Christmas morning when I first got mine approximately 8 years ago. I have had a pregnancy pre-pump, and a pregnancy with the pump and a CGM halfway thru. It truly is an amazing medical device. However I'm going on my 2nd year with a higher than average a1c. I personally think I need a pump break. I've asked for a pump break. I don't always feel low sugars and because of that I've had 6 hypoglycemia seizures since being diabetic. The CGM is great at catching that, but I can't afford it out of pocket and insurance won't cover it. So I've felt like I've been given the easy way out by just having a pump. My last few a1cs have been 8.9, 8.3, 9.1, 10.1, 9.9, 8.9 and due for another recheck in September. My endo just doesn't feel comfortable with me going off the pump. Here's why I feel like I need a break..

- my a1c isn't improving. Regardless of changing my basal and bolus settings at each appointment, every 3 months. 
- im more tempted to eat more high carb meals because of how easy it is to just bolus wizard for my dose. 
- my tubing is always getting in the way. I've had cellulitis twice from my pump sites. 
- I feel like I use my pump as an excuse to say I'm a controlled diabetic. I catch myself saying ""at least I have insulin 24/7""..

When I was on shots I was more cautious of my carb intake. I avoided high carb meals and even ate low carb to not have to take as much insulin. I had more places to inject. My belly is full of scar tissue from the pump. If I put it elsewhere it gets snagged or yanked out. When I had used shots I checked my sugar more. 

None of this seems like enough for my endo. He says no matter if I'm on the pump or injections I'll still be diabetic. I get that. I respect that. But if I keep up the way I'm going, my a1c that high will lead to complications. I'm a single mom to 2 boys who need me. I've asked my doc about medicine for insulin resistance and he put me on metformin but it hasn't helped. And I've given it a year. No results. How can I figure out a way to fix things before it's too late? Please no judgment.",diabetes_t1,1565665797,missnerdcess096,16,7,True,2019-08-12

Omnipod/Insulin Delivery System,"I have general questions about the use of omnipods/competitors. I have never used one and I'm getting health insurance with my job in a few weeks and I'm curious and might want to try it out.

So let me preface this discussion with information about myself because I believe this is important. I am 170lbs, 11% body fat, and HIGHLY active. This is important because my Freestyle Libre (Glucose levels scanner) fell off my arm while at the gym halfway through its 14 day cycle. With this particular product, you place it on the back of the forearm.

Now, my main concern with these glucose delivery machines is whether or not they will fall off of my body. I don't have much fat on my body to begin with so I would think my locations on my body to place the device would be limited, so here are my questions

1. What devices are out there for insulin delivery, and what are the best in your opinion (personal use stories would be nice)

2. Where on your body do they tell you you can put it, and where is it not recommended, but you hear people place it there anyway

3. We have a pretty good health insurance and my place of work, do insurances generally FULLY cover these things or just a percentage.

4. How often do these things stay on, are they intrusive in day to day activities (I work in an office setting)

5. Is there some sort of Grace period I can take it off and be insulin free before I put the next one on. For example: Work all day with it in, workout at the gym for 1-2hrs, then put it back in?",diabetes_t1,1565444115,HoopsFromADominican,4,2,True,2019-08-10

I'm lost with my Humalog,"Hi folks. Sorry for my English, I'll do my best. 

I'm T1 for 24yrs now and just went out of hospital because of a bad ketoacidosis. 

Long story short, ear infection and no regular controls fucked me up. I fucked up. 

Now I run a freestyle libre to monitor and I try to be really healthier and stable. As in the hospital in fact. 

I've got question because I've got trouble being stable. 

Morning ratio is 2.0/10g
Noon is 1.1/10g
Evening is 1.0/10g

I'm doing my calculations really fine and precisely, but ends up usually really low. I'll reach a doctor to maybe adjust those ratios. 

But I'm lost with some questions:

1. My Humalog lasts around 4hrs. If I do a bolus to assimilate a meal, then 2hrs later, I eat let's say 10g more. Should I wait or can I do another injection? Asynchronously? If so, I guess I shouldn't care about my glucose level?

2. When should I do my bolus? Does it depend of my result? If I'm low, normal or high at the meal moment? After? Before? Meanwhile?

3. When I'm really LO., I usually take half a grape juice brick (15cl) then wait. How long should I wait if it doesn't gets better?

4. Are you adjusting your ratios by yourself? How long do you wait to be sure? How do you do?

But I’ve tried this after fasting overnight, like with dawn phenomenon, when there aren’t any carbs to consider and it’s still about 1:20. I understand sensitivity is usually low in the morning but it happened last night too. We went to an event and I ate nothing but a little bit of meat. I decided to not take any insulin because ya know- zero carbs. 🙄 I went from 85 to 135, took 3(!) units of humalog and only dropped to 91.

Can You Help This Type 1 Diabetic Get Ripped?,"Hey! I'm a 19-year-old Type 1 diabetic who is interested in becoming ripped by extensive exercise over the next 2 years.

But due to the issues surrounding safety, the confusing statements about how my disease affects my gains, and a lack of knowledge about where to start, I haven't really started the process yet.

**I'm willing to do:**

* 1-2 hours of exercise a week.
* 3-4 days of cardio
* 3-4 days of weight training

**A few questions:**

* Is it hard to build muscle at 20, instead of like puberty? (Assuming not?)
* Will my Type 1 diabetes negatively affect my muscle gains?
* Should I get a fitness trainer? When I go to him, what should I bring up? Is there any with knowledge of T1D?
* As someone is considering getting a DEXCOM G6 and a glucose monitor, will they still function effectively at 10-12% body fat alongside a significant portion of muscle?
* How do I safely handle the risk of hypoglycemia from muscle training and cardio?
* Diet recommendations? (No, not a fad diet like Keto.)
* Once I reach a ""perfect body-type"" that I want, can I ""freeze it""... or is the diet perm?

Late night blood sugar problems,"So for the past week, my blood sugar has been in the 70-90 mg/dL range at 9pm before I would go to sleep. Every time I’ve woken up it’s been in the 300-330 range. I don’t eat much before bed to make it do this and I’m taking my recommended Lantus. 

Last night at 10pm when I was getting ready for bed, it was in the 50’s so I had a 4oz juice box and drank maybe 3/4 of a cup of milk. For dinner I had had pizza around 8pm, but had taken the insulin at 7pm. At midnight my sugar was at 120, but by 2:30am it had shot up above 400mg/dL. I woke up super irritated and took like 16units (way more than recommended) for a correction and woke up at 80. 

Why is this happening? My sister says it’s my lantus not being enough, but my sugar is consistent during the day. Is it the long acting carbs in the pizza that got me last night? Even if that was the cause last night, the past few nights I’ve eaten even earlier, but still spike up around 3.

Switching from Medical Assistance to employer-based health insurance. Help.,"I'm 27 years old. I was able to be on my mom's health insurance until I turned 26, at which point I started using my (now ex) wife's health insurance. My ex-wife and I split up and divorced and I moved a few hours away into Minnesota. I was living with a very generous friend who let me relax and took care of me financially for a while. Before I found a job in the area I had just moved to, I was able to get Medical Assistance through the county since I was an unemployed type one diabetic. It was great. I was able to go to the doctor as much as I needed to and didn't have to pay a cent at the pharmacy. Sure, it was a little annoying that MA wouldn't cover the Freestyle Libre meter, but I was working with the diabetic team to get a pump eventually anyway.

Well, it came to be time to renew my MA with the county, and with my current job I exceed the income guidelines so now I'm forced to take insurance through my employer. So now I'm going to be paying almost $200/month in premiums, $50 copays for my short acting insulin and $50 copays for my long acting insulin. Testing supplies are only covered at 80%. Not to mention there are no mental health services covered until I hit the deductible, so the counselor I've been seeing 2-4 times a month basically all year long is no longer an option for me unless I'm willing to go thousands of dollars in debt. And then they still only cover 80% until I've spent like $5000 out of pocket to hit my maximum costs for the year. 

I've gone and talked to HR at work and asked if there was anything they could do to help me but haven't heard anything back yet. I was still living relatively paycheck-to-paycheck before all this insurance bullshit, but still comfortable. I'm now actively looking for a second job just so I can basically afford my health insurance which won't even help me take care of myself. It's so frustrating. 

I've called and called and talked to a lot of different people over the past couple weeks and the only thing I've really learned is that nobody seems to give a single fuck. I'm hoping someone here can offer some guidance or maybe there's programs out there that I'm not aware of. 

I just want to take care of myself mentally and physically with the same doctors that I've been seeing for the past year without having to go thousands of dollars into debt, but that doesn't seem possible.",diabetes_t1,1565291646,anonytrees,6,2,True,2019-08-08
For those who used to take lantus: Did you ever accidentally take two doses and feel super messed up in the morning?,"I'm asking to see if there are people that had the same experience and maybe can explain what was happening.  

While in highschool (10-15 years ago)  I'd occasionally forget whether or not I actually took my dose of lantus before bed. There were a couple times I gave myself two doses because of this. I don't remember my blood sugar being low, I'm sure it was, but the feeling the next morning would be very different than a typical low. I'd wake up feeling like I didn't know where I was or what I was doing. I was coherent but extremely confused. It sounds like a typical low, but it did feel much different than previous lows (hard to explain now that I'm typing it out). I've Never felt that kind of way since coming off lantus, even during my lowest lows.

So I've always been curious if those long acting insulins that last all day react in a different way or produce different side effects when you over do it. Obviously if I were to double dose on my regular insulin I probably wouldn't have even woken up the next morning.",diabetes_t1,1565292295,PickleDee,1,3,True,2019-08-08

Why am I so intensely insulin resistant?!,"So I know insulin resistance is a thing but damn, mine feels so severe that it makes being able to do normal tasks challenging. So I take 20u 2x a day of lantus. And admolog for fast acting. I take 1u for every 6 grams of carbs and every 30 points over 100. 

Well now that I'm working a warehouse job, suddenly my insulin needs have dropped dramatically. Yesterday I dropped my self down to 10u of slow acting. Just once. I didnt take any fast acting what so ever at anypoint. I havent taken any fast acting today either and my blood sugar is at 137. 

Anyways, I dropped to 37 at work yesterday morning. I went into work at 227, but didnt take anything because I knew I was gonna drop from working. 2 hours later I'm low. I eat 30g of carbs from glucose tabs. An hour later I'm 68. I eat about 50g of carbs from swedish fish and 15 from glucose tabs. An hour later I'm 66. I eat another 50g of carbs of swedish fish. I get home about 4 hours later and I'm 62. I get frustrated and eat about 100g of carbs of various things. Bread, candy, icecream. Then my blood sugar spikes to 350. I take 4 units. Then I crash to 47 3 hours later. So I eat about 80g of carbs worth of gummy bears. Then I drop again in the middle of the night. I'm not sure what time or how bad because I felt so sick and shakey I didnt even bother to check. I just stuffed my face. 

Then I wake up this morning, and I'm 53. I drink a can of coke, and have a cliff bar. That was about 70 grams of carbs. I skip taking my slow and any fast acting acting because at this point I'd rather run high all day at work than deal with even more lows. 

I go on break 3 hours later and I'm 242 but I feel shaky. Again in tired of the lows so in scared to take more insulin. I eat like 20g of carbs. A few hours later I'm 81. I eat 30 grams of carbs. I get home and I'm 137. I havent taken ANY insulin at all today. Its been 24 hours and I've had sooo much carbs. 

The thing is, if I dont do any physical activity, my insulin needs are insane. I can hardly stay under 250. What the hell is going on?

Anyone have funny T1 related stories?,"I know diabetes can be a drag, but sometimes there's funny moments. Anyone have any good stories? Here's mine:

In college I was a huge punk fan (still am) and would go to concerts when a good band would roll in. One night I went to see NOFX at house of blues with some friends. It was a great show, we pregamed and I had a couple of beers at the event  and stayed in the mosh pit nearly the whole time, so after the show ended I was dripping in sweat, sore, and drunk. We left and headed back to campus. 

My friends peeled off to their dorms and I kept walking because I lived in a part of campus that was further away up this hill. As I was walking up the hill my omnipod was beeping at me saying the 3 days is up and time to switch to a new pod. In my drunken state the beep was annoying me, so I figured I can cancel this pod and toss it in a trash can and put the new one on when I got back. But, since I was in the pit bumping into people and generally getting tossed around for an hour, the site was bloody. When I peeled off the omnipod and tossed it, I started bleeding pretty significantly from the injection site. I didn't notice right away until my pocket felt wet. I look down and there's a large line of blood from the site on my chest down to my pants. I didn't have a tissue or anything to clean it up so I pressed my t shirt against it. I was wearing an off-white shirt no less. 

I worked as an RA so I headed to the residency office since it was closer than my dorm to grab some paper towels and clean it up. As I walk it the two RAs on duty that night were in the office and stopped their conversation and stared at me in shock, they thought I had been shot in the chest! 

I don't realize this right away so I'm half-slurring that I need to freshen up. In the light I see that my shirt is pretty wet and red at this point so I start laughing at how much this looks like a bullet wound. The RAs are in disbelief and I stop for a second, look at them and say ""I had a crazy night."" Didn't explain further. Just went to the bathroom to grab some paper towels and walked out. 

I didn't fully explain it to them for about a week, during that time they kept their distance, but we all had a nice laugh about how much I freaked them out.",diabetes_t1,1565309034,lexdfox,7,23,True,2019-08-08

I went to bed with my blood sugar at 85ish.  An hour later my phone starts beeping at me and letting me know its not getting a signal from the Dexcom and that it may take up to 3 hours to reconnect.

456.  Apparently between the time I checked myself and was at 90 and the time I woke up, my Omnipod occluded, but didn't alert me.  When I took it off there was insulin all over the tape.

Last Wednesday, I was preparing to leave for a 2 day long road trip and I changed my sensor that night. The first one wouldn’t connect to my pump, so I just figured I’ll change it and put another new one on. That one didn’t connect either.

I just gotta vent about my endocrinologist for a minute.,"So my endo is young and new and has only been an endo for a year. And he's frustrating the shit out of me. First off, in november I took my pump off and decided to take a break for a few months. Within those few months, I moved and changed insurance so I ended up with the endo I have now. I wish I could find a new one but I can't

Anyways, in may I told him I wanted to hook my pump back up but I just needed prescriptions for the supplies. He tells me no. He tells me that my a1c has went up 2 points and hes not comfortable. I explain that between moving, the stress and having taken my pump off, that my blood sugars have inevitably been a little sporadic. He tells me no still. Tells me I need to bring down my a1c first. 

So I seen him yesterday. My a1c dropped 3 points. I lost weight. Changed my diet. I logged everything. Unfortunately they are still sporadic because I dont do too great on shots and I work a physically demanding job. Which is why I am desperate to get my pump hooked back up. 

HE STILL TELLS ME NO. Then he told me if I'm eating low carb and not having any carbs at all for some meals, I shouldn't have spikes. I explained that protien can spike your blood sugar and it does for me sometimes. He was like 'oh I dont know who told you that. That's not true. Fat does. Protien does nothing. I dont believe your counting your carbs correctly.' Mind you I've been diabetic for 15 years.

Then he tells me that he wants me to go through insulin pump training as well as see a dietitian to learn how to count my carbs correctly. I KNOW HOW TO TRACK MY FUCKING CARBS. I KNOW HOW TO PORTION MY FOOD. I KNOW HOW TO USE MY FUCKING PUMP, IVE BEEN ON THE SAME ONE FOR 5 YEARS. 

and THEN he tells me that 20u of lantus 2x a day is extremely unusual for a type one diabetic. Which I'm certain it is not. I tell him I am insulin resistant from having PCOS and he tells me that that would not effect my blood sugars. 
 
THEN he asked to look at my meter. So I gave it to him and he tosses it on the counter and goes EWW, there's blood on it. And washes his hands. Like, I was embarrassed and thats gross, but I'm sure almost everyone here has gotten some blood on their meters before. but I don't think it called for that reaction. 

The dude is young, and cocky, and he wont take anything I say seriously because I dont have a picture perfect a1c. It was 10.4 a few months ago. Now it is 7.3

It's not perfect but when I was on the pump it was 6.2!

I was asked again about getting an insulin pump and I'm a little more open to it but I'm still a little against it? I'm not really sure how I feel. 

I do feel that it would help me tremendously and it could help me better manage my blood sugars, but the whole physical part of it still scares me. I know I sound very immature for worrying about my physical appearance, but I hope you can understand that it is a huge deal for me and I'm just a very self-conscious person. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who struggled with this, so I was wondering (if you have experienced this) how you managed to overcome this ""fear"" of having something on your body 24/7 out to be exposed to the public.   
Also, if you have experience with insulin pumps, could you talk about which ones you've used and which ones you liked and recommend? (I live in the USA! i think there's different insulin pumps in different countries?)

"Fasting, ketosis, and reducing insulin! HELP!","Hi! I’m looking for advice on longer term fasting/safely getting into ketosis. 

I’m in the US, so using freedom units. On my phone so please excuse autocorrect typos! Will edit with conversions and for grammar when I get to my computer later today.

History and disclaimers before you yell at me: I’ve been type 1 for 4.5 years, and am a very research-driven person, so am trying to be careful and gather a sh*t ton of anecdotal + peer-reviewed tips before I do something stupid and hurt myself. I have a Dexcom G6 which is my greatest love in this world and keeps me sane and safe. I have pretty awesome control, especially recently as I get my mental health and other physical health issues under control (recent a1c of 5.7 with very few lows which is insane progress for me!) but as I exercise more, I’m finding myself having to lower my basal *and* still eat 75g of carbs with no bolus just to stay afloat sometimes. My endo and I have discussed that this could be solved by switching to a pump from MDI so I can suspend my basal as needed, but insurance problems are slowing this process down. And yes, I am in frequent contact with my endo and am going back to meet in person in 2 weeks, which is why I want to do my own research now so I can bring it to our next discussion!

Right now, improvement with my bg numbers isn’t my primary goal as I am finally happy with where I am for the most part. I am interested in keto, though, as maybe if I switch to fat burning for fuel I will avoid the occasional necessity of eating so many carbs(?!). Anyone have experience with this as a T1d? I’ve read some about this but have specific questions if you’re willing to share: how long did it take to get into ketosis? How low did/does your blood sugar get before you get into ketosis? Have you gone low going into ketosis, and have you figured out how to avoid this?

I have intermittent fasted in the past (20/4, OMAD) and am very interested in doing a longer fast (5+ days, and as diabetes allows of course) for the benefits of autophagy for other health issues. Has anyone done this? I have found a grand total of one peer reviewed study on T1Ds doing 24+ hour fasts, but I’d love to hear from you.

I’ve reduced my basal so much at this point because of exercise I feel like I genuinely would need to stop using it to avoid hypos assuming I started fasting at a reasonable bg # (maybe 150+ ? Again I’m guesstimating based on previous experience with intermittent fasting.) I don’t want to stop my basal completely without doing a shit ton of research and talking with my endo of course. This seems crazy to me? I’ve historically been the person who struggles with highs more than lows, but now that I’m exercising a lot more I’m eating and eating carbs to just stay around 100. Suspending basal is normal, though, for you pump users right? So theoretically if I truly didn’t need insulin on a fast I could be okay? Or does this still put me at risk for DKA, even with in range blood sugars and with a proper and careful refeed to ensure blood sugars don’t spike while in ketosis? 

I guess this is a brain dump for me as much as it is asking for help. 

I’d love to hear 
a) your thoughts on the mess my brain has left above 
b) your experience with t1d + keto and/or fasting of any type, and 
c) if you feel the need to yell at me for considering getting rid of my basal please do but please back it up with sources because I’m having such a hard time finding them myself!

So, my boy 8yo has diabetes for almost a year and a half and so far everything was good. We had some particular amount per carb that we were calculating and I and my wife were able to keep it under control in the green zone. 

Regular dosages for Lantus and Humalog were:
Lantus 7u
Humalog 1u/15carbs


A few weeks ago it changed and now it is hard to keep his Insulin low. If we gave him an old proportion for Humalog it wouldn't work as we expected. It would go up to 20 or higher. So we needed to increase the dosage. Now it's almost 1/8 (instead of 1/15 before) for Humalog, which is almost twice as more.

We increased his Lantus by 1u. And now we're giving him almost twice more of Humalog to compensate the food.

No Ketones so far. But the BS is a rollercoaster, rarely in green.

How do you separate having diabetes from your identity?,"I’m 20 years old and I’ve been diabetic for almost a year now. I have found that it’s always in the back of my mind. For the first few months, it was strange interacting w people who knew I had diabetes and people who didn’t.

But now I’ve found that I almost prefer talking to people who don’t know I have diabetes. I had a fun conversation with someone and it was kinda refreshing to not be “weighed down” by people knowing this about me. 

I literally can’t hide the fact that I’m diabetic, and I would prefer my close friends to know for safety reasons and I also want them to understand what I go through.

Fiasp - my thoughts so far,"Brief profile: mid 40s, MDI, don’t low carb at all (although I’m thinking of giving it another go), daily exercise - mix of cardio and weights. UK resident so get meds on NHS. 

For my sins, I have to admit that I eat quite ‘normally’ and dose as required. My A1c is usually in the high 5’s to low 6’s. However, my endo thought that I was having too many spikes, particularly after breakfast. I’m on Lantus long acting and had been on a Apidra (Novorapid before that but stopped due to insane time taken to start working). He suggested changing to Fiasp and I’ve been on it for the last six weeks or so. 

Honestly, I absolutely love it. I find that I hardly have to pre-bolus and this makes life so much easier and I can be more spontaneous with what I eat. I found this particularly useful if I’m ever out. I may pre-bolus if I’m going to tuck into a bowl of something particularly sweet, for example - this will be only 3-5 minutes max and also depends on my baseline before eating. 

I’m really quite shocked how effectively it works. I’ve heard from others on this sub that it can wear off after a while so all fingers crossed on that. After getting my Libre this is the next best thing that’s happened in my diabetes management since I was diagnosed.

All of a sudden needing TRIPLE the amount of insulin just to stay in range,"I'll start off with saying I do NOT use a pump. I always manually inject with a syringe and vial so I know exactly how much I'm taking and I don't need to worry about blocked lines and all that. Also, I have not changed my basal insulin dose at all. I haven't made any of the textbook novice diabetic mistakes.

This started a few days ago and I'm totally flummoxed as to what is going on.

I usually eat a tuna sandwich for lunch on Saturdays. I have a meal routine that I tend to stick to. After getting crazy high blood sugars and dumping in insulin the first couple days this started, I decided to take a massive dose to avoid it, while also expecting to possibly run low, but had snacks on hand just in case. I usually take 4 units for said tuna sandwich but today I took 12. Exactly three times the normal amount, and I *finally* ended up normal after eating, for the first time since this started.

I've gone through periods where I needed to increase insulin because of lack of exercise, stress, the usual, but I've never needed to increase it this much. Not even close. It seems rather ridiculous and honestly very strange that my required insulin has *literally* tripled.

I would say this vial of insulin is bad but it was working just fine before a few days ago when this all started. I inject in different spots all over my stomach, arms, and thighs so I do not have any welts or scar tissue (whatever you want to call it) from injecting in the same spot.

Tips on how to make a patch pump stick?,"Hey :)

Things are going...good but rough i guess. She did get me the pump and cgm...finally. I do my training next friday yay!! However she has been switching up my insulin and telling me I have to stop certain habits. Okay thats fine i have been trying to anyways. Big one is regular soda ya i know bad bad bad but i dont drink it excessivley or all day i have 1 soda with a meal then water. This dr seems to think i sip on it all day long every day and i drink nothing else. I tried to explain it to her she didnt really aeem to care. Ok cool i can stop drinking it. Thats not an issue. Then she wants me to quit fast food. Ok i can manage to do less but completely isnt possible. Some days I dont have the time to cook and need to just grab a quick meal. I have been better about choosig healtheir options when i do. I mean as healthy as you can get for fast food lol. She also made the statement your carb ratio is not fonna work for a bigger girl like you. Ummm thanks? I am extremely self concious since i gained 30lbs from meds a few back. I am off those and workig to lose the 30lbs and some extra. So that made me feel like shit. And overall im just even more worried then before. She has me so worried that i am gonna ruin the pump and how it works from my habits that im almost like not wnating it. I know there will be changes needed for it. I am ok with that. I have been working to quit soda completely. Down to 1 a day with dinner.  Which trust me is a feat. Idk just some advice or maybe tell me what changes yall made when you went on the pump?

Better results with shots than pump?,"My insulin pump broke yesterday, so I've been taking shots again while waiting for a replacement pump to arrive.

One thing I am noticing is that my blood sugars seem to come down much more consistently with the shots than with the same bolus on the pump.

For example, I was 183 mg/dL when I woke up this morning, so I took my usual correction dose of Fiasp using an insulin syringe (8 mm length). Over the span of 2.5 hours, my blood sugars lowered to 102 mg/dL, in a very linear fashion. Later in the day, I corrected another high of 140 mg/dL and over the span of another 2.5 hours, my blood sugar lowered to 80 mg/dL, again in the same linear fashion.

Contrast this to similar situations when I'm on my pump. I will be high, take a correction bolus, but after 2 hours my blood sugar will either have remained the same or gone higher. Take another correction bolus and wait. Then another. Finally 6-8 hours later, I will finally start coming down.

As far as background goes, I'm taking these injections in the stomach in the same areas in which I put my infusion sets, so it isn't the case of me injecting in a different area and getting different results. These insulin syringes have 8 mm needles, my infusion sets have 9 mm cannulas, so that's pretty apples-to-apples. Same insulin, Fiasp, not using any others. Not doing anything different, but seeing radically different results.

For what it's worth, I realize this is a very small sample size for comparison, but still, I've been so frustrated with diabetes lately, and am starting to wonder if I'd be better off on MDD than the pump.

Question about type 1 and exercise,"I've been a type 1 with an omnipod for about 3 years now. I just started working out for the first time last night since like 3 or 4 months ago. Cut my basal in half and also my dinner bolus. I went to bed around 140ish(not IOB from dinner) and was awoken by dexcom with a 270 at around 3 a.m. I woke up at 6 a.m and took half a unit to correct. Then on the way to work I got some hashbrowns. I've been a 1:4 ratio in the morning and so I did the 1:4. Then when I arrived at work I started to go pretty low. The question I have is this:

Could I still be insulin sensitive from my workout the night before? Also, if I am, would that mean I would be a 1:8 ratio in the morning? Then a 1:16 at lunch(because I am normally a 1:8 at lunch)? Could this period of sensitivity be longer because I was so out of shape? I was very active and an everyday lifter in the past and the insulin sensitivity only lasted about 6 hours before.

I also understand everyone is different, but I wanted to see if someone who was out of shape that started lifting has had the same experience.

Any insight would be great. I turned my basal off for a few today because I keep going low and my stomach cant keep up! If anyone has any ideas for snacks or drinks to help with lows that are easy on the stomach let me know! My go to has been sour patch kids for the past 3 years but my stomach seems to be having a harder time with them.

Help?","I've seen lots of Edgepark horror stories on reddit and was wondering what your experiences were with Edgepark? I am on my last Dexcom sensor and they say processing could take 2-3 weeks! So I guess I'm wearing this thing until the new ones come.

The Edgepark rep also started discussing price with me, and then cut herself off and was like, oh wait... your insurance is interesting! Your insurance company does not allow us to discuss the price with you. You place the order and then they bill you, we cannot tell you the price up front.  WTF??? How sketchy is that? My insurance company won't allow them to tell me the price? I was like, whatever, place the order, I need this stuff and I can worry about the price and argue with my insurance company later. But it definitely left me with a bad feeling.

Any advice? Does anyone know if I can just order supplies directly from Dexcom, not covered by my insurance? That way if Edgepark is being slow or I've run out I can just buy extras from Dexcom? I know that would be super expensive, I just want to know if it's possible in an emergency.

Also, why is it so damn hard to get CGM's? They need ""prior authorization"" from my insurance company *every time*,  aka every three months. And they can't enroll me in auto re-ordering, I have to call back every three months *for the rest of my life*.  I understand (to an extent) this kind of oversight with insulin because it's a drug and too much or too little can kill you, but this is just some plastic shit that monitors my blood sugar!  Why is it so hard to get this shit??

Apple needs to hurry up their research and start making CGM's (they've discussed they're working on this several times). Waiting in line at one of those overcrowded stores is better than this purgatory. Why can't I just buy this shit at Was-Mart?

Follow up question: can I just buy a Dexcom G6 at War-Mart? Or a similar brick and mortar store that wouldn't require these medical supply companies?

T1D and pregnancy,"Hi everyone!

As thrilled as we are to become first-time parents, we are well aware of the importance of maintaining lower sugar levels to prevent complications. She's between 7-8 weeks currently, and doing such a tremendous job of staying within a tighter range than normal so far.

We've met with her endocrinologist to learn some of the initial steps, but have our first appointment with an OBGYN in a few days.

We've done some preliminary research, and recently started reading ""Balancing Pregnancy with Pre-Existing Diabetes"" by Cheryl Alkon.

We're looking for some advice from this community about what to expect over the next few months!

"This kind of post is way over done, but my A1C is 5.8% and when my doctor told me, I immediately burst into tears.","I've been diabetic for ten years as of June 25th of this year. It has not been a fun ride. Until last year, when it was at a 14, my A1C has been literally unreadable. I thank my lucky stars that I have never been in DKA. I am so lucky that I haven't had any further complications. There was a severe kidney scare about three years ago, but that was all. After alot of hard work, and my SO kicking my ass into gear, I had reached an A1C of 9.8%. to me, this was phenomenal. I've never had it so low in my entire life. I've never seen single digits ever. So, I did even better. Watching my numbers fall, and learning that 215 is not good because it's actually readable on my meter, has done wonders to my health. I may have gained weight, but I feel like a new person. Imagine my unbridled happiness when my doctor walked into the room today and said ""5.8"". If I wasn't sitting, my knees would have buckled. 

I'm proof that it's never too late to get a grip on your health. And yeah, it's fucking HARD. it HURTS. It sucks donkey ass.

 But on the bright side, glucose tabs are actually yummy. And you get to piss on Karen's when they pull ""HeY u CanT hAvE ThaT"" every time you reach for a non-diet soda. Also: you can jump lines at Disney. So, it's not fun, but it's not the worst. For anyone out there who needs to hear it:

Help me dealing with a coworker,"So recently I started working at the local university (I also study there but a part time job is great to keep my financial spendings in check). I work at the IT helpdesk and the first few weeks everything is great. I get introduced to one of the two apprentices (a common model in Austria), one od them being in his 50s (not so common at all). Lets just call him OC (obnoxious coworker). Around the second week people notice my sensor and start to ask all the usual questions which i answer patiently and try to joke around to make them mkre comfortable. Not so OC. Apprently he used to work in a inszituton for teenagers with problems and worked alont time volunterily for the red cross. He had to change because he had some kind of health accident and now is an apprentice here at the IT helpdesk. OC constantly gives me advice how to make hralthy food while smoking and discussing which beer is best in his lunchtime. I try to ignore it. Yes you can make cak3 out of bananas and oath flakes, but guess what, I prefer cake where I can actualy enjoy the taste thanks. One day, it's a slow day as its summer and there are hardly any students at the university right now we have an extrended lunchbreak. Somehow we talk about the red cross and some experiences. (A different coworker is currently doing his civil service there. OC has no chill on me this time. Not only does he tell me thst diabetics dont notice when their sugar is over 300, no. He flat out hits me with the ""you do know that there are long time consequences and you will probably end up without working kidneys?"" 
Why thank you you giant twat. Rest assured I'm not planing on experiencing my 50 anyhow. Why would you tell that a 22year old girl? Is it because you wasted your life and now are pissed?

General Poll for I:C ratio,"Backstory: I have had T1D for nearly two years (one pump and dexcom) and literally eat the same meal for lunch everyday. Though this meal is rather high in carbs and probably glycemic index, I have been able to time insulin dosage to have my sugars flux about 20 mg/dL most times. However, all the sudden just this week, my sugars are now skyrocketing to the 280-300 mg/dL range and I never go that high. The insulin is not spoiled because I can stack the dose and come back down over a while and the pump site has been changed with no difference in spike. I don’t think I’m getting sick or anything and this spike only happens at lunch (no other time of day). Basal rate is also recently tested and fine.

Canadian insurance for Libre or dexcom?,"Just got a letter in the mail from Manulife stating they had covered our Freestyle Libre sensors in error, and that we will no longer be allowed to claim them after August 1st 2019. (That's also the day my annual reimbursement limit resets)

Bad insulin,"So last week I went to the pharmacy to get my normal vials of humalog. After arriving home I noticed the boxes were damaged, they looked like they had gotten wet. I had walked home and it was a fairly hot day, it’s about a 15 minute walk from the pharmacy to my house. I decided due to the box damage that I would use this insulin first and keep my other insulin for later. Thankfully I have a little stash. So for the past week I have been having high blood sugars every time I ate, even low to no carb meals. Needless to say I changed pump sites a few times and would give myself extra insulin. Until today I had the revelation that maybe the insulin was bad. Lucky for me I had those extra boxes and it worked great I came down from my high quickly and during dinner I didn’t spike up crazy like I had before. So i decided to call the pharmacy and see if they would replace these odd boxes and they said the fridge had a water leak and the water froze and the boxes of insulin had just gotten wet and they would replace the boxes. Needless to say after being diabetic 23 years I didn’t think twice about the condition of the insulin even with the box damage. Sadly I didn’t take a picture of the boxes. 

tl;dr I received wet boxes of insulin that ended up being bad, so check your boxes before you leave the pharmacy!",diabetes_t1,1564545647,kykythebarbarian,7,4,True,2019-07-31

Is there any way to waste less insulin? (Omnipod),"Hi,
Recently I got an Omnipod and I love it. I've had it for a few weeks now and it's great, but one problem I have is that I'm wasting so much insulin.

I always fill the pods up with 150 units (as directed by my endo) but another problem is, sometimes I'll go through all of it (I'll have like 3 units left) and other times I'll have a bunch of units left.

How to Naturally Reverse Type 2 Diabetes,"This article looks at how you can reverse type 2 diabetes naturally.

Diabetes is one of the most popular diseases in people around the world. It is a condition that makes your blood sugar level higher than normal. Diabetes can be divided into Type 1 and Type Diabetes, the latter being the most common.

# What is type 2 diabetes? Important &gt;&gt; ([Complete Guide About Diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/search/label/Diabetes)) &lt;&lt;

This is a chronic condition that prevents your body from using the insulin it produces properly. Insulin is responsible for regulating the movement of sugar in your cells. In type 2 diabetes, instead of the body converting sugar into energy, it stores it in the bloodstream.

The difference between [type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-diabetes-dysfunction-and-dementia-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) and type 1 diabetes is that the latter is caused by insufficient insulin in the body due to the immune system in some people who destroy the cells that produce insulin. Unlike type 2 diabetes, a person's lifestyle does not contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, making it difficult to prevent it.

# Why type 2 diabetes occurs

This type of diabetes occurs because the body cells become insulin resistant, ignoring sugar from the blood. If there is too much sugar in your bloodstream for a longer period of time, muscle and fat cells ignore the instructions of insulin to remove sugar from the blood and therefore more sugar accumulation in your bloodstream. Under normal circumstances, your pancreas produces enough insulin to drive sugar into your cells. However, during the development phase of type 2 diabetes, your cells ignore sugar and therefore the sugar continues to move freely in your bloodstream. This forces the pancreas to produce more insulin to try to maintain normal sugar levels, but fails to keep up with the long-term pace. The excess sugar in your body is sometimes converted and stored as cholesterol, which is why most victims of this type of diabetes are overweight. Inactive lifestyles, smoking, and poor nutrition are the most important factors associated with the development of this diabetes. The disease can also be hereditary. Although the disease can affect a person of any age, people from the early to mid 40s have a higher risk of getting this condition.

# What it is like on a daily basis for people with type 2 diabetes

[People with type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/11/Type-2-Diabetes-Symptoms-Diabetes-Health-How-Webs-United-States-USA.html) have the highest risk of increased hunger, fatigue, numbness of the hands and feet, excessive thirst and the urge to urinate frequently. Blurred vision, weight loss and slow cure for infections other symptoms that people with diabetes have. These symptoms develop gradually so that some people will not notice the change in life and will not even know that they are suffering from this condition. This condition is progressive and can have devastating consequences if it is not checked in time. Over time, high levels of sugar in the bloodstream can cause damage to small blood vessels and optic nerves, kidneys, or worse the heart. Large arteries run a high risk of hardening, which can lead to heart failure and stroke. Frequent urination can lead to excessive loss of water in the body, causing it to dry out. The kidneys are also forced to work harder so they can fail. In the worst condition, type 2 diabetes can lead to organ failure, causing amputation. Keeping on taking medication is a struggle that people with type 2 diabetes must endure every day for the rest of their lives.

# Treatment for type 2 diabetes

If you, a family member or a friend are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you will be happy to know that there are treatment methods that can control or even reverse the condition.

# Diet and training treatment

The first way to treat type 2 diabetes is to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep your body fit. By exercising your body consumes a lot of energy, hence the need to process more sugar. If more sugar is processed, there will be no excess sugar in your blood. When it comes to dieting, avoid high protein and fat intake and make complex carbohydrates a large part of your meals instead. Such carbohydrates include whole grains, potatoes, and pasta. You should also regularly take meals in small amounts to ensure a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream. If you maintain a healthy lifestyle, you can easily fight the disease without using drugs.

# Medication approach and [management of type 2 diabetes](https://www.howwebs.com/2018/12/diabetes-management-nurse-training.html)

Although the above treatment approach is simple and easy to follow, it may not be certain whether it will work, hence the need for medication. Medications are usually given to help the body respond more quickly to insulin. Below are some of the drugs that people must take to survive if they have type 2 diabetes.

**Metformin andquot**; This medicine works by reducing the amount of sugar released by the liver and reducing sugar absorption in the digestive tract. This automatically lowers blood sugar levels and therefore makes cells sensitive to insulin. However, this medication can cause bloating, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.

**Sulfonylureas and quot;** This medicine works by stimulating insulin production. However, they may stop working after some time, cause weight gain and abnormally lower sugar levels.

**Biguanides survey;** These drugs work by reducing the amount of glucose in the body. The side effect of this medication includes weight loss.

**Megalitinides survey;** These medicines are taken before meals with the aim of stimulating the production of insulin. Their impact is short-lived, although they have immediate effects. They can cause low blood sugar levels and cause you to arrive.

**Thiazolidinediones -** These drugs work by allowing body cells to accept insulin. However, they can cause a heart attack. SGLT2 inhibitors - They work by preventing the re-uptake of sugar in the blood by preventing the kidneys from losing it in the urine. However, they can cause low blood pressure, vaginal yeast infections, diabetic ketoacidosis and urinary tract infections. Regardless of their side effects, these drugs are good for patients at risk for heart attack or stroke.

DPP-4 inhibitors; They block the functionality of dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Their side effects are joint pain and pancreatitis.

GLP-1 receptor agonists and quot; These are injections that slow down the metabolism and therefore lower the blood sugar level. They can cause weight loss, pancreatitis and nausea.

The decision to use medication can be influenced by various factors, including blood sugar levels and other health problems you may have. Finding the ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes may require medical advice. You may need to combine different medicines to control your disease.

Do you have to keep using the above medication for a lifetime? Is it possible to reverse type 2 diabetes? Well, there are some programs designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who treat the condition naturally. Such a program is The Big Diabetes Lie.

The Big Diabetes Lie. This is a 456-page book written by Max Sidorov and The International Council for Truth in Medicine (ICTM). It contains strategies for naturally reversing type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, the book promises to free you from drug slavery through a procedural health guide called The 7 Steps to Healthy and the Big Diabetes Lie.

# How it works

The program informs users about everything that has to do with type 2 diabetes, how it develops and how to combat it. With this program they learn about the adjustments they can make to their lifestyle to protect them against not only type 2 diabetes, but also against other diseases. The program asks the reader the question: do your current food choices keep you diabetic? Some of the lessons that will be learned from this book include healthy food and the avoidable, choice of vitamins, distinguishing healthy fats from the unhealthy, and how, among other things, to reduce the craving for food. The book also teaches you how to maintain the correct PH level to make your body unfriendly to diseases such as cancer. In general, the guide emphasizes healthy eating and lifestyle routines as the key to controlling and even reversing type 2 diabetes and preventing an attack by other diseases.

The Big Diabetes Lie claims that the pharmaceutical industry is out to exploit the people living with type 2 diabetes. Based on the authors' argument, the industry is running for profit by selling drugs that they know cannot fully treat Type 2 Diabetes, but insist that one cannot survive without their use. The major pharmaceutical companies are afraid that other successful approaches will affect their business results and bankrupt them. According to the authors, drugs treat symptoms instead of removing the cause of the disease and cause even more life-threatening side effects compared to those of the disease itself. This is evident in the medicines mentioned above because none of them lacks a side effect.

# Why it is successful

Unlike the drugs that only address the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, this program addresses the cause of the problem to free the patient forever. It teaches you how to reverse type 2 diabetes naturally. Medicines are only intended to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. The guide also uses natural strategies and does not cause any adverse consequences for the user. The program has worked for thousands of people around the world and perhaps your solution.

Conclusion All in all, type 2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disease. Although there are other factors, a poor lifestyle is the main culprit. Informing people about this disease is the first step to combat it. How do we inform the victims and prevent others from being diagnosed? Understanding everything about the situation is the key. The above guide sketches practically everything about this disease. There must be public awareness of what people should eat, how they should exercise, control their weight and change their lifestyle. Most people have a hectic life and have little or no time to exercise. To make matters worse, they consume junk food in large quantities, making them easy prey for type 2 diabetes. With proper training on observing a healthy lifestyle, type 2 diabetes can become a thing of the past. This can be the breakthrough of diabetes that saves your life.",diabetes_t1,1564319978,mehtabmk,2,0,True,2019-07-28
Price/ copays for testing strips,"I just picked up a prescription of strips for my mom who also has T1. Her copay (Medicare and supplemental coverage) was $5, whereas it used to be something like $60. My copay on strips with private insurance has similarly dropped this year from I think about $50 to less than $10. I have a Dexcom,so rarely fill my Rx. We think it may have to do with competition from CGMs. Any thoughts on this? Are we unusual in that we've seen drops like this?",diabetes_t1,1564320332,marty505050,2,2,True,2019-07-28
Novalog to Admelog,"I turned the dreaded 26 and my new insurance is refusing to pay for Novalog and instead is forcing me to switch to Admolog. I’ve already tried making a fuss to my primary/endo/insurance but no one will budge so it’s pretty clear I don’t have a choice even though I’ve made it clear to everyone I’m uncomfortable switching from the only insulin I’ve used besides Lantus...

Anyone have any advice? I use a 670 with the sensor so it’s not a huge safety concern but I am most definitely irked that they’re forcing me to switch. I haven’t done a ton of research into admolog but I’ve read that it’s more comparable to Humalog which I’ve never used.

So it was my birthday party at work...you know where this is going.,"So since I work in a bar that’s open till 2:30am, I get to celebrate 2 hours of my birthday at work and still have the next day off. It’s pretty neat. A lot of the people I know and work with knew me before I got diabetes and have been there with me and I love them all dearly.  I spent the first 7 months of diabetes thinking I was type 2 and basically on a starvation diet. It’s been hard to break those habits, I still look away from fancy baked goods I used to love like cupcakes and ice cream even though a minute later I’ll remind myself that it’s just a numbers game now. I CAN have that stuff in moderation!  So for my birthday last night a great customer brought in some gourmet cupcakes with the carb and fat numbers so I could correct for it! So thoughtful! The thought and the gift were, just, enough to make me tear up :)   

There is one customer though, who just doesn’t seem to want to understand no matter how many questions he has. I’ve explained the difference between t1 and t2 many many times and he acts like he gets it but then asks questions that prove he never listens in the first place. He’s a problem customer who instigates drama between the girls but never seems to do enough to get kicked out. 

I had just done the math and was coming out of the back taking the first bite of cake I’ve had in nearly 2 years.  He looks directly at me and says “Oh well I guess you don’t give a fuck about your blood sugar today.”

I had enough, I smashed that cupcake right in his ignorant face. There were more cupcakes. Fuck you, I win. He starts screaming “fuck you bitch I hope you go into a coma” just as the bartender grabs his shirt and the floor manager comes for me.

I was sent back into the back and told my behavior was not great while he can’t stop himself from laughing. He’s like “ok we all hate him and that was really a great move but I have to make it look like I’m not just going to let you smash cupcakes in customers faces when they upset you. So, hang back here while I go smooth this over.” So shitty guy leaves (he always says he’s never coming back but shows up again the very next day so whatever) and I get to have a new cupcake to enjoy with my friends. 

It was a great moment for me because I have a bad habit of being meek to avoid confrontation. I don’t hit or slap customers and rarely yell at them even when it would probably be perfectly fine to raise a small fuss.  I guess I was just tired of him not getting it no matter how many times I laid it down, him ruining that incredibly important moment for me and a little bit of catharsis about never having a moments rest from diabetes; always running in the background like a janky app with annoying pop ups.

Prescriptions,"My least favorite part about diabetes isn't the money or the other terrible things with it. It's dealing with prescriptions. I hate it. CVS is the worst.

So now I'm sitting outside CVS waiting for my prescriptions which should of been filled.

Pregnancy with a Pump.,"So I'm like super annoyed today. I'm about 6 months pregnant with my first rn and my body is changing A LOT which has been challenging enough to deal with PLUS my insulin needs have been fluctuating wildly as well. 

I just hit the much talked about insulin resistance a couple of weeks ago...right after having an incident with a bad cartridge that leaked out every drop of insulin I'd JUST LOADED (it leaked on the table before I'd gotten the old/used cartridge out) so I lost about 200 units of insulin for nothing. That was enough to literally make me cry (and not just because of hormones). 


And because of my massive baby bump that's only getting bigger, I haven't been able to clip my pump to my pants because maternity pants are super stretchy esp around the waist (duh) and have no pockets, so I've been clipping my pump in my bra as that's the most secure place for it atm (and I've been biting at the bit to get my shipment of longer tubing sites because my belly makes the shorter ones awkwardly too short). 


This morning, I get dressed and sit on the couch to have my breakfast in relative comfort, and my pump is digging into me like a damned torture device no matter how I try to sit it in the deep chasm that is my cleavage now...so I finally gave up and clipped the blasted thing to my bra strap. Idegaf that its clunky and funky looking, at least it's not digging into me and sending me into a murderous rage there. Appearances be damned, I just want some semblance of comfort back.

LADA? T1 or something ells?,"Hello, so I have a bit of a weird story and I don't know if this fits in here but I just really need some advice and see what others think.

I am a 20 year old male, and about a month ago my mother in law got a glucose tester. And tested everyone in the family including my wife and me. And I was up in the high 500's. So we went to the ER the next day and they pumped me with fluids and sent me home and then to a doctor's appointment the week after. So they put me on metformin to try to stabilize me I guess. Then I went to the doctors office the week after and they did tests and said they would start me on metformin and later insulin. 

Then going down to do my blood work the assistant runs down to urgently get me to a diabetic educator to start me on insulin the same day. I start on insulin and metformin that day. After that I kinda started feeling more normal. I would start feeling the highs more and recognize when something was wrong. Fast forward a week to me going back to the diabetic educator and she ups my dosage of insulin because my mornings are way to high and evenings ( I am only on lantus). Then I come back to the doctors office again a week later and he sits me down and tells me I am type 2 diabetic. And starts me on glipizide a medication that is only supposed to work on type 2 diabetics. And he tells me if you hit over 140 call me. And every single day for 4 days I hit over the 200's consistently all day. So on day 5 I started going back on insulin again and I am still in the 160-170 most of the days but I don't hit those high 200's anymore. so on Monday I am going to see a nurse and they sent me a referral to a endocrinologist. 

Anyone have any advise on how to handle this? Tests I can ask for to clarify or see what treatment I need? Because the doctors keep telling me they don't know what is wrong with me and they don't know if I am type 1 or 2 or even some other types. And it is stressing me out not knowing for almost over a month now.

My thoughts on looping (with omnipod/dexcom g6),"Hey there fellow insulin addicts, I'm a longtime lurker and wanted to share my experience with looping. I'll break it down as simple as possible.
___________________________________________
**Devices**: iPhone X, Omnipod w/Riley Link, Dexcom G6
___________________________________________
**History**: I am an active 23 y/o and have had t1d for ~7 years now. I've always kept my bloodsugar somewhat under control having an A1C in the 7's. Not the best not the worst. I had an endo appointment before I started looping and had a nightmarish 7.9 A1C. Luckily for me, I had the riley link coming to my door step soon. (it takes over a month to get the riley link)
___________________________________________
**Setup**: The setup is the hardest part. You'll need to have a handle on scripting in the MacOS terminal (PM for help, I'm somewhat of a computer nerd), If you're a non-Mac user, the process gets even harder. You'll need to learn how to download and install the latest version of MacOS on a virtual machine (VM) to install the loop app on your iPhone (once again, feel free to PM me for help). You're going to run into errors and it's going to take way more time than you'd like to get this baby purring. 
___________________________________________
**Immediate Thoughts on Looping**: If I had to rate the system, I'd give it a 5/5 any day of the week. I've been looping for over a month now and am almost always in the 90-120mg/dL range, its absolutely incredible. I've managed to get my A1C down to 6.4 in just one month.

The beauty of looping is that the software constantly has eyes on your bloodsugar and will increase/decrease basal rates accordingly. Like the omnipod, it will recommend bolus (looping bolus is more accurate than omnipod bolus though) to fix bloodsugar. An amazing feature of the loop app is having high and low boundaries, you can tell the app to keep you between 75mg/dL-120mg/dL and it does a fine job doing that. Possibly the most black magic part of the whole system, you'll need to find your insulin sensitivities ([link with guide on setting that up](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/settings/settings/#3rd-insulin-sensitivity-factor)). Insulin sensitity is the most important part of looping that can be overshadowed - it runs the whole show.
___________________________________________
**Final Thoughts**: To me, the worst part about being t1d is waking up to high or low bloodsugar and having to take care of it; inevitably, it will make you feel *off*. Since looping, I've been waking up to 100mg/dL every single day and never shooting up or down throughout my day. I feel incredible. I never go to bed wondering if I'm going to wake up in extreme ranges. I recommend this non-FDA approved system to anyone who wants to have their diabetes stablized and improved while putting in less effort than before.

Does anyone else have an infected site every time they change sets?,"Title might be confusing as I didn't know how else to word it. 

I have been a T1D for 11 years and on a pump for 10. I switched to a Medtronic pump and CGM about 2 years ago, and prior to switching to this company I had used Animals, T slim, and Dexcom. I had never had skin issues with any of these three companions. Then came Medtronic. I am super allergic to Medtronic adhesives on their infusion sets and sensors. I always have redness and irritation when removing sets and sensors, and often am itchy under my tape with my sensors as they are on for 7 days. I have gotten welts and blisters before from sets and sensors in the fall and spring months when my skin has been the driest and itchiest. I also have scars on my stomach from the adhesive sets on the adhesive. Once taken off my skin becomes red and raised and sometimes scars. 

I have developed more sensitive skin over the years so part of it is likely due to that but I have never had the issues I have with the other companions I have used. I mention the skin issues because since using medtronic, it seems that every time I change my set, the old set is swollen and infected. I never leave a set in for more than the maximum 3 days, and there have been times where I have accidentally ripped out a set after a day or two and it is still ""infected."" What I mean by this is the area around where the canula was is red and raised and painful. Sometimes I think I see something resembling puss where the canula was. I always have a red, hot, bump under my skin for multiple days at least and cannot use that site for at least a week or two due to the skin and under skin irritation. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this normal? Does it have anything to do with my sensitive skin? Is it because of Medtronic's adhesives? Could I also be allergic to the plastic Medtronic makes their canulas out of? (I use the Mio infusion set with a plastic canula)

Why can’t people seem to understand,"I have no idea how I’ve been keeping my cool for the last 6 years at my job. Not a single day seems to pass that some one asks me why don’t I change my diet so I can stop taking insulin. “My husband fixed his diet and he doesn’t need insulin anymore”. “You need to start eating cactus because it’s been proven that it helps with diabetes. You won’t need to do those shots anymore”. “How are you diabetic you are the skinniest person here”.

Problems with Tandem x2 sites pulling out while sleeping,"My son (14) moves his pump site around as he's supposed to, but pretty much every time he uses his arm, it's about a 50% chance that it'll pull out either partially or fully during the night from his tossing and turning.

The two options I can think of to stop burning through sensors are to tape this shit out of the tube at the insertion site so that there is something to stop the pressure directly on the site, or finding a device or method that would allow him to strap the whole pump to his arm so that the tubing and pump are close enough to not get hooked on anything.

Has anyone else who has this problem come up with a great idea to solve it?

Paid Research Study to Design Collaborative CGM Tools for T1D Adolescents and Families,"Hi,
 
Are you a parent/legal guardian of a child with type 1 diabetes between 13 and 18 years of age, and do you use a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system of any brand to track your child’s glucose levels for at least a year? If yes, we invite you and your child to participate in a research study on understanding needs for designing CGM tools for parent-teen collaboration in diabetes management, as a part of a research study at the University of Washington, Seattle. The study has been approved by UW IRB under protocol FWA #00006878.
 
If you and your child are selected to participate in the study, you will be invited to join a private online group on the Slack platform (https://slack.com/) where you will be asked to participate in activities and conversations to share the benefits and burdens you have experienced with CGM usage. These activities can be completed at any time convenient to you during the week. We will post descriptions, sketches, and other prototypes of ideas for tools to support adolescents and their guardians to collaborate on diabetes management. You will be asked to provide feedback on these ideas. You will also be asked to generate your own design ideas, sketch your prototypes, share them, and discuss with other participants in the group. There will be separate groups for adolescents and parents. The study will last for about 8-10 weeks. There will be two 10-15 mins activities each week. All participants (both teens and parents) will receive $5 in gift cards per week (up to $50 per person) as a thank you for participating.

If you are interested/have any questions, please reach out to us at yyu2016@uw.edu. Please feel free to forward this message and the information sheet to anyone else you may think would be interested in our study, and they can reach out to us. Thank you!

Permanent low feeling?,"For the past week I have been feeling low pretty much 24/7. The day it started, I woke up around 2am and felt shaky, but my sugar was 280.

I woke up again at 5am and felt shaky, but I rolled over and went back to sleep. Then, at 8am I finally woke up at 70. I drank some juice and then started to eat cereal. After a few bites, I completely lost my appetite and felt like I was going to throw up. For the next few days I had very little appetite and had to force myself to eat anything, despite a constant low feeling.

Ever since then, I’ve been feeling low almost all day, every day. I got my appetite back a few days ago, but the low feeling is still there. It doesn’t matter what my sugar is, the low feeling won’t go away. My blood sugar has been high, low, and perfectly in range, but it makes no difference.

Question: How much plastic waste does using a Dexcom produce?,"I've been out of the loop and I'm learning about the Dexcom for the first time.

In exploring their site I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=96&amp;v=s6aFY_wffhs) that shows how you need to replace the transmitter every 3 months. They show the actor scanning the barcode on this big box that I can only assume contained a brand new applicator (I guess with a built-in sensor) and transmitter. 

So do you basically need to have this big box *and* a new applicator mailed to you every three months?

I'm hoping I'm wrong and you just need to get a new transmitter while having one applicator you reuse, because getting a new one every three months seems very wasteful. It's one thing that's always bugged me about the pump and I know plastic waste is pervasive in the medical industry in general (and often for good reason of course) but I'd rather not produce a bunch of waste if I can help it.",diabetes_t1,1564087492,Erilis000,23,2,True,2019-07-25

CGM spike theory,"I have a theory I want to bounce off of you awesome folks.  I believe that my Libre drastically over estimates the size of spikes when they happen quickly, causing me to over correct. 

Example - https://i.imgur.com/yw2vYra.jpg

That was yesterday, where I forgot my insulin while out with my family. I had an unhealthy lunch and then came home to dose. That spike was at 12.6 and rising, in theory that means I need 12 units to correct (or more depending on how high it’ll rise).

Instead, I did the carb count on my lunch and went with 7 units. That should only bring me down by 4.9, but it should have been enough to cover my lunch. 

Sure enough, ended up slightly low. That spike on the Libre was no where near where I actually was in real life. This isn’t the first time either - fast spikes seem to end up in lows quite often. 

I’ve done corrections where I’ve been at a sustained 12 and my math is usually pretty close, so I believe that this spike wasn’t true.

Complication development rate of high blood sugar vs low blood sugar.,"Hello.

I’m just up late and thinking and reading online, but one thing I’m curious about is the rate at which complications will develop as a result of high blood sugar or low blood sugar. 

From my understanding, it can generally take a few years for complications of high blood sugar to become noticeable. I am also aware that frequent low blood sugar levels can lead to impaired brain functioning. Do the complications of low levels develop faster than the complications of highs? That is, assuming that it’s  a person who is chronically high and a person who is chronically low. 

I’ve had way more lows than normal (11 in the past 2 weeks, I am also at the end of my first trimester of pregnancy), but I had uncontrolled high blood sugar (waking up with fasting levels of 400+) for about a year after initial  (mis)diagnosis in 2018. I haven’t noticed any adverse effects of the high blood sugar at all, it developed rapidly. October 2017 I was a 5.7 a1c and by May of 2018 I had shot up to an 11.5. I’m sure that 25 lows in the past 90 days hasn’t completely destroyed parts of my brain, especially considering that not all of them have been severe lows, I’m just wondering how this all develops. I’m new to type 1 &amp; diabetes in general! 

TLDR; do chronically high BG levels and chronically low BG levels have a similar rate/length of time that complications develop? Does one usually develop faster than the other?",diabetes_t1,1563873809,psy_chic333,4,3,True,2019-07-23

Omnipod opinions,"I’ve been diabetic for over a year now and I have a Dexcom CGM, which I love, pry it from my cold, dead, sweet fingers, and it’s telling me that life could be just that much easier if I just could get a handle on this food intake/insulin thing.  I have bad teeth which limits what I can eat and an incredibly small stomach which was used to eating casually through the day, grazing like a tiny cow.  I take insulin in half units sometimes because my sensitivity goes up and down with my reproductive cycle, which isn’t THAT reliable so I could wake up on the 15th one month and be insulin resistant but the next month be very sensitive.  This period (lol) lasts an undetermined amount of time.

To make matters even worse, I have a math disability called dyscalculia which is just dyslexia for math problems and so I have trouble, even with help, calculating my boluses anyway and nearly always undershoot, leading to stacking. I have trouble with how much I think I’ll eat vs what I’ll actually eat (take 4 chicken strips, I will eat 2-3 of them) and screw up my bolus that way too.

My job is active and spontaneously hard, I could be sitting on my butt for hours just waiting or I could be in continuous motion for HOURS. I tend to want to run a little high at work since I never know when I’ll be moving nonstop where if I say “no” that’s money out of my pocket. 

What’s having the Pod like? Does it take any guesswork out of this? I feel like I’m going to kill myself accidentally one day and it won’t even be because of bad math, it’ll be fear that I’ll fuck it up and the apathy will kill me. I won’t be able to come awake to give myself insulin during the night because I already find that I’ve thrown my receiver across the room when it gives HI alarm. Low sugar brings me awake instantly below 70 but highs just get ignored. Sometimes I’ll level out at 175 but if I try to correct with even a half unit without also eating a carb, which I may not be hungry for, and so I just wait until it climbs to 200 and I feel safe. This could be hours.

I don’t take a lot of insulin. Maybe total of 20 units including basal on a bad day. Yeah I know.  

Would you get a pod if you were me? I know that managing this thing is something we do only to the best of our abilities, would this help someone like me? My endo’s nurse can’t stop singing the praises and said I should try the saline pod but my needs aren’t as great as some of the people who have been diabetic a lot longer or have passed their honeymoon period. I feel like I’m being treated the same as someone who needs 40 units in a day and I have to keep reminding people that I’m less than 100lbs. Would a pod just be wasted on me?

I’m just looking for opinions from other diabetics, I’m not going to base my decision off what I read here, I’m already going to try it, maybe I’m just looking for validation or someone to properly chide me, I don’t know. Maybe just give me your own experience and I can see if some of the little parts of it are something I’m missing.

Confused Long Term Highs,"Hello Fellow T1s,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been T1 for a few years now after a DX in 2016. I was on MDI Novolog 3-10U w/meals and Basaglar 26U nightly for most of that and got my hbA1C from 13.5 to 7.5 in under a year. Last year I switched to a Tandem / Dexcom combo and was really happy with it at first. I had struggled with MDI, having lows every other week or so and feeling like I just had too little control over all. On the pump initially I was using about 50U a day. I wasn't having lows anymore, things seemed great. A few months went by and I started to gain weight and my insulin needs increased. At some point I got sick and couldn't get my BG under 300, so I raised my basal, it did the trick, my BG came back into normal range and once I was over my illness it stayed in normal range at that level. Then a few months go by and I'm struggling to keep my BG down below 300 again, I increase my basal, it works and I do okay for a little while. It's a year on now. my basal is at 2, I've gained 50LBS, and I'm struggling again to get my BG to stay in line. I'm using 70-100U a day. My pump holds 300U so I'm switching my sites every three days. I get swelling at the sites and leakage when I remove them so I played around with the idea that this is a reaction to the plastic cannula or that they're too short, or that I'm injecting too much and ruining the sites. I've tried split dosing, early dosing, new sites. Nothing really helps. Any ideas? My endo didn't seem super concerned by the weight gain or the increases in insulin needs. hbA1C has jumped to 8.5, I get this acetone breath sometimes that worries me, and I hate that I'm even more out of control now than before spending thousands of dollars on this frustrating technology. I know that some of the wight gain is my own fault for eating carbs maybe I shouldn't have here or there. I was overweight at DX, but happy with my body, I've gone from over weight to fat, how do I lose weight with such high BG? I know exercise will bring it down some, but when I get it under control wont I have to eat in order to exercise? I hate T1, I miss my life before DX, I love my pump and freedom it's brought me from daily injections, but I feel constantly like I need to go back to MDI in order to prevent long term damage.

Rant- Drivers License Issues,"I went to the DMV last week to renew my drivers license and found out that my drivers license was suspended in 2016 for non-completion of medical review paperwork.  The problem was that they sent the paperwork to an old college address (never listed on my driver's license) more than a year after I moved out so I never received it.  I called the office to ask for an extension and was told that, because I was outside of the 30 day window, they could not grant one but I would be reinstated as soon as they received my paperwork.  Well, I dropped the forms off at my endocrinologist's office and sent a quick message explaining my situation and asking her to send the paperwork as quickly as possible. I received a garbled message from one of her nurses saying they'd pass the info along to my endo. Well I called the DMV this afternoon (6 days after dropping off the paperwork) and they haven't received anything yet. I just sent another message to my endo to follow up.

Doctors have told me my management is excellent.

Since I was 14 though my A1c has hovered around 6.5 but only through really hard work.
Recently I found out I have carpal tunnel that was likely caused by poor management as a kid.
I also have a fair few other physical conditions and food intolerances which is making management hell.

I really wish people would be more considerate of “food policing”,"My wedding was on Wednesday and I had a GREAT time, my family and best friend came in from out of state and my husbands family were there and it was fantastic. But several times over the few days they were visiting, my mother would “food police” me. She knows I’m type 1, even though I was recently diagnosed so maybe she doesn’t know much about it. But several times she would say “can you eat that?” And one time I mentioned going to a candy store and she straight up said “you can’t have that.” I said I can have whatever I want, I have insulin. And SHE seemed offended (we have a rocky history to begin with but that’s a long and different story.)

I’m pregnant and the cravings are hard and I’m having complications (with my body, not the baby) that have me needing to rest and not exert myself.

Childhood regrets?,"Warning: LONG WINDED BUT RELEVANT

I'm 36 years old, female, and have been type 1 diabetic for 29 years (diagnosed at age 7, February 1990). I'm located in the state of Georgia in the USA. I'm using R and NPH insulins at the moment simply because of finances and no health insurance, given with injection only. I test my blood sugar on average 10 times per day. My A1C is 4.7, I have no idea how much I weigh but I'm in a size 12 pants in women's sizing. I started trying to get healthier a couple of years ago, and at that point I was in a size 28. I had allowed my weight to get out of hand and allowed myself to not believe I was capable of working out both because of my size and because of my previous injuries (8 broken places in my spine, 2 in my ankle, 1 in my wrist all from a car accident in 2010). I use tylenol or excedrin for pain, and phenylephrine for allergies. I am also an occasional cigar and cannabis smoker (once a week at most), and a very occasional drinker (once a month at most).

Since 2017, I cleaned up my act, started taking better care of myself and lost a bunch of weight. I started with diet changes and moved into walking, which changed to running and taking kickboxing classes. Before, when I was much larger, I didn't have a problem with this. However, now that I've lost so much weight and kinda sorta have a waist again, I'm noticing that I have an area that just WON'T BUDGE when it comes to weight loss.

It's in the middle of my stomach, and it's where I gave my insulin injections for years. It's not the same texture as fat (or the loose/extra skin I have since the weightloss) on my body, but more like a softer scar tissue? It isn't a cyst or anything like that. I'm wondering if it could be the result of injecting there frequently over the years? My doctor told me when I was a child that multiple injections in the same place could cause scar tissue, but that was when I was only using an area about the size of a quarter, so I branched out to a larger area (basically the area I have now that seems like soft scar tissue).

Need to upgrade pump: Dealing with Minimed and the 670G system,"First, some context: I am a 27-year-old female T1 diabetic. I've had T1 since I was 2 years old, so essentially it is just part of my life. Current A1C is 6.8, am using a Medtronic PARADIGM™ 530G and Dexcom G6 CGM. Paradigm is now out of warranty, and conveniently failed at the beginning of the month, so I am currently on a Minimed loaner Paradigm.  


I guess this is more of a vent of dealing with Minimed and also looking for advice of how to deal with them in the future given my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**First call to Minimed:** Unfortunately, my insurance United Healthcare is pals with Minimed and won't let me go for the t Slim x2 like I wanted. So I am stuck with upgrading with Minimed yet again. Since getting the loaner pump they have been blowing up my phone, texting me, calling me, emailing me, and CALLING MY MOM to upgrade my pump. This is while I'm looking at my options (surprise, Lol, United gives you none!) and maybe a week after receiving the loaner (you get a 3 month period with it before you get slapped with a charge). 

&amp;#x200B;

I get back to them and the woman I'm working with says ""Oh by the way, your phone goes straight to voicemail."" YES, because you've left me 2 messages today! Anyways... I give them my insurance info, they tell me they will check with my insurance to make sure the pump is covered, I say okay, and assume they will get back to me to let me know what is covered. Surprise again! I just get an email saying that I owe nothing (good) and that the pump in the shipping queue...So guess I am stuck with it. Fine, whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Second call to Minimed:** I'm a little upset to see that the pump is in the shipping queue without them talking to me first and I just re-upped on Dexcom G6 supplies and Minimed wants to send the Guardian sensor to me either A.) When the warranty on the G6 runs out (3 months; the first associate wanted me to get back to them with the dates of expiration so they could send the Guardian out after), or according to this second call associate, B.) They want to pay me $200 to switch immediately and I would pay $100 out of pocket for the Guardian. This associate is pressing me to take option and saying they don't like to ship the pump and sensor separately. I convince him that to just send the pump and say I'll get back to them with the date of expiration because no way am I paying $100 for the Guardian after just paying $100 for the Dexcom refill. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The real issue:** I don't want the Guardian sensor, just the pump. I want to continue treatment with the Dexcom G6 which I have used since October and love. I have had the CGM Minimed put out with the Paradigm (little over 4 years ago) and absolutely hated it... Waking up in the middle of the night to deal with incorrect readings, calibrating constantly, the sensor kinking under my skin, the list goes on and on. I see that other people are STILL having these issues with the Guardian 3 and I don't trust it enough to relay info to the pump that will change my insulin rates. No thanks, don't want to be stuck with a subpar product for a year when I have the best luck with the G6. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you convince MiniMed that you DO NOT want the Guardian sensor and will use the pump in its basic functions? I really just want an insulin pump. They can't force me to take the Guardian, right? Do I reaaaaallly have to go to training for the pump and CGM? Does anyone have positive experience with the Guardian sensor, or have had both the G6 and Guardian? 

  


**Tl;dr** How do you deal with Minimed pressing you to get the Guardian sensor when you absolutely don't want it and are happy with the Dexcom and using the 670G pump? Does anyone have similar experiences?",diabetes_t1,1563637962,kellwich,10,2,True,2019-07-20

Unpredictable responses to insulin- PLEASE HELP,"Hello everyone. I could really use some advice as this is getting very dire. 

My boyfriend is T1, we have been dating for 5 years and live together. He was diagnosed when he was 10, he is 22 now. He uses Medtronic 670G, and Humolog. 

For the last 2 months diabetes has been taking a huge toll on both of our lives and we are reaching out to any help possible. 

Basically, he is having extremely unpredictable reactions to his insulin. During the school year (September 2018 to May 2019) he ate the same food everyday for the most part-due to it being easy. He would have the same amount of cheerios for breakfast, pasta for lunch, and pasta for dinner. Obvioisly some days would be a bit different but honestly, he was very ritualistic about it. This would usually be around 300+ carbs a day. His insulin was pretty regular and his bg was predictable. He would have lows at night sometimes but honestly it wasnt bad. At that time he was using the freestyle libre and his bg was pretty good.

Since march he has been using medtronic cgm, mostly on auto-mode but has been forced to come off auto mode because it was exasperating the issues hes having.

In the last 2 months, his bg would NOT be predictable at all. He has dropped a ton of weight now because he cant eat many carbs due to his fear of lows and highs. 

Heres the problem: for exampel, he will eat a sandwich (25 carbs) and one day it will cause his bg to drop very low, but the next day it will rise very very high. 

His doctor seems to be stumped too.

Here are my possible theories, PLEASE let me know if there are things we havent thought of.

1. Thyroid / hormone problem
2. Second puberty?
3. Insulin pockets/resistance building
4. Humolog no longer works for him maybe? He has never used any other kind.
5. stress is causing unpredictable bg
6. The weightloss is causing a cycle of having different insulin needs (altough doesnt explain the day to day differences)

His bg will literally change 10+ points both ways, even when eating the same food and the same amount of insulin. 

Has anyone ever experienced this? It is causing extreme distress as he is afraid to eat any food. I really appreciate any feedback. He will be seeing his doctor again on tuesday and we want to come with as much info as possible.",diabetes_t1,1563671372,HoneyBeanP,17,5,True,2019-07-20

Insurance question: Amount billed is much larger than amount paid by insurance + coinsurance... Why?,"We just got a new Tandem pump (YAY!) and the amount billed was $7495. Our insurance paid $3940.20 and we paid $437.80 for a total of $4378. That is a difference of (7495-4378) = $3117. 

There was some question on if the pump was going to be covered at all, and the Tandem rep said if we had to pay out of pocket it was going to be $4378, so the price was clearly always going to be $4378.

How I saved my T1D boyfriends life..,"-here’s why you should have your partners dexcom app downloaded on your phone as well-

So here’s how the morning went: I was in my quiet 8 am (Anatomy) class then my phone starts blaring the emergency alert that my boyfriend was low. Everyone looked at me like I was insane but I’ve never heard it beep at me like that either. I click on the alert and it says he’s at LOW. I’ve never seen it just say “LOW” so I panicked &amp; called him/FaceTimed him to see if it was a mistake. He wouldn’t answer after like 5 calls, now here’s where my worry starts to kick in. 

Oddly my best friend who sits next to me in class’s boyfriend also has T1D so now here we are both panicking on if my boyfriend is even alive not focusing on class until we knew he was okay. At this point I’m about to call his sister or mom to go check on if he’s dead or even seizing in his bed(I think of the worst outcomes). FINALLY after 10 min of calling him he hears the vibrations of my calls and he calls me back asking what was wrong...

When he woke up he said he felt super low then immediately ate a lot of food and was trying to figure out why his own phone didn’t make any noise to alert him how low he got. Ladies and gentlemen.. His phone was still connected to his blue tooth headphones playing all the alerts through those hence why he couldn’t hear. If I never got that notification who knows how low he would’ve got without waking up - or worse, what could’ve happened to him.

Does your basal rate profile have peeks and valleys?,"So I just started on Omnipod. Diabetes nurses (not doctor) asked me whether I want to start with a flat basal rate or use the so called Renner schema, which has two peaks and valleys. Not seeing any reasons to overcomplicate things, I said that I'd prefer to start with a flat baseline, which they apparently weren't happy about.
First day went alright a little falling in the evening, a little rise in the early morning.
I come in at 11am and they then proceed to tell me that they want to switch to the Renner schema.

Here is an image https://m.imgur.com/a/t825Bhs

So they responded to a slight rise in the morning by doubling the rate in the early morning and a shallow drop in the evening by increasing the rate by about 50%. Seems a bit radical to me. In my opinion, they didn't even look at how they day went, they just flipped the table on me because they liked their approach better. They argued that the drop in the evening was just because of the levemir i previously used was still active, although i reduced it by 50% and had a low temp basal to compensate for the remainder, all according to their instructions. 

Needless to say I dropped like a brick after the two peaks.

What do you think about this? I doubt that anyones basal rate converges to something like this, does the shape of yours look anything like this?",diabetes_t1,1563437888,JeyJeyKing,8,3,True,2019-07-18

9.5 year honeymoon phase - anyone else have extremely long honeymoon?,"Hi everyone.  I'm new here.  A little backstory, I was diagnosed new years eve of 2009 with T1D and a blood glucose level of 600 something.   I was hospitalized for a few days and then got things under control with insulin.  I was only on insulin for about 1 month and kept getting hypo so was pulled off it and told I was in my honeymoon phase and that it would last most likely 6 mos, max 2 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

Well I got to 2 years and kept right on chugging along, to the point where my doc thought maybe I was misdiagnosed and that I perhaps just had a virus in 2009 that made my antibody count high at that time. A1C's crept up gradually from 5.3 to 6.8 the last many years and I had been taking metformin for the past 3-4 years, thinking perhaps I was a T2 as a result to some insult to my pancreas.  

Fast forward and my last 2 A1C's increased pretty dramatically to 7.8 and then 9.  Last couple week's met twice with new endo who redid antibody test and C-peptide.  She said antibody counts over 5 indicates no doubt T1, and the test measures up to 250 and I was over that.  C-peptide was 0.78, which she said under 1 is no doubt T1.  

&amp;#x200B;

So it seems that I was indeed diagnosed correctly back in 2009, but just had an incredibly long honeymoon phase (which I'm grateful for, obv), but I just wondered if any of you have had such a long honeymoon phase?  All the docs and NPs in the endo group I visit have never seen anything close to that.

T1D LADA and currently researched to find a cure,"Hello! I saw interesting stories here and I wanted to post about myself some day. Now is that day (and my first post here on Reddit!).

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 years ago I heard that I have T1D LADA (Latent Auto-immune Diabetes in Adults). A half a year after I joined a research to stop the process which causes T1D to appear. They injected me with an experimental medicine (or placebo) last year and blood samples are taken frequently to see what the results are.

&amp;#x200B;

The longer version:

About 8-10 years ago (\~2010) a doctor tested me and my sugar level was a bit high. After a few months I had another test but he said there was nothing wrong. I am sure things were already starting back then.

In those years I had from time to time lack of energy and often felt confused why. But then: 2017. I was abnormally tired for 2 weeks straight and I couldn't recover my energy. I visited the doctor and luckily he saw my blood sugar results were 'at the edge'. He discovered I was not Type 2 since I had many symptoms for T1D Lada, examples: Quite skinny, another Auto-Immune Disease (Vitiligo), close family member exactly the same and me being already adult. He tested me 2 more times and showed me I had undoubtedly T1D LADA... Hooray!

I am glad it was discovered early and I was able to wait 6 months(!) before my first injection (long-acting) insulin 2 units a day. Shortly after I joined the T1D research, as it was my only chance of doing something about it! The research was quite intensive but it went very well. 

&amp;#x200B;

The current situation:

\- I use 9 units of long-acting insulin daily (and recently I even had a minor hypo because I delayed eating food). 

\- I changed to a low-carb diet (based on LCHF) and since then I can eat without testing and not using short-acting insulin. I never felt this good and way more energetic with very stable sugar levels! Before this diet I was using about 10 long-acting and 10 short-acting insulin every day.

\- I am done with the medicine injections for the research but they still test me frequently on my progress. The last test results shows that my body still produce and even increase my insulin production when ingesting carbs! Next test results will be in 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to summarize it as much as possible. Feel free to ask questions about my research, the LCHF diet or anything!",diabetes_t1,1563475419,maniactha,4,1,True,2019-07-18

Newly Diagnosed- A tad bit overwhelmed,"HALP THE NEWBIE! I was just recently diagnosed at the beginning of June.  DKA, few days in ICU, you know the drill.  The diabetes educator who came to my room in the hospital was less than stellar but I think I've read every message board, blog, etc about T1D since then.  I have kept a very detailed journal logging every single blood sugar check, insulin dose, and meal for 6 weeks.  I was checking my blood sometimes more than 10 times per day (always morning, before breakfast, two hours after, before lunch, two hours after, before dinner, two hours after, and before bed).  I had my first follow up with my endocrinologist last week.  I asked him a bunch of questions I had written down but in general, he was very laid back and just kept telling me I was doing fine.  I did get a Dexcom which has just furthered my obsessive nature, I think.

Since the day I got home from the hospital, I have eaten on average no more than 35g carbs/day (never more than 50).  Yes, I eat a lot of the same stuff.  I wasn't told a carb to insulin ratio (in the hospital or at my follow up) rather just do ""16 units of Tresiba in the morning, 4 units of insulin before each meal).  If I was in the 80's and eating a meal that only had 10 carbs, I didn't think 4 units was necessary so I backed it down to 2.  According to my endo, my insulin sensitivity factor should be 81. There is just no way this is possible.  I can take a unit of insulin and it will literally do nothing to my blood sugar.  

For example, today for lunch I ate approximately 7 carbs (literally lettuce, tomato, and turkey). I took 3 units of insulin and even pre-bolused.  If my sensitivity factor truly is 81, I should have dropped drastically, right?  I started at 98 and two hours later was at 87.  I wanted to eat a snack at 6:30pm before I traveled back home (not by plane- I know that can cause issues).  My blood sugar was 94, I took 2 units of insulin and ate a little cheese (0 carbs!).  You would expect a drop, right?  Two hours later I was at 84.  Then it's dinner time.  I know I'm not supposed to stack insulin but clearly I have no idea what I'm doing.  Dinner is 5 carbs.  My blood sugar was at 94, I take two units, and eat my 5 carbs.  Here I am two hours later, 114!  Is it the protein or fat that is raising my blood sugar? I KNOW these are not drastic numbers.  That's not what I'm concerned about.  I don't know how I'm supposed to make these dosage calls when the numbers aren't lining up with what my endo has told me. 

I'm eating very simple foods- a lot of lettuce wraps, meat, vegetables, eggs, almonds.  Nothing processed.  Literally haven't eaten a single piece of bread, candy, not an ounce of sugar, cracker, rice, pasta- nothing!

I don't know if I'm injecting wrong, am I resistant (c peptide was practically 0 so not T2), what am I doing wrong!? I don't even know what I'd do if I ate a meal that had a lot of carbs.  I know this isn't black and white and I'm being too OCD and trying to ""make it make sense"".  But I can't believe that everyone with T1D is just winging it like this.

Triggered by someone's anecdotal story.,"Hey all, I need to get my frustration out. Although I understand that how irrationally irritated I get with strangers not understanding the difference between T1 and T2, I am still working on not letting it bother me. Today, I mostly succeeded.

Went to my normal breakfast stop, and the drive through was a little backed up. I decided to use the wait time to test my sugar and bolus for my breakfast, as my office was just a block down the street. The cars moved on quicker than I had expected. The lady working the window (L) kind of popped her head out the window to see where her next car was. I slowly pulled forward as I threw my lancet and strips back in my purse. My meter was sitting in my lap. She chuckled asking if I was putting on my makeup. I laughed and responded, no testing my sugars.

L: oh! Is it okay?! Do you need juice?! 
Me: nope, it's actually in a good range. Thank you though. 
L: Is that an insulin pump? 
Me: yes. 
L: oh that's pretty cool. My husband had diabetes, but then he got gastric bypass, and now he doesn't! He had to be off his meds for 2 weeks before the surgery because it could affect the surgery. 
Me: internal eye roll as she is clearly suggesting my problems could all be solved through this surgery... P. S. I've lost 30 lbs in the last 5 months and I'm 40 lbs away from my goal. 

I ended up congratulating her husband's success and went on my merry way without chewing her out. I have to remember that when you're not living this disease, you probably don't know everything about it. Still annoying, but I'm proud I kept my freak out in.

Running regularly greatly improved blood sugars but...,"I run a few miles daily, Monday through Friday, then I take Saturday and Sunday off as rest days. During the week my blood sugars are rock solid. I rarely ever get a high blood sugar and just an occasional but easily manageable low (lows don't bother me nearly as much).

Then the weekend rolls around. I'm fine for the most part on Saturday, although I might get a slight high blood sugar in the middle of the night, but then Sunday and all day Monday (before I go on my run) I'll often get multiple blood sugar spikes. As in I do everything normal but for some reason I'll wake up 300 or I'll be 300 after I eat lunch.

It's like after the second day of no running, my body decides I won't be getting exercise anymore and then just starts liver dumping. I don't get it, but it almost makes all the weekly exercise pointless because then it causes out of control rollercoasters on the weekend.

**There are no alcohol or diet changes over the weekend. The only difference is I'm not going on a run.**

Does anybody know why this is or how to get a grip on this situation?

TLDR:  Exercise is helping my blood sugars, but then when I take a couple rest days, which is necessary, my body rebels against me.",diabetes_t1,1563219847,GoodWorms,14,8,True,2019-07-15

Time to vent! Freestyle customer service.,"I just got off the phone with Freestyle Customer Service (in US) to see if I could get a replacement sensor due to having to remove one early to get MRI on an emergency basis (which was normal, btw). They said they do not replace sensors under this circumstance because they have already informed customers that sensors cannot be worn during MRIs. They also went on to suggest that next time I need an MRI to make sure it's scheduled at the end of the sensors time since they will not replace it. 

I'M SO ANGRY! These things are not cheap and I was not expecting to end up in the emergency room or getting an MRI. Plus I think it's ridiculous that you are expected to schedule diagnostic imaging around the time your sensor is set to expire as if you have a ton of control over scheduling when these tests should be done. 

So to basically reiterate what they said: need an emergency brain scan? Schedule it for when your sensor is expiring or get ready for 10 days of fingersticks until you can get your next months prescription.

Random question came to mind: anyone else have to go through the lantus/insulin transition when getting a pump?,"I remember when I went and got my first pump about 11 or 12 years ago, when I was in 8th grade, I had to stay off lantus and I believe humalog (can't remember) for 24 hours prior since they didn't want me dropping too fast once I got on it and man did it suck. I remember walking around, with that punch to the stomach/whole body ache like DKA feeling cause I'm pretty sure I was close to it, especially since I was pretty consistently bouncing around on my blood sugar from super low (30s-60s) to super high (400s-500s) while on said lantus/insulin. I remember having to put in my first medtronic injector, one where you had to manually press it down into you with the inserter each one came with, and freaking out due to the size of the needle. It definitely hurt, and still hurts on occasion but it's better with newer inserters/pumps and adjusting to it over time, but man was this thing a life changer. I was just wondering, does every diabetic have to go through that if you make the transition or is it easier now a days?

I feel like something is wrong when everything is supposedly right...,"I’ve just joined this sub today as I’m newly diagnosed and I’ve noticed a lot of frustration from people dealing with their blood sugar. Comments and posts mentioning their blood sugar levels skyrocketing and diving at random times for no reason.

Ironically this somewhat worries me as my blood sugar levels are pretty much always in range at this point only a little more than a month after being diagnosed. Not only this but I’m only 15 years old and have heard that puberty messes up sugar levels a lot.

I don’t own a CGM and I really only test my blood at breakfast, lunch, and dinner or if I’m feeling low (which it never is). I’m giving pretty much all my insulin after my meals instead of before like I should. I don’t even know the difference between bolus and basal insulin and what they’re for.

All of this feels like some dumb routine like tying your shoes or brushing your teeth and that maybe this will just all go away soon. 

I guess the point of this post is to ask if I should be more worried about all of this. Even if my results are in range 90% of the time? Yes I realize that blood sugar levels can change at any time but even when I’m super hungry or exercising they’ve still been in range. Should I be doing a better job at taking care of myself? Is it normal for my blood sugar levels to be so “normal” only a month after diagnosis? Why should I take insulin before a meal if my blood sugar will only be high until my insulin kicks in 15 minuets later?

Help! Insurance coverage question!,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

I recently changed jobs and with that, my husband and I changed insurance plans. To my surprise, I called to check on his first order of insulin on the new plan to find out that 

1. It had never been ordered and there was no trigger apparently to inform us his RX wasn't going to be filled, and more importantly,

2. My new plan does not cover the type of insulin he uses (Humalog).

He has been using Humalog for 20 years and also recently transitioned to using a CGM, which is working well but was a rocky transition, so he is not interested in trying a different type of insulin that is covered under the plan.

I do have other coverage options, which I am eligible to switch to next plan year, and I am going to check with these if they cover Humalog and if so, switch for next year or possibly talk to HR about any option to switch sooner. One is an HSA plan which I am seeing as my last resort because if I have to pay OOP, at least I could do it pre-tax.

In the meantime, do I have any other options besides paying out of pocket? I've read a minimal amount about doctors being able to specifically request/require certain drugs, but not sure if anyone has had any success with this.

A sensor is out of the question as $100 every two weeks is not affordable for us. 
The doctors are zero help, I actually changed his units myself because he was low all day every day and the doctor said after blood work but we wouldn't live like that no more.

WTF am I doing wrong with my G6?,"I've had the last 3 go bad on me. One of them without ever warming up. I'm new to the G6, and after 4 years of G4 sensor perfection (never had one go bad in first 7 days), i'm a little discouraged.

I've been a tSlim user for 2-3 months now, and really like the G6's near-perfect accuracy. the suspend function on the tSlim has kept me alive and sleeping very well. I love the system....when it works.

The last 3 sensors stopped without any notification. Just.....stopped. One minute I have a data stream, next time I look, nothing. Just a trend line gap. No notifications, no alarms, no notices of any kind. The CGM History just says ""Sensor Stopped"" and the time. Like i pressed the 'stop' button. One sensor lasted 4 days, another died during warm-up (that one did give me a 'failure' error), and this last one another 2 days. First 2 were in my arm, and was the first time i've put them there. the last one was in my stomach where I've been wearing the G6 for 2 months problem-free and used the G4 for 4 years without a hitch. I'd like to give the arm another try and rest my gut, but.....maybe not.

The situations where they failed have no commonality. Once out walking, once sitting reading to my kid before bedtime, and once out eating.

2 different Lots.

I do not use the Dexcom iPhone app. It's been on my phone, and occasionally hooked into the sensor, but my Bluetooth is usually off. That's because with the tSlim, i'm getting double notifications. There is no real gain to using the app, I'll just download the data manually. But it would lock onto it a few times a day, randomly. I do not think that cycle impacted this.

I gently brush the applicator pad in Mastisol prior to insertion. But i'm careful to not get it around the wire or insertion site itself. there should be no impact or effect from it.

FWIW, I tried to 'restart' them a variety of ways, even by putting my tSlim in a Faraday bag for a couple of hours. No use. the sensors were dead.

This is frustrating as shit. Dexcom agreed to send me new ones, but still, this is no way to manage care. I'm about to go back to the G5 and just use my phone. The suspend on the tSlim works great, but i'll just set alarms and wake myself (and my wife) up again. the endless cycle of calling customer support to get replacements filled is cumbersome and annoying. The G4 worked perfectly for 4 years (and up to 17 days at a time..). I cannot believe this is an improvement.

I read the posts, and know I'm not alone with sensor failures. Reddit users are a small part of the overall T1 community, so I can only imagine the failure rate of these things. But still, 3 in a row? from different lots? The math makes it improbable. I feel like i'm doing something wrong.

If anyone has any history like this and identified an issue with the tSlim or G6 that i'm missing, please let me know.",diabetes_t1,1562894499,seaelbee,3,2,True,2019-07-11

I need advice on getting my A1C down.,"I am going to give you a little background. I was diagnosed with diabetes at 17, about 5 years ago. I was misdiagnosed by my old doctor with type 2, he out me on metphormin and told me to lose weight. I dropped 20 pounds and came back 3 months later and my A1C went was 11. He upped my dose and had me take it 3 times a day and I ended up refusing to take it after another month of it because I was just puking every time I took it. I went back another 3 months and had dropped 30 pounds from what I'm assuming was my body killing itself because my A1C went up to 15. He then put me on insulin and refused to test me for type 1 when my mother asked him to. He said I was too old to develop it. I was only taking lantus. My A1C then went back to 11 after another 3 months. He retired and I had to find a new doctor.

She tests me for type 1 and sure enough I'm type 1. She changes everything. She puts me on novolog and lantus. I was able to get my A1C down to 7.5. I then found out that since I was taking care of myself and had my own healthcare I could get financial aid for a pump. So I got a pump.

I've had the pump for a year now and I cannot get my A1C below 7 and I'm so frustrated. I've tried the keto diet.

Maybe others have faced it before and multiple times so I can't really measure how important this is. Anyway, Ima cut straight to the chase.

So food is not related to this. Ive tried to explain it otherwise, like the fact that Ive been on a diet for like 20 days and lost 3 kilos (yet again i crossed that off, as being on a carb diet only causes your levels to be low, not high). Also I do not think I am stressed or something as I am on vacation (just finished high school yay) and on my way to my island. One thing that might be the answer to this is the fact that I lowered my basal from 22 to 18 (summer) (not all of a sudden, 1 unit every 2 days) and perhaps this might have caused it, so I reverted it back to 22 (again 1 up per 2 days) for 5 days now.

A1C down to 6.4!!,"This is my first reddit post, I just had to share this.

So i was diagnosed as type 1 in April, a couple days after my 19th birthday. My blood sugar was 440 and my A1C was 14.

I just got my test results back and it's down to 6.4!! I'm so happy! It feels good to see that I have this under control, even when it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

It really helped that I got a freestyle libre like 3 weeks after I was diagnosed. I live in Germany btw so everything is paid for by my insurance.

Type 1 Diabetes Project," 

Hey,

hope you are doing good!

As I have a lot of relatives with diabetes in my family, I really appreciate openness and courage for living with diabetes. Sharing the experience with diabetes is so important. But there is still a lot to improve to make the life of people living with diabetes type 1 easier. That's why I joined xbird.

xbird is a medical AI company and we are now developing a project to avoid hypoglycemic events in diabetes type 1 patients. For that, we need data to train our algorithm.

For 21 days of CGM and insulin data, we reward you with a 150 EUR Amazon voucher.

Would you like to participate in our project?

Omnipod post site change hyperglycemia,"I was wondering if anyone else has a problem and their strategies to mitigate hyperglycemia after changing out the omnipod. I swear for the first 6ish hours nothing happens for me and I've heard of people:  
 
* Leaving the old pod on for those 6 hours to prevent old site leaking  
* 1U or so bolus up front on the new pod  
* Huge temp basal on the new pod for a few hours  
* Fill the new pod with old school syringes since it's easier to get the bubbles out  
* Fill the pod vertically  
* Prime the pod vertically  
  
Right now I do all but anything giving me more insulin up front because that is too risky IMO. With all those steps I can usually keep myself under 200 mg/dl but really I'd like to not be going out of range every 2-3 days due to pump issues.",diabetes_t1,1562596991,BabyThatsMyJam2,11,2,True,2019-07-08

How do you know when the honeymoon is over?,"How do you know when the honeymoon is over?

I started having burnout and stopped testing my blood sugar and started making some bad food choices. I still ate low carb about 80% of the time but allowed myself some indulgences.

"Issues with site infections, lack of insulin absorption","Hi there, my partner doesn’t use reddit so I’m posting on her behalf. Lately she’s been having issues with her pump sites getting inflected which is having an effect on the absorption of her insulin. This started happening more frequently after she started taking acutane but I don’t think the two are related. The only thing I can think of though is acutane causes issues with healing... T1D causes issues with healing, and the insulin is getting stuck just under the skin causing a buildup and quicker infection. That’s just a guess though. 

Understandably this is causing her frustration and stress. Usually her sites are good for three days but lately after one or two days they become inflamed, red, swollen and infected. She’s running out of places to use as sites and when she uses anywhere but her stomach her sites tend to last a day max. I’m worried because her last A1C was higher then normal.

What I’m trying to get at is I suppose I hate that we have to deal with above mentioned comments, as well as not being treated and taken care of as of as serious a disease this is because they think it’s just T2 and it’s my own fault because I can’g put the fork. &amp; knife down. In some ways I actually agree with that logic to an extent - I very rarely see any T2’s that aren’t or weren’t fairly overweight in the past.

Well, congratulation on having a partially working pancreas, and not needing to have a pump or keep insulin on you at all time. That must be really nice. I'm glad you think the occasional insulin injection in the bathroom isn't inconvenient. I guess you forgot that not only are there Type II diabetics more dependent on insulin than you seem to be, but there is a *whole other type of diabetes* that is 100% insulin dependent. Who have to either wear pumps, or give insulin injections upward of 5 times a day.

What about a mother with a young T1 son? Do they leave their food at the table and hide in the bathroom (men's or women's?) so she can help him inject? And what if we offend those poor restaurant patrons in the bathroom trying to wash their hands, who have to see someone give insulin next to them at the counter?

&gt;I’m sorry you have diabetes. I’m sorry your child has diabetes.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry my uninformed opinion — about a man in a restaurant who was checking his blood sugar and administering life-saving insulin before his meal — was hurtful. I was unaware. I was not being intentionally hateful.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m repenting for my mistake by using what happened as a teaching moment to help raise awareness about this cruel disease, [**as many on Twitter hoped I would**](https://twitter.com/Diabetes_DRI/status/1146780153420402694). Please know, I wasn’t intentionally trying to perpetuate misinformation. Please understand, my views reflected a lack of understanding about this incurable disease. That is why my comment struck a nerve and went viral. I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry I didn’t understand anything about Type 1 diabetes (T1D), which often occurs in children. Those with diabetes have a pancreas that does not make enough insulin. Blood testing, oral medications and injections become a way of life. Forever. I did know about Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, because some of my friends and family have it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry I was woefully uninformed about what people living with diabetes go though, especially those with T1D, to stay alive. I’ve learned some must check blood sugar multiple times a day, and calculate correct doses of insulin based on calorie and carbs immediately before eating. I didn’t know that. I am thankful I don’t have diabetes or have to do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have learned so much. More than 100 million Americans now live with diabetes, according to [**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/reports/reportcard.html). It’s good news that diabetes in adults has decreased, but sad and discouraging that it is on the rise for children. I can’t image how hard it must be for parents to manage this disease in young children. I’m blessed I don’t have to.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry parents have to teach their beautiful children with T1D to endure repeated needle pricks, to have no shame when it comes to testing blood sugar and to learn how to give themselves insulin shots before meals or snacks when in a restaurant, airplane, stadium or any public space. [**It is your right to manage your condition openly, anywhere, and in any place**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html). “People with diabetes have the right to participate fully in our society without sacrificing their medical safety or facing discrimination because of misunderstandings, fears, and stereotypes about diabetes,” according to the American Diabetes Association.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry that, before dashing an off-the-cuff opinion based on an emotional reaction on [**Let’s Eat South Florida**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/letseatsouthflorida/), I didn’t educate myself by visiting the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation at [**DiabetesResearch.org**](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__www.diabetesresearch.org_%26d%3DCwMFaQ%26c%3Dy2w-uYmhgFWijp_IQN0DhA%26r%3D8L2QR-YsbRfJPRpEthsVg_SZwcMRtUJg1T_XGDIFJIY%26m%3D92YS5pMszBmPh_bYKtAtTX5-ZrHyJaIeiOH1NhzS-Qs%26s%3D7ZdwHKg-L3i64-8rOdmZ5A_KTQVZhgmGYsxqjwAXyMg%26e%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdchristensen%40sunsentinel.com%7C6efb625dbaea41cdecd108d6ffe9a05f%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C636977776228408544&amp;sdata=KrKdiZVJiGmQogKPWCQ4v4RYzeijVzfATJBzWXrjVGQ%3D&amp;reserved=0), the American Association of Diabetes Educators at[ **Diabeteseducator.org**](http://diabeteseducator.org/), the Centers for Disease Control at [**CDC.gov/diabetes**](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/education.html), the American Diabetes Foundation at [**Diabetes.org**](http://www.diabetes.org/) or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at [**JDRF.org**](https://www.jdrf.org/). Many of these organizations kindly offered to assist and educate me, and I thank them for that. As a journalist, I understand I have a responsibility to the truth, and I take that extremely seriously. But I also have opinions and views as a human, separate from my job. My comments were made in that capacity, a Jane Q. Citizen. But, alas, where does being a journalist begin and end when it comes to these sorts of things? It was not my wish to reflect badly upon my newspaper, colleagues, family or friends. Or, to become an internet pinata. For the record, the Sun Sentinel did not order me to apologize or write this column, nor did it threaten my job.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry some people think those with diabetes should test and administer insulin in a public restroom. I did not suggest that, as many incorrectly attributed to me. I do understand that a filthy bathroom can be a dangerous place to self-dose. There was equal outrage about my suggestion of going to the car. [**People with diabetes say they have a right to shameless public displays of diabetes**](https://insulinnation.com/treatment/shameless-public-displays-of-diabetes/), according to an enlightening post on InsulinNation.com.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry my opinion helped [**perpetuate stigma and shame**](https://www.diabetesdaily.com/blog/2013/07/the-stigma-of-diabetes/), leading some, *especially*children, to hide their condition. I’ve learned this can develop into poor management because people wait to treat until they are in a private space. That’s dangerous and puts their health at serious risk. Many members of the diabetes community have educated me about the hell they go though to live. I thank them for sharing their gut-wrenching stories with me. I wish they didn’t have this sadistic disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry this disease could result in the loss of limbs, eyesight, causes diabetic heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, high blood pressure, nerve damage and other medical complications. How utterly awful that must be to lose a foot, leg, or your life, or have to endure regular, painful [**dialysis as kidneys begin to fail**](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/diabetes).  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry life-sustaining insulin can cost thousands of dollars a month. [**It’s wrong that companies are trying to make a profit off millions of humans who need his medication to live**](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-op-edit-drug-pricing-nat-scandal-20190319-story.html#nt=instory-link). “As many as one in every five Americans are trying to cope with Big Pharma’s morally indefensible pricing schemes by leaving prescriptions unfilled, skipping doses or splitting pills,” according to an editorial the Sun Sentinel recently published.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry people often fat- and food-shame those living with diabetes for what they eat and for ""not maintaining a healthy diet.” It’s nobody’s business what anyone eats or how diabetes is managed.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry low or high blood sugar can kill or cause a coma from insulin shock because medicine wasn’t dosed correctly or taken on time, or because of shame.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry some members of the diabetes community felt it was OK to bully, harass and threaten me, my family and friends on social media. I received death threats, was subjected to abusive language, and have been relentlessly trolled by hundreds of members of the diabetes community for days. That’s not OK. Emails and Facebook messages were sent to the Sun Sentinel demanding I be fired for my opinion (that’s my job). Some kind souls were ashamed of this behavior and warned me I wasn’t safe. I thank them for that. Others sent emails to help educate me. Thanks for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Others, not so much. “I saw your post about someone taking literally life saving insulin in a restaurant and that you thought it was “gross,” wrote Kristen Hohmann in an email. “I can only hope someone or everyone you love or you directly discover an entirely unprovoked genetic illness that destroys your ability to live life as a normal person and have to do something like that to stay alive. I hope you die in a fire you ignorant bitch.”  
&gt;  
&gt;More said they hoped I would die from a diabetic coma. Scads of others called me vile, unpublishable names on my personal [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217244351173136&amp;set=a.2749052177793&amp;type=3&amp;theater) and [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/doreenchristensen/?hl=en) accounts. No matter how offensive some thought my comments were, they had no right to threaten bodily harm. That’s not OK.  
&gt;  
&gt;I contacted administrators of Facebook diabetes groups and asked them to moderate member comments that advocated harassing me online. They assured me they would, and they have. I thank them for that, and trust the diabetes community will police itself and speak out against such dangerous mob mentality.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry some think my opinion was discrimination. It was not. I didn’t not violate anyone’s rights by having an *opinion*. I took no action. My speech and this column is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Those out there who disagree with me and others — who also happen to have diabetes — have the right to express their opinions. I celebrate and welcome that. My comments did not violate the Americans With Disability Act. I did not violate any law. There is no need to report me to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as some on Twitter advocated. If people with diabetes are truly discriminated against, they can call [**ADA legal advocates at 800-342-2383**](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/public-accommodations/fact-sheet-diabetes-public-gvrnprograms.html). Know your rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry I couldn’t make larger donations to the American Diabetes Foundation at [**Diabetes.org**](http://www.diabetes.org/) and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation at [**JDRF.org**](https://www.jdrf.org/) to repent for my insensitive comments. I dedicated my contributions to all those who have died from the disease. I know my money will help further diabetes education and research, but mostly, to one day find a cure.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m sorry diabetes sucks.

Overreacting or what?,"So I am 9 weeks pregnant and a couple of weeks ago I had my first appointment with a midwife at a new (to me) women’s clinic. It all went fine, I didn’t particularly enjoy or dislike her and I’m being referred to an MFM anyway. But I was reading my after-visit paper and under “problems addressed today” it had “type 2 diabetes with complications, no long term use of insulin specified.” 

I’m really upset about that, obviously type 1 and type 2 are very different and I don’t want that misinformation transferred to the MFM and to not receive proper treatment for my baby and I. I do plan on bringing this up to the midwife at my next appointment on the 10th, but I’m really upset because I do remember that I specified to her that I was diagnosed type 1 and it was still written as type 2.",diabetes_t1,1562375261,psy_chic333,9,2,True,2019-07-05
Cholesterol high ever since t1,"Hello everyone,

I'm a case of LADA - got late onset type 1 when I was 29, about two years ago.

Half a year ago my routine bloodwork came back with total cholesterol at 245 and LDL at 131 - whoa! Still at the same weight and pretty healthy overall. I cut out 99% of my dairy (I ate a lot of cheese) and 4 months later I reduced my cholesterol to 220 total (111 LDL). Now I'm in the process of reducing meat and doing more vegan meals.

Painful CGM,"A little background: I have been wearing the G5/6 for almost a year now and have always put it on my lower back slightly above my pants line. I've always had my gf or a friend put it in and have a only a few problems. Both of them are gone currently so I decided to try and put it in my stomach for one. 1 day out and it hurts quite a bit and is making me feel like I have cramps. 

I'm planning on taking it out and teaching a new friend how to put it in tomorrow but was curious if other people had this problem? I'm curious if it is a one time thing or if I'm just odd and can't have it in my stomach. 

I have pretty low fat percentages and have always had a problem with finding insulin and CGM sites.  The only other time I have gotten any shots or anything like it in my stomach was when I was first diagnosed and my pediatrician gave me a shot but that was far too high (ribs almost) and gave me a small scar.

Medtronic 670g Guardian Sensors are driving me mad.,"I am a type one for about 28 years and use the Medtronic 670g system including the sensors.  It works really well for me and generally I'm very happy with it.  However...

It's very hot in my part of the world right now and I work an active job.  Without fail, my sensor will come loose and partially dislodge from my skin during the workday. 

I feel like I've tried everything. I prep the surface with isopropyl alcohol and let it dry before inserting.  I've used skin tac and IV prep around the site (not where the sensor inserts due to worries about harming the sensor.) I've used tape, tegaderm, and fixic patches over the top.  I've inserted in arms, abdomen, and even legs. 

I don't have anyone around who can help me insert it and due to flexibility concerns, my available areas are slightly limited.  And this problem doesn't occur when I'm relaxing at home or even at work when it's cold outside.  Only sweat+movement set it loose. 

Please, any tips/tricks/magic voodoo you know of that will keep my sensor in place? I've replaced 3 sensors in the last week and I am at the end of my rope here!",diabetes_t1,1562237078,Brand-Spanking-New,10,9,True,2019-07-04

*rant* shitty roller coaster night,"I'm gonna start by saying that I'm typically in control, cbg wise (3 day average is 119, 7 day 153, 30 day 165) and my hb1ac is at 6.2 three months ago. Nowadays I usually take a unit or two higher because life is hard and sometimes ice cream and chocolates can save it. Anywaaays back to the rant..


Tonight I had the worst dinner of my life. I ordered my favorite dish (first time at this place) after bolusing approriately. They gave me the shittiest cut of meat to the point that I was not able to finish my rice. I then ordered takoyaki to balance out my carbs and then took a walk to lessen the stress and stabilize my sugar. I arrive home feeling normal, do my usual shit only to feel shaky after an hour or so - I checked then saw that I was at 68.


But hey, thats nice, I can eat a round two dinner now, can't I? Great. So I proceed to inject a few units to prepare myself for a bowl of cereal which I normally eat for breakfast. I'm low so I took 2/3 of what I usually take - should be about right since I plan on staying in bed right?? Riiight??? Of course not..


Fast forward to two hours after, a little past 1 in the morning I start feeling uneasy again. Damn, I just ate bruh, I can't be low again??? So I checked. Guess what. It's @#$(/! 68 again! So I hesitantly get up and find something sweet. I ended up eating a bunch of chocolates and crackers just to stop the shaking.


Aaaaaaand now its around 4 am, I'm probably high on sugar, tired as fuck, and really really pissed off at how everything spiralled downwards and how I'm bound to have this shitty experience again someday. Probably soon. I dunno.


Bottomline js that I'm scared, really. What if I just slept right after I ate my cereals and did not feel my low? Would I still be able to wake up tomorrow? Or what if I just shook it off and didnt bother checking? This is the fourth time I checked today anyways.. sooo tired of pricking myself again and again and again..


*Ends rant. I hope you guys are having a better time!

Help looking for new doctor,"I moved to the Denver, CO area a little over a year ago and am wanting to find a good doctor that is knowledgeable about CGMs and pumps. I have been a type 1 diabetic for over 18 years with about 15 years on a pump so I'm comfortable with it overall, but of course I have plenty of problems and still need a doctor to help figure out what's best for me (and get me prescriptions). My last A1C was 6.7 so not great but nothing I'm overly concerned about. I prefer to have a general care doctor who can help with everything (I'm healthy otherwise) but specializes in diabetes. Maybe that's expecting to much but I've had success with that previously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a doctor shortly after I moved here who I had found using my insurance's ""find a network doctor"" site then reading reviews online about the ones that came up and a lot of people mentioned him being good with diabetics. I really liked him and may still go back, but he was more familiar with type 2 and anything dealing with looking into new pumps/CGMs he said he simply referred you to other sources so I'd like to look into other options. I got the Medtronic 670G about 2 years ago and used the CGM and auto mode with it for a little less then a year but stopped due to it being too expensive. I really liked it the majority of the time so would like to continuously look at getting back on it in or an alternative (like Dexcom). To do that I think I'd be better off finding a doctor who is more up to date on new technology now so they can start getting to know me and making good recommendations.

T1D post surgery management,"So bit of a long story, I’m 16 diagnosed almost 2 years ago been on a t slim x2 with Dexcom g5 for almost a year. After a long bout of various heath issues that emerged soon after diagnosis I decided to have a rathkes cleft cyst drained. A RCC is a cyst on the pituitary gland which is a gland generally considered part of the brain that sits right below it. The cyst was worse than the thought and drained/partially removed during surgery. Essentially it’s brain surgery through the nose. I had the surgery June 10th and it’s now July 1st. My blood sugar has been very hard to control since surgery but the last several days have been extremely difficult. Yesterday I was over 200 for over 12 hours. Today I only had carbs once in the morning, I spiked to almost 400 and it took 6 hours and 29 units of extra bolus (normally that would take about 7 for me) to come back down. I didn’t eat any carbs for dinner but bolused 5 units anyways and my bg is already over 200 and climbing. Yesterday I used a 150% temp rate all day and today 175% but it didn’t appear to help. Before surgery my bg was extremely well controlled (7.2 a1c but last several weeks were particularly perfect), and initially after surgery was difficult but the last 3ish days have been hell. Yesterday urine strips showed large amount of glucose but no ketones and today’s showed no glucose or ketones but I’m worried as the strips expire and these are like a year and a half old. I’ve also tried changing my site with no success and there’s no reason for anything to be wrong with my insulin. Has anyone had experience with erratic blood sugar after surgery? Also has anyone had urine strips be incorrect as I don’t have a blood ketone meter? I don’t know if I should go to the hospital.

College and Type One- has anyone dormed alone?,"Hi there. Im going to be entering college in the fall and am working on the dorm/roommate part. Ive discussed with my mom, and I think I may try to dorm alone in a single. Part of me still feels like maybe its not the best choice, since I feel like i may be missing out on the “college experience” of a roommate. However, Ive been diagnosed for over 7 years now, and have an a1c in the 6 range, and will be getting the dexcom soon as well. 

My current reasoning for dorming alone are
- noise from dex might annoy roommate
- more privacy diabetes wise/regularly
- might allow more freedom when it comes to changing sites, or even non type one wise like studying

My cons are
- missing the “”experience””
- in case of an emergency i wouldnt have a roommate so Id need to go to others in my floor/an RA, although hopefully I wouldnt need to
- harder to make friends?

Did you have a healthy pregnancy despite your diabetes?,"I (30/F) am 10w2d pregnant. This is my second pregnancy. First ended in miscarriage at 8 weeks. There was no obvious issue - baby had a heartbeat at one ultra sound and then didn’t the next. It’s assumed there was a chromosomal issue and it wasn’t related to my diabetes. My a1c at that time was 6.0%. That was in March. My last a1c just a few weeks ago was 5.8%. I’ve been working closely with my endocrinologist to adjust my basal and bolus rates (contact at least weekly to review numbers). I have a Dexcom CGM and Omnipod. My goals are to be around 95 fasting and 120 two hours after meals. For the most part I am doing pretty well but diabetes is unpredictable.

I’ve have a few occasions like this - pump site failure, carb miscalculation, whatever the case may be.. it has happened. I correct and bring it back down as quickly as possible but I’m basically terrified that these moments can cause the baby’s heart to stop beating again. 

My question for other women who have had babies while having T1D (or their partners) is did you have moments of extreme highs in this range? If so, did your pregnancy go on successfully? Were you able to carry to term and deliver on your own? Or did you have to have a c-section early?

"Recently started on Tresiba, not sure how it works ?","Hey,

Context: I'm a 23 y.o. T1D since 1998 (age 2), on Freestyle Libre CGM, injecting Fiasp at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and now since saturday Tresiba (new long-acting insuline, ""degludec"") around 10pm. Before that, I've used most of my life glargine long-acting insuline (Lantus), but had issues with it not lasting the promised 24 hours and thus having spikes at the end of the afternoon / before dinner so my endo recommended Tresiba, which is supposed to last around 40 hours while still taken daily (don't really know how they made it so the doses don't stack up, but that's irrelevant I guess).

Doubt that's relevant, but I'm also currently taking 150-200mg a day of Alprazolam and Venlafaxine once a day, and had been before the switch to Tresiba with no change in my BS (except less ""stress spikes"").

Other tidbit is that I'm living in France and this recent switch to Tresiba unfortunately coincides with the super heat wave we're having right now, so maybe that's related.

My problem is that I basically don't get how this new insulin works *at all*. My endo said the conversion Lantus to Tresiba should be roughly 1:1, but to err on the safe side at first.

I have the 200u/ml pen version; since that was not super clear and neither my endo nor my pharmacist acknowledged that there exists 2 versions (100u/ml pens, like with Lantus, and this 200u/ml), when I first tested it on saturday I injected around half my usual Lantus dose (18), so 10 of Tresiba, just to be safe. It was a disaster and I massively spiked at the end of the night and had to correct in the morning. No other spikes during the day. So the next night, I tried with 14u, and had exactly the same results. Next night, tried 18u, and still, massive spike in the morning. Now I've read that dose adjustments with Tresiba may take up to 3 days to be fully effective, but I've already injected 18u for the last three days, and there's still absolutely no difference compared to the first day when I tried 10. My BS is relatively stable (around 120-150) before bed and till 4am, then spikes super quickly and I wake around 8 or 9am at 300-400! With Lantus, it was the opposite, as my BS used to go down a bit (~70-80) around 6-7am before dawn effect took over.

It feels like there's somewhat a long-acting insulin in effect during the day because other than correcting for the morning spike, I've had no need to adjust any other Fiasp dose during the day. Except I still have the same spikes at the end of the afternoon that I had with Lantus.

Basically I'm completely lost. I have no idea why I spike like that during the night with this Tresiba, and going from 10u to 18u seemed to have no effect at all, neither with the morning spikes nor with the rest of the day. What's happening? Could the heat affect the insulin in the pen? (I keep my pens in my room once opened and not in the fridge, but never had any heat-related issue with any kind of insulin before. Is Tresiba more sensitive to heat?)

by my a1c i seem to be in control (weird rant i don’t rly know where this is going),"but it’s difficult. i’ve been told i’ve had a really good a1c for my age (16) and how long i’ve been diagnosed (almost 4 years). ever since about a year in i’ve had an a1c of &lt;7.0 and my endo + aunt (who has a diabetic kid my age, but diagnosed longer) always compliment me on my control. really, i think it’s because i just had a habit of eating low carb my whole life. my current diet i think would be considered moderately low carb. usually i eat 100-150g a day but sometimes i spike for no good reason and it’s tiring. i think having a decent range most of the time makes the highs feel much worse. at times i have highs for hours on end and it makes me want to die. i don’t know where i’m going with this lmao. 
what i’m trying to say is it seems like i’m in control, but it’s still immensely tiring and difficult to live with this. i’m glad that i was immediately independent with injections and cgm/pump site infusions ever since diagnosis. i don’t have a problem with having blood drawn for lab work, and automode on the 670G actually works for me. i seem like the dream diabetic sometimes and i’m thankful for those factors because they really do make it easier, but damn it’s difficult. but hey, i’m still here.

Choosing a CGM and New Insulin Pump,"I am currently a Omnipod user but the pods are becoming too expensive for me \[in my mind\] and it's not really helping me hit the targets I would like to accomplish with my BG readings and A1C reports. I am currently looking into purchasing a CGM and possibly looking into switching to the T-Slim x2 \[I think that's the correct name\]. 

The two CGMs I am choosing between are (1) Dexcom G6 and (2) Medtronics Guardian. The T-Slim rep I spoke to said he's using the TSLim with the Dexcom G6 and it's TREMENDOUS!! He honestly has my hopes up in addition to not having to check my sugar at all with the G6. The Medtronic Guardian has to be calaborated once every 12 hours to ensure the readings are accurate. 

Looking at the cost, keeping the Omnipod and purchasing the Dexcom G6 would cost me $600 for 1 month of pods and 6 months of Dexcom sensors. If I go with the TSlim, they have an upgrade program allowing me to pay $1,000 for the insulin pump and 3 years of warranty \[while I'm still in warranty with Omnipod\]. The supplies will be my responsibilty though \[$150 for a month of infusion sets and $100 for a month of cartridges\]. All in all, approx. $1,550 for the TSlim + Dexcom or $1,500 for the Dexcom and a box of Omnipod pods (since I'm already using their system). 

Medtronic can get me the Guardian CGM for a little less than $1,100 with 6 months of sensors. However, I'm not liking the calibration thing because if there is a discrepancy, then it will call for more finger sticking. 

  


Any thoughts on the T-Slim, the CGM sensors, or my choice in general? Really any input will help. I'm just trying to be reasonable and cost-concious.",diabetes_t1,1561660652,LonelyNLove,6,1,True,2019-06-27

I knew my health wasn’t great but to be diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic was something else. I’ve had several mental breakdowns since then. My last breakdown was yesterday after reading into some articles that talk about healthcare and insurances covering prescriptions. I’ve been lucky enough to have insurance through my job and with the copays, it makes life a lot easier. One time the insurance was cut for whatever reason and I was told at the pharmacy that it would be $300 for two Humalog insulin pens. Luckily the issue with my insurance was fixed the next day and I payed a significantly smaller fraction for it. 

This subreddit has been my support system over the last couple of months. I have been very quiet here but I do enjoy reading the posts and conversations.

Involuntary Insulin Switch,"I feel like I ask a lot of questions here, but there is so much I'm learning on this sub after 17 years of being T1.

So I have UHC and have been on Novolog (either through a pump or pens) for the past 15 years or so. Last year (?) UHC tried to get me to switch to Humalog because it's cheaper, and my doc and I decided that Novolog works so why change it. He's been helpful sending PAs every 6 months. Well now UHC has ""excluded"" Novolog and denied our first appeal, so my doctor approved/prescribed Humalog without further discussing it with me. 

I'm super confused because I haven't seen him since March, and UHC told me last week there was a secondary appeal process, then I could personally appeal the decision. My doctor is not an endocrinologist, and I haven't seen one since I left TX Childrens at age 20 (about 4 years ago).

Sudden Insulin Sensitivity,"So I have been type 1 for almost 3 years now. I am usually pretty sensitive to insulin normally - I train 6 days a week in the gym, so 1 unit of Novorapid will usually cover 30g of carbs.

Since Saturday, I am having some strange issues with blood sugar control, mainly I have become even more insulin sensitive.

The only way I can stop having hypos is to take it every other meal (I have to eat every few hours to get enough calories due to weightlifting). I do not like doing this though as sometimes my blood sugar will rise to 10-12mmol after the first meal and will stay there until I take some insulin and eat again. 
I have also noticed that in the evening, even after not having taken insulin for 4+ hours beforehand, my blood sugar didn't really rise very much when I had about 70g carbs for dinner.

I have spoken to my specialist about this, but she has not been very helpful and just suggested to stop taking my bolus insulin and let her know in a week.

Diagnosing weird behavior from insulin,"My son's blood sugars have been relatively hard to control lately -- I suspect the last refill of insulin from the pharmacy may be spoiled, however I'm trying to figure out what else could be the issue.

He uses an omnipod with humalog.

The insulin seems to be just not working very well.

His blood sugars at night have been reasonably stable, but high, and no amount of correction has seemed to work. Even trying to give corrections via syringe hasn't made a dent.

This morning I doubled his basal rate, and doubled the correction at around 8am, which brought him from 190 to around 170 over the next two hours, and eventually down to around 140.

I prebolused him double for a late breakfast of an omelette and milk, and doubled the extended protein bolus. After half an hour, he was down around 130, and I made his breakfast.

We'll see how well this works... I'm guessing he's going to spike up to 250 or so and stay there the rest of the day :/

So, if bad insulin is the same as good insulin, only not as effective, for example 50% effective, I'd expect doubling the insulin doses to work. But I haven't seen the same rate of change in blood sugars as I would expect from effective insulin - it's like it's happening verrrry slowly, slowly enough that the insulin is breaking down before being fully absorbed, thus skewing the doses.

Could this be an absorption problem? We've been through three different pod sites and the behavior is the same everywhere. I'd expect with large doses that I'd see a dramatic drop in sugars, but I haven't been able to get there.

So, how DOES a spoiled insulin behave? How do absorption problems manifest themselves?
Could it be dehydration? Sickness? Hormones (he's going through puberty)? I'm at wits end trying to get his sugars under control,

My endo is going to get me another refill so I can try a different batch of insulin this evening, but I'm looking for any other info that can be useful in trying to puzzle this out.

[Note - he's been T1 for 3 years, on a pump for almost 2 years, and this behavior is out of the ordinary]

Dexcom rant,"I just really need to rant to a community that understands this stress.

I’ve had the g6 for 3 months. When I needed to do my first reorder of sensors they were on backorder and dexcom could not put in the request because they needed to do a pre-authorization. After only a month! They so graciously overnighted them once the authorization came in so I didn’t run out and I thought wow they’re great.

My second month of reordering came around and I wanted to call way ahead of time to make sure I would get them even with a backorder and the time it takes to ship (5-7 business days). They said they couldn’t put the order in yet so it would take another week. This would put me on my third sensor. As we all know sensors last 10 days. So by the time I can order I SHOULD get my sensors but there was a 10 day backorder... convenient. Again they so graciously decided to overnight me 1 free sensor and my month supply once the backorder was fixed.

My third month of reordering. I cannot get ahold of my representative. I called everyday for 5 days so I decided to call customer support. They tell me they’ve taken note of all of my calls (cool but they don’t call me back?) and then tell me they can’t reorder more sensors until my signed prescription is sent back to them form my doctor. I’m confused and frustrated because I had just given them a prescription 3 months ago. They don’t have that one on file... they have the prescription for the g5 (which I never bought because I couldn’t afford it) that was sent to them a year ago! Still confused I ask how they’ve been sending me supplies for a g6 when that prescription is for a g5 and they try to tell me it was written for both. 

Well I again ask for an overnight as soon as they get the prescription back. I called them and my doctors for 3 days before they receive it and to my surprise they’re on backorder. However, after they receive the prescription they tell me I still have one order left on my old prescription that they will send immediately (couldn’t have told me the first time?). I tell them along with this purchase I need a new transmitter. I notice in the invoice they didn’t put the transmitter in the order so I call my representative and again no answer so I call customer support. They tell me they need chartwork from my doctor of my blood sugars last month. I tell them I don’t have documentation of my blood sugar because I’ve been on the g6. They tell me no problem just have the dr notate that and it should be fine. So I’ve called the dr office everyday and they keep telling me they haven’t received it. 

I resort back to dexcom TODAY and they say they’ve sent the request on the 21st, 24th, and today. They also failed to mention but brought it up today that I need to have bloodwork done too in order to allow them to submit and order. Blood work of what?? I just had it done 3 months ago!

So I’m furious. I needed to change my sensor yesterday, so I do. I go to put in the sensor code and then it asked for my new transmitter code. Confused, I put in the same code of my old transmitter hoping it’ll work until I get the new one. Nope not the case. So now I have wasted $60 on a sensor, and who knows when I’ll get this transmitter. 

I finally contacted Costco and will be paying full price for a transmitter because dexcom fucking sucks. Luckily they have a rebate at the moment and the transmitter is almost have it’s normal price.

Aging off my parents' insurance + self-employed,"Hi everyone,

In a year I'll turn 26 and lose my coverage through my parents' health insurance. I live in New York City and am self-employed as a tutor, so I won't have an employee plan I can join.

My diabetes profile runs thus: I use a Tandem T-Slim X2 insulin pump, Humalog, Dexcom G6 sensors that pair with the pump. I've been diabetic since age 3 and my control is really good, so I rarely ever need to see a doctor about anything diabetes-related.

I'm wondering if anyone on here has been in a similar position and can offer any advice. I'm at the beginning of this process and it's daunting!

"Pitting edema, recently diagnosed.","How goes it everyone, 

25 y/o previously healthy male, active, still relatively healthy and active, but diagnosed 5 days ago with T1D. 

As well as starting Levemir(12 units qday) and Humalog (7 units with meals TID (was 5, but increased due to being severely uncontrolled)

My A1c &lt;14%, probably to be expected as since I returned from working on a commercial fishing boat for 3 months 1 month ago I had progressively worsening symptoms (thirst, urination 15-20 times a day, fatigue, leg cramps, etc). The symptoms I had stubbornly denied to think was anything other than being exhausted from working a lot. 

Anyways, I flew from Florida to Washington state yesterday returning to my residence from my home state, and am now stuck with bilateral lower extremity swelling. It started on the plane, however going on 12+ hours since I've stepped foot off the plane it remains. 

It doesn't bother me too much, and I'm confident it is nothing serious being that I have no calf pain/tenderness, shortness of breath, or chest pain... it's just annoying and I've never had this happen before. My diet (changing since discovering the diagnosis) has been low carb, high protein, moderate sodium.

So the question I suppose is; has anyone had this sort of swelling when they first started taking insulin? If so, were there any complications or did it go away on its own? 
last question.. should I expect this to happen each time I travel?

A message to T1s/parents of T1s who take stimulants,"When I was 4, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and when i was about 10 or 11, I was diagnosed with executive function challenges, which meant that I started taking stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse, Focalin, Dexedrine, etc) once I started 7th grade. What nobody ever told me about the combination of the two conditions is that stimulants will actually raise your blood sugar.

Amphetamine stimulants used to treat conditions like mine activate the [Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAAR1), which causes your liver to emit more glucose, raising your blood sugar. In people who take stimulants with functioning pancreases, this is not an issue. However, when I was younger, my parents could not figure out why my blood sugar would skyrocket every morning I had school. The reason for this spike was twofold, one, I ate cereal every morning, which has a high glycemic index; and two, I would take Focalin or Vyvanse every morning. My problem was that nobody, neither my psychiatrist nor my endocrinologist, told me that my stimulants would raise my blood sugar.

So, for those of you who take stimulants or raise children who take stimulants, you should figure out a temp basal or extra bolus or something to treat the high blood sugar caused by stimulants. My A1cs when I was younger were always higher than they should have been, and I can't help but feel a little frustrated that neither my psychiatrist nor my endocrinologist understood the very simple thing I just explained.",diabetes_t1,1561318984,Commander_Zircon,6,17,True,2019-06-23

"[vent] Argh, unexplained high","So, my 12yo son worked his butt off last week volunteering at a day camp, and his numbers were great. Then yesterday his sugars were maybe a bit higher than usual, things not working very well at all; I suspected his pump site had started failing so I replaced the pump.

This morning things were looking better, but then afternoon, his sugars were again creeping high, and he spent most of the day over 230; tried injection instead of pump, and still didn't seem to help much. Had his temporary basal set to +95% for a large part of the day too.

So now he's over 400, his CGM stopped giving readings a couple of hours ago, trying to get him to bed.

One thought is that he could be sick. but no fever, he's not feeling any symptoms.

Ketone meter says 0.1

My only other straw here is that the insulin could be bad. We brought the insulin to the day camp, but it was kept in an air conditioned building, inside a Frio pouch....but it's my only other suspect, having tried everything else.

Just popped a new bottle of insulin and gave a correction by syringe.

T1 here. I had a *20* blood sugar reading last week.,"31 year old guy here. I've been t1 for 26 years. 6.3 a1c, generally well controlled. I was on a solo trip to Michigan last week, staying at an old hotel in the middle of nowhere in the upper peninsula. Long story short, I woke up at 7 AM on my first morning there, instantly knew I was very low, tested and saw a 20 on the meter. It's the 2nd lowest reading of my life (I had an 18 when I was a teenager, passed out in my kitchen and was resuscitated by my local fire department) - when that number popped up I knew I had about 20 seconds to respond or there was a good chance I was going to die in that room. I instantly chugged a 12 oz grape juice bottle as I barreled downstairs to my car to get more juice ( i had purchased some the previous night but forgot to take it into the room, almost cost me my life). I partially blacked out but I remember barreling through the lobby breakfast area and everything began violently spinning. I burst through the front door and started to lose my vision and balance. I saw white flashes of light and could no longer feel my feet touching the ground. It was about 20 yards from the front door to my car, I still don't know how I made it without collapsing. One distinct memory as I lurched towards the car was mashing the key fob to unlock the door with as much intensity as I've ever put forth in my life. I got the door open and collapsed into the front seat.

Recently diagnosed T1. Living in a 3rd world country with limited options. Advice regarding medical apparatus needed.,"Hi reddit,  


I was diagnosed with t1 about 2 months ago. Been treating it with the help of a doctor and insulin with decent results (blood sugars down from 350+ during diagnosis around 70-120, working slowly towards the sweet spot of 83). Had some unpleasant lows on the way but hey its a learning process right.   


My situation shortly: The 3rd world country where I live in has only one company for medical apparatus related  to diabetes, MedTronic. I am trialing their insulin pump 630G for about a week now and the thing is amazing. Every time I get to sit down for a meal and have to push a few buttons instead of injecting insulin manually I feel very happy. Nothing bad to say about the pump. However the constant blood glucose monitor from MedTronic (believe its called Guardian Connect? the one that works with the 630G anyway..) is a little bit less impressive. I like the ""suspend on low""-feature a lot, just wish the monitor was a bit more accurate.   


MedTronic rep suggested I look into getting the newer 670G from my home country (about 10 hours flight away, I visit once or twice annually) as its a newer model and might be cheaper there - the country where I live in taxes diabetes apparatus highly. From what I understood there is also a better CGM from MedTronic out there using a newer sensor (Guardian 3, the one Im using with the 630G is the older model from I understood)? Wouldnt mind making the switch to that, if its better than the Guardian Connect/630G combo.

ANYWAYS! A few things I was hoping I could get answers to...  


1) Is it convenient to buy the newer version of the pump (670G) from my home country and use it where I live about 10 000 kms away? How often are you guys needing replacements for the pump, how often do they break down, etc? I do have support from MedTronic in the country where I live in now, as in spare parts etc, but if I needed a new pump in case the old 670G breaks down that would take time, I assume 2 weeks or so. MedTronic said they can give me a replacement pump if that happens (would be a 630G I assume), and that they can find a way to send the general spare parts needed for the pump and monitor (sensors, etc) to the country where I live in so that shouldnt be an issue.  


2) How much of an improvement is the Guardian 3-sensor from the CGM sensor that works together with the 630G? How much of an improvement is the 670G from the 630G? I read that 670G should be more automated and can increase basal if sugars look high which I like. Ive read some mixed reviews on reddit about the 670G though.  


3) Is it silly to buy a pump that has no support in the country I live in? For example my home country has Omnipod for sale but the country where I live in has 0 support for it, so Id have to fly 10 000 kilometres every time I want a new pump or more spare parts. Guess that doesnt work out? I wouldnt want to fly the distance more often than once every 6 months.  


4) How about using the 630G (or 670G) for pump but another CGM such as DexCom G6? How much am I missing out by not having the pump and the CGM work together, as in how much am I missing out by not having the system adjust basal automatically?   


Im not entirely sure if I can even buy a DexCom since in my home country (Finland) Omnipod and DexCom dont sell products to private patients directly and Im not entitled to healthcare in Finland anymor since Im not a resident. So Im not sure if a doctor would even treat me/assign the CGM for me even if I pay for it fully. But I could look into it. DexCom has no operations or support in the country I live in fwiw.   


Insurance is not a consideration, it will not pay anything for me in neither country. So I will pay for all costs for pump and CGM and spare parts.  Money is not an issue. I just want the best machines/the best combination of a pump+CGM I can get that is convenient for me. Ive been talking with the MedTronic reps about the logistics of pulling this thing off but I dont expect to get non-biased opinions from them-would be good to hear what reddit thinks. I think Im getting the hang of this diabetes thing pretty well, just a few things I could use help with.

Infusion set 640g doesn't work :/,"Hi to all of you, my sweet friends :)

Emotional toll,"Hey everyone. I need some advice. It sounds dramatic and ridiculous but I often feel like a failure when my blood sugar is high. I only think that I deserve to feel good about myself when my numbers are in range. The Dexcom sometimes makes it worse; I spend so much time staring at that screen and beating myself up when it doesn’t say what I want it to say. 

I have tried to get my A1C below 7 for years. My most recent result was 7.6. My doctor recently prescribed Victoza in the hopes of getting my average down, and he’s very encouraging and complimentary. If he isn’t disappointed in me, why can’t I stop telling myself that I’m failing? I know logically that taking medication is nothing to be ashamed of, but I feel like a mess when I compare myself to the type 1 diabetics who manage this so well without the OmniPod, Dexcom, or Victoza that I now use. I remind myself that “comparison is the thief of joy,” and yet I succumb to it anyway. I’ve been crying a lot and subsequently feel guilty for acting so self-absorbed. If I only devoted all the time that I spend obsessing about my blood sugar to helping others...

I want to boost my insulin sensitivity and get the A1C down, of course, but I’m also getting more and more worried about how anxious and sad I’ve been feeling. I take an anti-anxiety medication already but lately I find myself lying awake and imagining a scary future with all kinds of diabetes complications, like losing feeling in my feet or blindness or never being able to carry children, even though I know that nobody can predict the future and dwelling on all of the possibilities doesn’t help. Stress raises blood sugar, too, and maybe if I could just calm down somehow, I could kill two birds with one stone by improving my A1C *and* my emotions.

Has anyone else felt like this? Thanks if you took the time to read all of that.",diabetes_t1,1561089669,bfc9cz,7,18,True,2019-06-21

IAmA T1D Who lost one too many CGM sensors and am giving out FREE SAMPLES of my solution to the problem: Patchabetes,"I was diagnosed with T1D in 2008, and spent the next 10 years pricking my fingers all day, everyday. A little over a year ago, I switched to the Freestyle Libre and it instantly changed my life for the better. I like to compare it to the difference between looking at pictures and watching a video. 

The one thing I didn't like about the Libre was how often I seemed to have the sensor knocked off my arm in the most innocuous of ways. Taking off my shirt, rolling over in bed, knocking it against a doorframe... The list goes on. I was tired of spending more money out of pocket replacing the sensor whenever this happened, so I went to the drawing board to create a solution.

After doing some research, I quickly noticed that most people had DIY'd themselves some sort of tape based barrier, almost never with tools that were specifically designed to help solve this problem. I decided to do the work myself to design the best possible tape for this particular purpose of securing a CGM to your body and get the full two weeks of use out of it every time. 

About 8 months ago, after testing different tapes and designs until it worked to perfection, Patchabetes was born. I haven't lost a sensor since. 

With my partner, we created a website ([www.mypatchabetes.com](https://www.mypatchabetes.com)) and have just launched on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Adhesive-Patches-Count-Waterproof-Mixed/dp/B07RJZDG4Q/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=patchabetes&amp;qid=1560957717&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Adhesive-Patches-Count-Waterproof-Mixed/dp/B07RJZDG4Q/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=patchabetes&amp;qid=1560957717&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1)) We currently offer a patch that fits over the Freestyle Libre (will fit over the Miao Miao as well), Guardian 3 and Enlite sensors. We hope to expand our line of patches to fit over all kinds of sensors in the near future!

Since we are still new, and I created Patchabetes to help fellow T1Ds with a CGM who are experiencing the same issues I was, I want to give out sample patches to any of you that are interested in them. I am based in Canada, but will do my best to accommodate shipping to whomever is interested in trying one out. If you want to test out Patchabetes for free, send me a DM with your address and the colour patch you would like!

I could have lost my life tonight,So back story. My sigars have been up and down for a while now (few months) been fighting to get a cgm after my last unexpected no symptom low had me pass out outside unconcious at my job for over 2 hours then waking up in ambulance. I figured if it happened again the cgm would prevent it or at least help. So went to my dr about not an endo but hes been managing my diabetes for 10+ yrs cause we have no endos close that take my insurance. He said no he wont do it wants me to see an endo thats 3 hrs away okay fine. Waited 3 wks they finally call wth an appt their only opening is 6 months out Dec 17th. Wtf ok fine time to research other endos. Anyways so thats my back story. Well tonight it happened again another no symptom no sign nothing to indicate I was low until it was too late. This time I was behind the wheel when it happened. I crashed my car. My airbags deployed  my car that i just got 3 days ago is wrecked (its a used car bought second hand so no warranty yay -.-). I woke up in the hospital no recalling anything. Got told bits and pieces of what happened. Basically i hit a fire hydrant after crossing across the lanes onto the opposite side of the road. And when i say hit it i mean full force 30mph smashed into it. Somehow I Miraculously came out with just a small abrasion to my neck from the seatbelt. What scared me more was te 14yr old girl who is like my lil sister was in the car when i started to act funny and drive crazy. Somehow in my fucked up state of mind i rememebered to drop her off (thank god!!) so she wasnt in the car when I crashed. But my god i could have killed her i feel so guilty and embarrassed. I know it easnt my fault not like i knew it was low and then drove. As it said it came on suddenly out of no where without a single warning... but still. So yeha like i said by some miracle i managed to 1. Not kill anyone 2. Not hit anyone or any other cars and 3. Live through it. I came out with just that small abrasion on my neck nothing else no smashed up face no broken bones. Im still in shock and slightly traumitized even though i dont recall it.

You should know that everyone with T1D is able to get the Access Pass for the National Parks.,"The USGS has free lifetime passes to the US forest service, national park service, fish and wildlife service, bureau of land management, USACE, and bureau of reclamation areas for those with a permanent disability (including T1 diabetes). All you need is a letter from your HCP that says you have T1 diabetes, it is permanent and is classified as a disability, and is under their care. A valid ID (drivers license, passport, etc.) and to fill out the application (super short and easy). Applying through the mail is $10 and doing it in person is free (also in person you don’t need the application). You also can get discounts on other things the parks offer like camp grounds.
While the pass is great because it’s free access there are a couple more reasons to get it besides it being free.
The pass also allows Rangers and other LEO to know if there is someone in the park that may need additional assistance incase something were to happen. Even if you don’t feel disabled, as I’m sure a fair amount of us don’t, if you feel guilty because your getting a free pass there’s nothing stopping you from donating to the parks.",diabetes_t1,1560879361,007_jbnd5,59,158,True,2019-06-18

Killing a pod,"My son was curious what would happen if we subjected his Omnipod to strong magnetic fields.

So tonight when we changed his pod, we prevented the PDM from seeing the old pod when we deactivated it, to keep it going (after removing it).

He had dismantled a hard drive and harvested the super strong magnets from the head servos. The magnet sticks quite well on the battery side of the pod, but causes no noticable effects. We then placed the battery over the circuit board, right over the pump mechanism. Again, nothing.

Then we tried twisting the magnet over the pump mechanism. AH, now we were rewarded with the annoying high pitched whine of pod failure!

LYING ABOUT BEING T1,"Hello everyone,

I would like to first thank anybody who takes the time to read this and potentially help us out in this very odd situation.

First I would like to state that I don’t have T1, tho I grew up with a father who was diagnosed with T1 at the age of 15.

Tho this is where the story takes a left turn! I am very close with my wife’s family, her siblings and I are very great friends, we all have great meaningful relationships with each other. Tho now there is a new addition to the group, my brother-in-law’s fiancé.

She entered our life’s 3 years ago, as they were just dating at the time, and she starting showing signs of lying... A LOT!

Then one night while we were hanging out, she pulled out a glucose meter, and started talking about how she’s diabetic. I was immediately turned off, and was asking follow up questions. Something smelt fishy. 

The more we hung out and saw her (over the next year), she would show no signs of dealing with T1.

I told my brother-in-law, and that went interesting. He didn’t want to hear it, made excuses for her, and kept telling me she was in-fact a Diabetic. He’s got a severe needle phobia, so he’s never seen her inject herself (how convenient). His last statement after I laid out all the evidence, and after he fought me on it was “well if she doesn’t diabetes then she thinks she does” WTAF?!? 

Now in present day, they are now engaged and planned to get married. There is a lot of push back from a family members due to her being a pathological liar, and a parasite (literally). 

She is in fact not T1 Diabetic, she had purchased a OTC Novalin N bottle of insulin a year and a half ago, never used, she has no needles, and a new box of unused lancets and a Glucose Meter. 

She has stopped talking about being a diabetic, which she loved doing in the beginning of their relationship, tho it’s all crickets now. 

And to make things worse she has been living with his parents for a couple years now, and has completely made them believe she’s diabetic.

So here is where I ask! 

What would you do?

We are about to move forward this week about bringing this to light, so I would love to hear other voices. How would you get her to finally say that she “isn’t” T1?

Thanks again, and my apologies if this was taboo to bring up in this group.",diabetes_t1,1560755287,icamp4free,23,15,True,2019-06-17

Tonight could have ended my life,So back story. My sigars have been up and down for a while now (few months) been fighting to get a cgm after my last unexpected no symptom low had me pass out outside unconcious at my job for over 2 hours then waking up in ambulance. I figured if it happened again the cgm would prevent it or at least help. So went to my dr about not an endo but hes been managing my diabetes for 10+ yrs cause we have no endos close that take my insurance. He said no he wont do it wants me to see an endo thats 3 hrs away okay fine. Waited 3 wks they finally call wth an appt their only opening is 6 months out Dec 17th. Wtf ok fine time to research other endos. Anyways so thats my back story. Well tonight it happened again another no symptom no sign nothing to indicate I was low until it was too late. This time I was behind the wheel when it happened. I crashed my car. My airbags deployed  my car that i just got 3 days ago is wrecked (its a used car bought second hand so no warranty yay -.-). I woke up in the hospital no recalling anything. Got told bits and pieces of what happened. Basically i hit a fire hydrant after crossing across the lanes onto the opposite side of the road. And when i say hit it i mean full force 30mph smashed into it. Somehow I Miraculously came out with just a small abrasion to my neck from the seatbelt. What scared me more was te 14yr old girl who is like my lil sister was in the car when i started to act funny and drive crazy. Somehow in my fucked up state of mind i rememebered to drop her off (thank god!!) so she wasnt in the car when I crashed. But my god i could have killed her i feel so guilty and embarrassed. I know it easnt my fault not like i knew it was low and then drove. As it said it came on suddenly out of no where without a single warning... but still. So yeha like i said by some miracle i managed to 1. Not kill anyone 2. Not hit anyone or any other cars and 3. Live through it. I came out with just that small abrasion on my neck nothing else no smashed up face no broken bones. Im still in shock and slightly traumitized even though i dont recall it. I think thats what makes it worse is i dont remember anything at all. Fuck diabetes this disease if fucking awful and i could have lsot my lfe tonight.

Motivation to take control of t1d?,"So I would like to know if anyone has advice or experience with this. 

I have had diabetes for 10 years and I got it when I was 11. I have struggled for a decade to control my diabetes. My A1C is 12, I’m almost always high (300+), but despite the concern of my friends and family I feel alone and unmotivated to do anything about it. I have an inPen (essentially a Bluetooth insulin pen) and a dexcom, but it’s not enough. I forget to take insulin regularly and recently I’ve been forgetting to take my long acting insulin too. On average I take insulin once or twice a day and unless I’m wearing my dexcom I’m usually just spitballing the amount I need. 
Dexcom helped for a while but now I’ve found that if I’m high for too long, my sensors fail. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to take control because I know how this turns out if I don’t change, but I just can’t seem to make it a priority.

First Reddit Post Ever,"Very new to reddit and this sub especially. Was diagnosed with Type1 at 13, now going to be 20 in a few months. When I was first diagnosed I genuinely tried to build a routine and take care of myself. I almost considered it a blessing. I hadn’t taken very much care of myself up to that point in my life, so I saw diabetes as a way for me to start eating healthy and exercising regularly. Unfortunately, after about a year of in range A1C’s, I began to slip out of these routines I built. So badly I just wanted to be a normal kid again. I wanted so badly to go back to eating when I wanted, whatever I wanted. I stopped getting up at a consistent time in the AM so I could take my long acting insulin at a regular time. I stopped testing and taking insulin for my meals completely. These bad habits have continued to this very day. I’ve been on the Omnipod, I’ve switched back to my KwikPens (what I use now, when I do use them) and recently my doctors have had me start using the Dexcom G6.  It was going great for about a month. My BS were in range and when they weren’t, I was taking the appropriate measures to correct. However when my sugars are out of range, the dexcom has a screaming beep that can be heard at 1million mike distances. (Not really, but you’d think so) i have a very hectic life and work schedule and do my damndest to try to watch my health while also not letting it control my life, so I will admit there are time when I know I should correct, but simply don’t have the time. The dexcom is so relentless though. At work it’d beep every 5 minutes for hours at a time, and every time I’d be asked by a coworker, “oh are you going to die?” “Did you eat too many cookies?” “is there anything I can do to help you?” “Can’t you just stop the beeping by taking more insulin?” And I’m sure everyone with T1 has experienced similar questions by those in their life. It just got so frustrating for me that I ended up taking off my dexcom completely. I have an appointment later this week with my Endo, who’ll probably be very curious as to why I haven’t used the dexcom 2 out of the three months since the last time I saw her. I don’t know how to explain the social obstacle diabetes creates for me and how it discourages me from taking care of myself because I feel if ignore it, I’ll be normal again and fit back in like I was before I was diagnosed. It’s especially difficult because she is a T1 Diabetic herself, but has known since before she could speak. I feel like she may trouble sympathizing with how I feel because she has had a routine for herself her whole life, where as I lived more than half my life up to this point without it. 

****I apologize if this post seems like I’m rambling on, this is the first time I’ve ever really addressed how T1 has affected me and my emotions.

Our Healthcare System Sucks,"Hi. I'm a young mother of a barely-out-of-toddlerhood T1D. Rant incoming. 

So. I'm in the US. I left an abusive relationship years ago, one that resulted in my son, a type 1 diabetic. 

Because his dad has chosen to peace out and leave the country, I am the only caretaker my son has. Preschools in my area will not take him (they say they aren't equipped to handle a T1D), and because the only babysitters close by are high school students that I can't fully trust with a medically complicated kid, I can no longer work. Because I cannot work, I had to get my son Medicaid. 

Last week Medicaid dropped my son with no notice. I had filled out all of the paperwork, taken all of the phone calls, and I still received a letter saying he will no longer be covered. I filed an appeal, but was told they would not decide until early August. Until then, they told me I have to pay out of pocket but would be reimbursed if they decide to give him his coverage back.

I went into a panic, because frankly I don't have the thousands of dollars needed so he can go to the doctor and get his insulin. 

Luckily, my partner of the last two years swooped in and offered to do a courthouse marriage in the next few days. That way, my son will get on his insurance (which is great, and would even cover his CGM). But I'm still not happy because I keep thinking about all of the people out there with kids who DON'T have someone with kickass insurance waiting to marry them. If I didn't have my fiance, my son would either need to go to the hospital as soon as the insulin he's using stopped working because I can't afford more, or I could go to Walmart and try to learn the new dosing system for their insulin, or I could have a very very sick kid. Why is our government okay with this? What are other families without my luck supposed to do? And is there anything I can do to help them once I'm financially stable again, because I would do anything to stop another person from going through this.",diabetes_t1,1560492666,SpecificNeedleworker,15,11,True,2019-06-14

Extremely high sugars for no reason,"Long read. Thanks for any support or advice or thoughts. 

Was diagnosed in August 2018.

Ever since diagnosis my sugars have been great, except for frequent lows there for a while, and have gained weight because I was feeding my insulin for like 6 months. 

Here for the last few months my sugars have been really great, like in the 115 - 140 range, which is really comfortable for me. I still eat spaghetti, pasta, pizza, bread, cheese burger, drink beer.. whatever... You name it, I still eat it and sometimes have to give myself extra insulin, sometimes do not. Truly feel like I've just been living a normal American life, with the exception of injecting every day, of course.

So uhhhh idk wtf is happening today, but for lunch I made myself a salad. My sugars were only at 101 so I didn't bother with insulin. Didn't end up eating my salad because I didn't like the salmon in there, so I tossed that and ate a banana instead. Again, no insulin for lunch, so I didn't feel the need to really eat something anyways. 

Now ""no insulin for lunch"" is probably the key words right? Well, for like my entire diagnosis I hardly ever give myself insulin for lunch, and if I do.. I only need like 6 units. My sugars are never high at lunch or for dinner. My highest sugars are normally in the morning and HIGH for me is like 160. 

Before dinner tonight I tested my sugars before I took my insulin, because I actually felt low. Well turns out I was just hungry because I was at a whopping 268. WTF. All I ate between lunch time and dinner was a freaking banana. 

So since I was eating Mac n cheese for dinner and my sugars were already high, I gave myself 15 units of insulin (I'm in the US, so idk if that makes a difference on units). I know 15 is a lot, but I panicked. 

About an hour a half after dinner I checked again, to see what my diabeetus was up too. Wow.. 265 this time. I gave myself 10 more units, to try and get this under control. (I'm terrified of going into DKA. been in the ICU for 5 days due to DKA). 45 minutes later I check again and I'm at 263. (Literally only went from 268 to 263 after 25 units of insulin)

He encouraged me to try again and so I did, and guess what, it happened yet again. Again, he helped take it off with minimal pain and told me to keep trying (bless him). I thought why not, I’ve already wasted 20 days worth of sensors.

Inpen question,"Hi all, 

The range of pens available for MDI in the UK is pitiful. Generally they are like something stuck in the 90's: No Bluetooth, no dose memory, no time and date stamps. The novopen echo is about the most advanced available which explains how backward it is. It is a pity and while being type 1 over here at least costs you nothing - not 1 single cent - the level of technology available is really sub par. Because everyone gets everything it makes it unaffordable to offer CGM and pumps to the masses, only to the select few that meet criteria. 

Now finally we are able to get Libre I on the NHS and the criteria are relaxed enough that &gt;25% of UK Type 1's should qualify but no sign of any pens being approved. Is it possible to buy an Inpen while I am in the US later this year and take it back to UK with me would anyone know?

I have bipolar disorder which means sometimes I struggle to take care of myself, but I’m stable at the moment and so last night when I woke up with a headache and a thirst that couldn’t be quenched, I almost let old habits die hard and reached for the Novorapid—but then I shook my head and grabbed my meter, and I’m glad I did.

My diabetes cooperated today!,"I was out longboarding today and planned to cruise around on a bike trail for 5 miles. I was at 145 before the trip, so I packed some poptarts and water and was good to go.

On mile 4, I came to a river crossing that was flooded, so I had to completely turn around and go back the way I came. My 5 mile trip became 8 just like that.

Today is the last day I take my insulin.,"I'm done. No more Apidra, no more Levemir. I'm done. DKA can take me, and hopefully death will be quick this time around.

I've only been diagnosed since early April this year — two weeks into a new, shitty, barely-minimum-wage job that has me working 6 days a week with seniors and managers who would rather play passive-aggressive mind games than actually look for productive ways to fix problems — and I'm tired.

I'm tired of people telling me I got my T1D from eating too much sugar. I'm tired of people telling me all I have to do to be less stressed out is ""stop worrying \[about the diabetes\] so much"". I'm tired of people thinking T1D management is basically akin to taking a bunch of pills at mealtimes.

I'm stressed out and nobody understands anything; nobody wants to listen to anything I have to say. I skip meals. I binge eat. I gained 10kg in 2 weeks. Finished a 300-unit pen in 5 days, when one previously lasted me over a month.

But hey, it could've been worse, right? I have no right to complain at work, because I'm still new and learning the ropes. I just gotta suck it up, right?

And I have to right to complain about my life, right? Because hey, I could be working one of those shitty below-minimum-wage jobs that people from developing countries come to my country to do, where they work 14-hour shifts for 14 days in a row and barely get a half-day off at the end of it, right?

There is nothing left to this life. Might as well inject all of the remaining 200 units of Apidra in this pen tonight. I'm done.",diabetes_t1,1560075266,Fridenot,25,3,True,2019-06-09

First off, I’d like to thank everyone talking about the Keto diet on this subreddit. I took it up 2 weeks ago and my blood sugar levels (BLS) have stabilized drastically.

Brother maybe diagnosed,"So this is currently unfolding but I have had type 1 for almost 20 years. I was diagnosed around 10 years old after a week of feeling sick, dehydrated, and peeing in my sleep.  

My younger brother (now 24) has been experiencing similar symptoms and went to a doctor today.  They admitted him after testing his blood sugar and a1c.  BS was 380, a1c was 13.   

My mom is with him and said they sent him home with a bag of  metformin and told him to watch his diet and come back when another doctor was available to do more tests.

I feel like that's pretty relaxed. When I was diagnosed, it was straight to the hospital for 3 days while they showed me and my parents about counting carbs and whatnot.  Figuring out insulin to carb ratios etc.

I was surprised at how this all played out and was wondering if this seems like a typical approach. I'm sure methods change over time, but we're both very thin and type 1 runs in the family, cant imagine what else it could be.",diabetes_t1,1559859348,LACamOp,6,3,True,2019-06-06

Can a string of High Blood Sugars cause a sore throat/stuffy nose?,"The past two weeks have been really bad for me as far as controlling my blood sugars. 
For some reason when I take my insulin sometimes it doesn’t go into effect, even though I am counting carbs and also correcting my bs at the same time. 
Anyway, this has resulted in a string of really high blood sugars 300+, I’ve even woken up in the middle of the night because of the hbs and not being able to sleep. 
This morning it happened to me again too. I took fast acting insulin for a meal I ate last night, even took a couple of extra units, along with my lantus, before bed my bs was 120, but this morning I woke up with a really sore throat and dry mouth, and slightly stuffy nose. I checked my blood sugar and it was 275. 
I’m not sure why this is happening but it is a bit unnerving. I’m really sad because I’ve finally been at a place where I’ve been taking my insulin on time and actually counting carbs and it’s resulted in really good blood sugars. But for some reason recently my blood sugar has been really hard to keep down to a normal level.

Anyone experience this before?

Please share your tips for lowering A1c.,"Hi guys! I have been struggling with my sugars for some time and my A1C has been hovering in the 9s for the last 3ish years. I would really like to bring it down so any advice/ tips would be very helpful. 

To understand my situation a bit more here’s a bit of background:
1. A few years back a family member’s health was acting up and got diagnosed with a terminal disease a year or so later. I was very close with that person so that was very hard for me. 
2. This lead to the development of depression, panic attacks and TERRIBLE anxiety. 
3. Shit mental health + dying loved one + university = me having very little energy/ motivation to do anything. 

My mental health still acts up every now and then but it is a lot better than before thanks to lots of therapy, meds and super supportive family and friends. 

The things I have been doing to help with my sugars:
1. Do my best to eat well (I’m an emotional eater so that’s a bit hard for me at times)
2. Exercise (I’m not super active or consistent with exercising but I try to go as often as possible)
3.  Do my best to keep my mental health in order (anxiety + panic attacks increase my blood sugars)
4. Upload my sugars on Diasend and see if I can make any changes (they’ve been all over the place recently)

I have just ordered a Dexcom CGM so I’m hoping that’ll help. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 🙂",diabetes_t1,1559783052,sblack97,11,4,True,2019-06-05

Questions,"Hi, sorry for the vague title. I have 2 kinda different questions so I didn't know how to title this.

My first question is, is there any way to make insulin delivery faster? I'm not on a pump yet, I use Humalog throughout the day (1 unit:15 carbs, also 1 unit each 50mg/dL I want to go down) and I've noticed it's *really* delayed. Like, if I have something with 25 carbs and take insulin before, it will take hours before it actually starts going down. By that point I'll be at 350mg/dL before it starts going down, so I'll be high for hours. It's really annoying and I'm just wondering if there's a way to make this quicker? I inject in my lower abdomen (stomach) as well as my leg. I don't really have enough fat to really do it anywhere else, so those are the 2 places I can really do.

Another question, somewhat related but not really, how is the Omnipod Dash? I'm about to get it in a few weeks, and I'm pretty excited but also nervous. Does it help with your numbers, moreso then injecting? I was diagnosed in Oct 2018 and my control with the insulin pens are not great, my a1c is 7 and according to dexcom clarity my average glucose is in the 200s. How much has it helped your numbers? Another thing is, is the alarm loud? I hate when people know that I have diabetes (I'm in high school) and I don't want an alarm going off a lot as that might be embarrassing. So I'm just wondering how the alarms with the Dash are. I do a pretty good job hiding the fact that I have it so I don't want to ruin that.

Anyone else feel like they’re getting no help from the NHS/healthcare services?,"I’m in the UK so for me it’s the NHS, but I’ll be interested to know if people in other countries also have this struggle.

I’m incredibly frustrated at the moment because I feel ignored by the NHS. The last time I saw a nurse, she said she was going to refer me to get an insulin pump and told me I’ll get a letter in the post with an appointment/more info. That was over a month ago. I’ve been off work sick today because my sugars have been very up and down, and I feel like crap. So I called the health centre to chase up this referral, they said they would speak with the nurse and call me back. Now it’s the evening and I’ve had no call.
I’ve been diabetic 9 years and it’s always been like this. I was diagnosed at an awkward time when I was almost 18 so I was sort of treated as a juvenile and had constant contact with a nurse, it was fantastic. But soon after, I turned 18 so I was no longer under the care of that team, and then I moved across the country to go to university and I don’t think my medical history came with me. Everyone assumed I had been diabetic forever and needed no help. A nurse was once really nasty to me because I didn’t fast for a hba1c blood test, she soon changed her tone when I broke down and told her this was the first one I’d ever done and nobody told me I had to fast! (I’ve also never had to fast since then so not sure what that was all about).

I’ve been referred to the specialist team numerous times and get great care for a couple of months and then somehow slip out of the system again. The nurse I saw last asked me who my diabetes consultant doctor was and I couldn’t answer, I don’t believe I’ve seen a consultant since I was first diagnosed. I’ve learnt more about how to manage my diabetes from people on online forums than from doctors or nurses.

I guess I just needed to rant somewhere. My physical and mental health is suffering because I’ve not been getting the care that I need, and I’m kind of scared for my future.

sudden insulin resistance,"hi so I crossposted this onto r/diabetes but  I'm about 10 months diagnosed (I'm 23) and I've always been pretty insulin resistant to begin with (my ratio is about 1:5 all the time) but within the last 2 months I have not been able to keep my blood sugars under control. from watching my g6 I know that it's a problem with my basal level but what I'm mostly concerned about is that I seem to need to raise my basal level about once a week now. Amounts of insulin that before would have worked fine or been way too much, do nothing to me. My lifestyle hasn't changed and I eat less than 110 carbs every day. I'm not really sure what could be causing it, and I'm wondering if it could be something to do with my thyroid (my levels at diagnosis were fine but they haven't been checked since). I also have noticed myself being more moody/depressed/angry and having less energy.

Diabetes and childhood trauma,"A long-term study conducted by CDC (among others) studied the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and autoimmune disorders, founding them to be correlated:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318917/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318917/) 

This is in line with findings linking type 1 diabetes in particular to childhood stress, such as  [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17550217?dopt=Abstract)  and  [this metastudy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11892-016-0740-8). I looked over the questions used in the first study linked and found my ACE (=adverse childhood experience) score was 7 - nearly the highest possible score, and even so, all those events covered by those questions amount to around a fifth of my childhood trauma - maybe a third if I'm being conservative.

This led me to wonder how others here score on the ACE test in the first study, and whether you believe this might have caused or played a part in your autoimmunity",diabetes_t1,1559534614,Kalcipher,7,7,True,2019-06-03
SO just got his first insulin pump.,"I'm so excited for him!!

I'm glad there's so much technology out, and more coming out hopefully, to help diabetics with management so you all can have an easier life.

He's still in the ""where do I want to keep it at??"" stage for the actual pump, especially since he has to wear a tucked in shirt at work. I'll probably open a seam towards the top of his pocket so he can keep it on his pocket, but thread the tubing under his pants and shirt. Any advice on people's preferred tubing situation is appreciated!

It's so cool pumps are becoming more advanced in reading blood sugar tendencies. Hopefully this will help him figure out his insulin sensitivity a bit more thoroughly (right now his dosing is usually 1 unit per 50 carbs, but it's a bit different depending on time of day).

I was just so happy and didn't have anyone except for him to share this with, so I thought I'd post here too (: I can't wait to see all the things that will keep happening for y'all - even if it has been talking longer than hoped for by many...

"Dexcom G6 complaints: bleeding, bruising, and sensors failing on first day","I’ve had the G6 for almost a year. Before this I had the G5 for a year. My first three months with the G6 were absolutely awful. I almost switched back to the G5. 

I hate the new inserter because I almost always bleed. I never had much bleeding/bruising with the G5. With the new inserter, I’ve had blood dripping out of sensors. I’ve found that if there’s more than a slight drop of blood, the sensor will fail.

Speaking of sensors failing, I had almost my entire first 3 month shipment replaced one by one because of sensor failures. When I say “failure” I mean that within the first 24 hours the numbers are very inaccurate, so I try to calibrate, and it gets stuck giving me multiple calibration errors. When I’ve discussed this with tech support, they called this “failing.” I NEVER had a single calibration error or failure with the G5. 

I even had a “no restarts” error after putting in a brand new sensor with new code. The dexcom rep I talked to was just as perplexed as I was. 

One day, I went through FOUR SENSORS because they kept gushing blood and failing. I actually blew a vein and caused severe bruising. That bruise lasted six weeks, and there was a faint mark on my skin for the next few months. The day that happened was so stressful.

I feel like at times in the past maybe I haven’t been understanding enough of his condition, we’ve been together a year but I’ve known him for 5, and he’s always dealt with it very graciously. He’s never complained or made an issue. I guess that meant that I just underestimated how crap it is for him. I’ve never actively done anything to be mean to him, I just feel that at this point I should take a real interest.

I desperately want to help him with this. I know his diabetes isn’t going away, but if anyone has any tips or tricks on how your partners help out I’d love to hear. I recently found the tip here about the eyelash glue and he was thrilled as his pods have been falling off for an awfully long time.

He also struggles with the life expectancy element. He’s read that it’s likely to knock 20 years off, and it honestly breaks my heart. He uses it to drive him to do things, and works out very regularly, eats a vegan diet. He keeps an extremely strict schedule because he says he’s conscious he has less time. It absolutely kills me. I understand that this drives him but I worry about whether it stands in the way of him being happy, I just wish he was able to get this off his mind but at the same time as someone without diabetes I don’t know if it’s fair of me to feel that way. I really just want him to be happy.

Does anyone know whether this statistic is accurate? Obviously as time progresses and medical science improves, people can manage their diabetes better and I just question the extent to which this remains an accurate statistic.

Dexcom Users - Looking for advice," 

Hey, fellow T1s! So I’ve been using the Dexcom G5 for the past 5 months now and am absolutely in love with the amount it has helped me control my disease. Aside from the massive positives though, is the negatives. I’ve had an insulin pump for 20 years now, and commonly put it on my stomach. Luckily the infusion set is relatively flat, so I never feel self-conscious about it. 

Now to the cons of Dexcom. Ever since I’ve used the Dexcom, as a side effect of my sugars improving, I’ve also put on about 10 lbs in total. For someone who has barely gained 5 lbs since high school, this has sent me into a shift where I no longer feel comfortable with my body image. My husband is very sweet and encouraging about it, reiterating how beautiful he thinks I am, and also noting that he’s got no problem if my boobs and butt get bigger (lol!). To make matters worse about this shift in body image, Canadian regulation requires that you put the Dexcom on your stomach. This lovely device is quite chunky and I can see if poking out like a big tumor in EVERYTHING I wear. It sucks. 

So, I’m trying to come to terms with and adjust to this new body, but am wondering if any of you have any suggestions on how to deal with this change in feeling, or any suggestions of where else to put the sensor that disguises it better? Especially as a female. I don't know if it's the same way in the states, but Dexcom won't confirm any other good places to put the sensor other than the abdomen, so they haven't been any help in that regard.

Low carb diet.,"Hello. I have been thinking about going on a low carb diet. About a year ago I tested it for about a week, my blood sugar was really stable and I didn't experience any problems with it. I noticed that I had low amounts of ketones during this time, but I figured that is normal due to the body burning fat. 

When I was at a routine check up at my diabetes nurse, I mentioned that I was interested in going in a low carb diet permanently. She didn't really say much about it except that it increases the risk of going low. She also recommended that I should talk to a dietician first. I agreed and she set up an appointment for me.

The dietician advised against me going on a low carb diet, saying that I need to have a certain intake of carbs for my liver to be able to store glucose, and that it is very dangerous for someone with type one diabetes. I have read a bit about low carb diets and I know that the body can turn protein in to carbohydrates and that as long as the body gets enough insulin, ketones should not be a problem. I have also read about type ones who successfully eat a low carb diet, so I don't know what to make of her advice. She is a professional dietician and has no reason to lie to me, but she was basically saying that someone with type one diabetes can't live on a low carb diet, which isn't true. 

If you have you talked to a dietician, nurse or doctor about this, what did he/she say about it? I am still interested in changing to a low carb diet, but I am a bit cautious due to the dietician being so strongly against it.

Reduced my hba1c after years of it being at 7%,"I started using a Freestyle Libre about 18 months ago; before that I had always just used blood test strips. I've had diabetes for almost 15 years now and for most of that time my hba1c has been at 7.0% or higher. It's now down to 6.6% and has been steadily decreasing ever since I started using the libre. This thing is great; makes managing diabetes much easier; I'm aiming to bring the hba1c down to 6.4% by the time of my next clincal appointment.

 I'm so grateful to the NHS for providing this for free; as it is likely going to improve my overall health considerably. I always feel so bad for you guys in the US when I see posts about running out of insulin and/or not being able to afford more; makes me really learn to appreciate the NHS in the UK. Before the NHS offered something like this I looked into buying one myself and I immediately saw that it would be far too expensive for me to afford. 

Anyway thought I would just share my happiness in bringing down my hba1c after it being consistently slightly too high for a long time. Has anyone else recently starting using this or something similar? Has it been as helpful for you as it has for me?

Am i meant to inject for snacks?," Hi,  


A bit ashamed to be asking this as i feel its something i should definitely know, but here goes. (The quick acting insulin i use is Apidra)  


What is the protocol for injecting with snacks? So tomorrow im going out for lunch at 1pm, which means ill probably be eating, and injecting, around 1.30pm. Now, as far as i was aware (may be wrong?), when i inject apidra its effects last 4 hours. We are going to the cinema at 3.30pm, if i get popcorn and a drink or whatever, am i able to inject 2 hours later to account for the carbs in this snack? Ive never really been sure. Part of me thought i remembered hearing that if i inject again that soon after, that it could react with the insulin still active from my before lunch dose, and cause me to have a hypo. But if that was the case, then surely that would mean i can just never snack... which seems unlikely to be the case....! Or maybe is there some different way of calculating the correct dose to use for snacks?  


I hope what im saying makes sense, and hopefully someone can shine a bit of light on the subject for me!

Carb to insulin ratios,"Tl;dr I’m curious how many units of short acting insulin everyone gives based on the number of carbs

I was recently diagnosed with type one diabetes in March 2019. Initially my doctor said for a regular meal of 50 to 70 carbs, give myself three units of insulin unless my blood sugar is within a variety of ranges(https://m.imgur.com/nvbiIz8)

But last week something changed. I feel like I need to give myself a unit of insulin for every 10 g of carbs, but I don’t want to knock myself out so I’ve been doing half of whatever the number is, so I’m just going high.

For example, last week I didn’t eat my snack at 11 AM and my lunch isn’t until 1 PM. I was going low by the time it was lunchtime, walked in the break room and there was pizza! I completely neglected my lunch brought from home and proceeded to eat three slices of pizza. When I look at the carbs after I ate the pizza, it was 120 g, I think.

Taking your insulin in front of other people.. do you remove yourself if it makes them uncomfortable or tell them to pound sand?,"tl;dr at the bottom

I suffered DKA and received my new diagnosis exactly a month ago (see my post history for the whole tale). I was initially very uncomfortable with the idea of taking my insulin in front of people or in restaurants but that was mostly due to the fact that I have never been comfortable showing my stomach in public (use to weigh 300+lbs, and now having lost 135lbs I have extra skin and still have tons of stretch marks.)

I got over it quickly. My loving fiancé reminded me that no one should be judging me for taking my life saving medication. We like to eat out and have never had any reaction beyond maybe a little sympathetic smile from a stranger.

So, last week I'm at my book club that consists of a group of close friends and fucking Brittany. Before this incident I've never been a huge Brittany fan. She's nice enough but just completely self centered. She has a chronic need to make everything about her, often derailing book conversations to tell some totally boring story about herself that has nothing to do with the discussions. 

9 PM rolls around and it's time for me to take my Lantus. I pull out my supplies kit and discretely as possible prep to take my dosage.
 
Cue Brittany- ""oMg r U taKinG Ur iNsuLiN!?""

Me: ""Yep, I have to at this time every night.""

Her: ""Oh my god! No! I just can't. OMG needles make me so uncomfortable! I could never-NEVER!""

Me: ""Yeah, well you probably could if your other option was dying.""

Her: ""Nope. No. I can't watch this. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to be sick.""

Me: ""Fuck me for having to take my life saving medication??""

I guess it's good that she removed herself from the situation but I don't know.. it's really made me feel down for the past few days. Was I the asshole here? Sometimes when I think about that situation I feel like I was and that I should have just removed myself for 5 minutes if she was really that uncomfortable. Then there are other times when I think about it that I'm just so mad. I have to deal with this every day for the rest of my life and you can't avert your eyes for literally 30 seconds?? I'm sorry that I'm making you sooo uncomfortable using this tiny ass needle that you can't even see because we're sitting 6 feet apart from each other across a campfire in the fucking dark. 

I know this probably won't be the last time I'm in this situation in my life. I've  had many shower arguments planning the things I'd like to say to her when this inevitably happens again but I'm wondering if I should just ""rise above"" so to speak.

PSA: Lows almost certainly will not kill you,"It has come to my attention that many in the T1D community believe that severe lows result in death, even I once believed this. However, I can find no evidence of any death of a T1D that can be attributed to low/severe low blood sugar. While we all acknowledge that it is probably not healthy for us to go below 50/60 for an extended period of time, I have found no evidence that 40-60 causes any adverse effects whatsoever, let alone death. Now it is clearly demonstrated that severe lows (1-30) can result in coma and brain damage, that I do not contest, but unless anyone can demonstrate evidence that a non severe low has been the **direct** cause of any death ever, than I no longer feel the need to fear lows as much as I did when I was first diagnosed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I understand that 1-30 can cause damage to the body/brain, and possibly, although there are as far as I can tell only statistical associations and assumptions that indicate this, death.

All of a sudden in March when my prescription renewed, they tried to charge me a buttload of money and said it wasn't covered by my pharmacy benefits (it never was, it was always under durable medical equipment...). I argued back and forth with them, with my insurance (UHC, which owns OptumRx), and had my doctor argue with each of them, sent an appeal (UHC responded saying they had NEVER denied me the Dexcom), sent prior authorizations, resent the prescription to CVS. A lot of this went down during my first foreign vacation since diagnosis too -.-

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I went back to Dexcom themselves this week, and they got back to me Friday saying they'd gotten acknowledgement I was approved by my insurance, and I just needed to pick a supplier. They listed Edgepark, Bryam, and Edwards and said I should contact whichever one I want to use and then call Dexcom back so they can forward an authorization or somesuch.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, to get past the complaining about how horribly, impossibly bureaucratic (""well I can't answer that, speak to that person who will say to speak to me"" endless loop) health insurance companies can be...are any of these three companies distinctly better than the others? Are they each equally bad? I've seen in passing a lot of complaints on this sub, and get the feeling I'm gonna miss the simplicity of a 3 month supply arriving on time every quarter from OptumRx...but at this point even using each sensor for \~16 days since January, I'm starting to run out.

my type 1 story,"Just want to share my story because i feel like i can't share it with someone irl who understands. I got diagnosed diabetes type 1 in 2013 when i was 22. At first it was a shock and this shock made me change some of my habits. I read about alternative treatments such as changing your diet. I went vegan, ate mostly vegetables and raw, i ate about 100-150g carbs a day. My bloodsugar level was pretty good for a while and i was really confident. I survived with no insulin for a while until suddenly from one to the other day my blood sugar level didn't go down how it did before. So i started to take insulin again. Because my bsl was good i started to eat more carbs and i needed to take more insulin. 

In 2015 i left to travel asia/europe with my ex-girlfriend. At that time i was used to take insulin before every meal and take the basis insulin daily. Confronted with strangers almost every day, getting invited for lunch/dinner etc. or just having a drink made me to be not so so consequent with taking the insulin. At first i thought it's ok and it was ok for a while. But it wasn't. I didn't want to explain myself everytime when i have lunch or dinner with someone new. I didn't accept the fact that i have diabetes and that i'm bound to chemicals for the rest of my life, i realised that only later. And i'm still not sure if i accepted it 100%. Everytime i did something 'bad' for my diabetes i thought 'no worries, you gonna change these habbits sooner or later'. 

It's strange, diabetes, it's always here but you never really see it, it's like a ghost, you know there is something but only numbers tell you it's real. I was travelling for about one and a half year. The last 7/6 months i travelled alone, and more than once i rewarded my self with sweets (which i would never ate before diabetes) because i thought now that i'm alone and nobody sees it it doesn't count. But it did. When i arrived back home my first week i spent in the hospital because of a Ketoacidosis. That was in fall 2017. Then i thought ok now i have to change. 

I did for a while. But then 2018 came, summer came and i got accepted for art school. I was checking my hba1c regularly and it was never really good (around 10/11). I kept telling me i will change my habits and start to have a healthier life style soon. I dont't talk about my bad levels with other people because i feel it will disconnect me from society, or from social activities. 

I'm a student now, i sit a lot. I go out a lot, drink a lot (mostly beer). There are less days in the week where i don't drink. I take drugs at parties and come home early in the mornings or afternoons. I don't have regular meal times, sometimes i eat after midnight when i come home, sometimes i eat almost nothing the whole day, sometimes i'm just snacking. My blood sugar levels are a mess and i need a lot of insulin. I don't count carbs or anything, i just inject what i think is necessary. Mostly i'm wrong. I haven't been to the doctor to check my hba1c lately cause i moved city. Most people from my surroundings tend to drink a lot (art students) and i think alcohol is more or less a big problem in having diabetes under control. When i'm drunk i care less. I was thinking about quitting alcohol but change to other substances like lsd (micro dosing or so). I don't know if it would be a good idea. 

It's pretty clear what i should change. But it's not easy. It makes me sad, makes me feeling helpless and i still pretend everything is fine. Since a few months i have a small round spot in my sight. It's getting a little bigger lately. I'm observing it. I don't want to get blind. It creeps me out. I only talked to one of my friends about it. I don't want to be the 'special case', i just want to enjoy life like everyone else is doing around me. But i can't. I pretend i do enjoy but everytime i consume something, food, drinks etc. i feel guilty. It's a feeling which came with the diagnosis of type 1.. 

i don't know what i expect on sharing this here but maybe it feels good to write it. sorry for my english, it's not my native tongue.",diabetes_t1,1558732696,odemdot,8,4,True,2019-05-24

Type 1 infusion pump and infusion set satisfaction survey.,"Good afternoon r/diabetes_t1 !

My name is John Wilcox and I am a fellow type 1 diabetic and the founder and CEO of Diatech Diabetic Technologies. We are a medical device startup that is creating a realtime alert system for when insulin pumps get blocked up, start leaking, cannula kinks, etc. I know that many people including myself have dealt with the frustrating issue of our pumps (I use an OmniPod), not delivering the bolus we set and wondering why we're going high. Check out our solution in the making at [https://www.diatech-solutions.com/research-design](https://www.diatech-solutions.com/research-design)

Just had my scariest low and I'm still freaking out,"So I was diagnosed 2 years ago at the age of 27 and am now 29

I spend a lot of time at my girlfriend's apartment because it's closer to work than my parents house. 
Her girlfriend picked her up to go to dinner and I went out on the second floor balcony. I've had 3 beers and had a cigarette, I snuffed it out and tried to go back in. The door some how locked and I couldn't get back it. Due to freaking out and sweating profusely my blood sugar was dropping rapidly.

My phone was inside so I couldn't call for help and started to panic real hard. I asked a couple of foreign ladies who we're walking by to please go to the office and ask for them to help me out. They slowly walked back to the balcony and said ""so sorry, no one in office, bye"" and walked away before I could ask them to call for help / police or something. 

My girlfriend has a planter box that I took off the balcony and grabbed a couple metal pieces off of it to open the door as wide as possible and I used the other one to pry it open even more. The piece that that door hooked into broke and the door cracked open. Luckily the glass didn't break.

I ran inside and ate 6 mini kit Kat bars as I sobbed. I was so frightened and feel so helpless. After 10 minutes of getting myself together I went to check my blood and I was at 100. 

Luckily I'm good with mechanical things and was able to break back into the apartment. But I have never felt so scared / helpless in my life and I am terrified now.

2nd day on Guardian sensor rather disastrous,"Hey fellow T1’s! Got my brand new Medtronic Guardian CGM yesterday, went through onsite training at my doctors office, and was a little concerned with the growing pain in my arm where it was inserted. The pain woke me up in the middle of the night, and this morning I removed it. I think it’s normal to say as a Diabetic I have a high pain tolerance, I feel like I have to I guess, so I was surprised. All day my arm has continued to feel on fire and uncomfortable about 4 inches above and below the insertion site. 
My trainer said it wasn’t supposed to hurt, that she’d never had it hurt anyone, and, I quote, “to enjoy the journey of experiencing a new CGM.” She said the arms are the best accuracy, but that I should try my stomach since my sites are there and maybe my tolerance is higher.

What are your keys to success? I’ll share mine.,"1. Low carb diet- I can’t stress this enough, I’ve been into fitness since I was diagnosed. This means I’ve bulked, cut, maintained weight etc. All through various dieting methods, low carb is by far the best method to control blood glucose levels. If I keep carbs below 50/daily it almost is as if I don’t even feel like I have diabetes. My numbers never go above 170 if I do this, as soon as i fall off my diet the numbers reflect that.

2. Exercise regularly- I haven’t stopped exercising, I contribute this to having some success during the times I am not as dedicated to control. I lift 5-7x per week for about an hour and do 30-45min of slow paced cardio per day. Now the only thing I have during the exercise is a spike in blood sugar, which is odd and I guess per my endo not too uncommon in some. 

3. Test, test, test- no matter how crappy it is to always have to do this, it is the key to maintaining control. I have a CGM and it is nice, but I do not use it regularly. Nothing beats the actual finger sticks, the cgm is great to give a ballpark figure but it’s personally hard for me to wear two sites at a time. 

4. Stay away from drugs/alcohol - this was my downfall at times, I’d drink or do other things and eat things I shouldn’t, forget to bolus or test and I’d pay for it. These things also wreak havoc on your body, they tear down something that is already compromised.

5. Learn your body when it’s going low/high- this one is tricky and varies person to person. The reason why I just included this is due to one thing I’ve picked up on that is consistent, whenever my blood glucose is high while sleeping I am restless/have insomnia. This trend I’ve noticed has saved me several times during the night from exposing myself to prolonged high blood glucose levels.

Are there any US Freestyle Libre users on the sub using the android Glimp application?

I expect that I would not be able to read a Glimp S initialized sensor with the Abbott reader, as mentioned in its documentation.  But does using Glimp S work at all with the (specifically) US sensors from CVS/Walgreens?

Reason I am not sure is that the US sensors/reader appear to use some different data encoding or perhaps a cipher key, as I cannot read Abbott initialized sensors with Glimp - it returns a data decoding error - while I watched a Canadian do this yesterday.

Finally, if anyone from Abbott is reading: stop it - get some help.  I need to track insulin on board and your ecosystem doesnt let me, but Glimp does.

Pump Choices,"I have an older generation pump. I recently took advantage of the Medtronic trade in program to get their newest system. I reviewed the manuals and researched and decided that it wasn’t for me.   Their returns process made me mad so I started looking at the competition. Something I had never done before. What I found was that I don’t see anything currently available that I would want when I compare to the older generation that I have now. 

With that said, in doing my research there were things that came up that I would not have thought to compare had I not had experience with the day to day use of “the pump”.   We each have different preferences. I thought I would throw out some things to consider when comparing systems that would not have come naturally to me. 

Power/Batteries. How does it get power. What do you need to do to keep it powered.  How to you handle it when it runs out of power. Like when you get an alarm as you are carrying luggage out the door to travel to a multi stage bike race. 

Infusion sets. What is available and how do you picture it in use on you in your daily life. Disconnection. Size. 

The what if factor. If my tubed infusion set comes loose or is obviously not working properly and causing a high blood sugar how tough is it to replace and roll on. If non tubed, same thing. 

Filling and replacing reservoirs/cartridges. The entire process of replacing infusion sets and insulin. Seems simple, yet very different between brands. Watch YouTube videos. 

Navigation. Does it seem to have an intuitive interface. Does it seem like it takes 100 button presses to perform simple daily tasks. 


Support. There is a lot of talk about what happened when we called customer support. That is important. But how do you know what you could be getting into before you get in and find out that it is bad. I would suggest going to company web sites and seeing how easy they are to navigate. How hard is it to find contact information and when you have a question instead of online research give the company a call. See what that experience is like and what impression you get of the company.

We are looking to have the research published via [Journal of Medical and Biomedical Discoveries](https://www.gavinpublishers.com/journals/journals_details/Journal-of-Medical-and-Biomedical-Discoveries), however I still need more data - as of right now I have an SQL database with about 130,000 entries of my own data from January 2018 -&gt; Present. Not only do I need more (larger volume of) data, I also need to examine the blood sugars of people other than myself because I cannot imply correlations based solely off of my own data.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are willing to help, here's what I need exactly:

1. I will need you to log in to Dexcom Clarity online, and download/export your data as a .csv. This part is a little tricky though. Dexcom will only allow you to export up to 90 days worth of data at a time. What I request is that you start at the earliest year possible and begin by exporting data from January-February, then March-April, May-June, etc. Please only export data 2 months at a time (I know it's tedious but it's easiest to read this way). Continue exporting up till today.
2. This step is not required, but would be very helpful for me. After you have exported a .csv if you could rename it that would help. When naming it, please follow this format:  clarity\_\_YearOfData\_Month1Month2. As example, if I just exported my 2018 July-August data from Clarity, I would rename is as clarity\_2018\_julyaug . When you rename, please use all lowercase letters, and also please abbreviate the month (if you don't know the abbreviation just type in the full month name and I will abbreviate it once I get it).
3. Once you have that, please put all the .csv files into a folder and zip/compress the folder. Then rename the folder in the format: YourLastName\_glucose. As an example, I would rename my zipped folder hood\_glucose . Again, please use lowercase only.
4. After that, please PM me or email them to me directly at [trhood21@gmail.com](mailto:trhood21@gmail.com). By emailing me your blood sugars, please understand that you are giving me your full consent to view your medical data and use it for research purposes only. In particular, I will be using your blood sugar values and the date-time they occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who has read this and is interested in helping. I really appreciate it! If there are any questions, please let me know.",diabetes_t1,1558656875,t_hood,8,2,True,2019-05-23
Severe lows related to singing,"So I'm an aspiring singer and voice teacher and often sing pretty physically demanding repertoire (rock, metal, musical theatre, opera) and sometimes if my practise sessions last several hours, I will have severe hypoglycemia. I'm talking beneath 2.8 mmol/L  (50 mg/dL) The problem is that this is not always the case. Most of the time my BG lowers only slightly, so I just make sure to eat a few carbs prior to singing. My control is generally great and almost all my readings are in range, except for these lows. Diagnosis was three months ago and this has happened a total of three times.

Also they will creep up on me and be mostly asymptomatic until I'm already quite low. If I feel a slight shakiness I may already be at 2 mmol/L. I will be lucid throughout. The diabetes centre I go to has been entirely unhelpful.",diabetes_t1,1558658246,Kalcipher,7,4,True,2019-05-23

13 year old sudden vision change,"I posted last week about my 13 year old son recently getting diagnosed with T1. It's been a rough week, but we have at least gotten down how to do the basics, and my son is even doing his own finger pricks and injections. 

This morning when I came downstairs my son was wearing my wife's reading glasses, and I thought he was just screwing around. He wasn't. He was wearing them because he couldn't read the label of the cereal he was having for breakfast. 3 days ago he was reading all of the labels to us (because getting old sucks), and now he's telling us that yesterday at school his close up vision suddenly became blurry. He actually took my wife's glasses to school because he said he wouldn't be able to read anything without them.

We talked to his doctor, and she explained how T1 affects all of the fluids in the body, including his eyes, and his vision may swing back and forth for the next month. We ordered him some cheap reading glasses, but I'm hoping it's temporary. My son has always had 20/20 vision, so I hate that he has another new thing to deal with.

Constantly going high hours after dinner. Advice?,"I’ve had a Libre with Spike for nearly a week now. I’ve been trying to keep my blood glucose in range but I’m really struggling, particularly after dinner.

A similar trend seems to be happening each night. 3-5 hours after dinner my blood glucose rises and won’t go down. Dinner is usually my largest meal of the day and is often high in protein and carbs. My usual I2C carb ratio is 1:10 but I think it might we way out.

My basal dose is 48 units of Levemir taken as 24 units each morning and night. This seems really high but my glucose seems to keep rising when there shouldn’t be anything digesting. 

I’m averaging 1:5 Bolus ratio each day after all the adjustments trying to keep in range, but if I do much more than 1:10 at meal time then I seem to go low in the hour or so after eating.

rash on body after significant change,"hey!

i was was wondering about this rash that i get on my body that has to do with diabetes, and wondering if Anyone else had similar experiences.

5 years ago i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, when i came into emergency my glucose was  37.5 mmol/l which is insanely high, after they gave me insulin and my sugar started restoring to somewhat normal numbers, a rash spread around my body mainly on my stomach, my chest and i think my upper arms..

&amp;#x200B;

when the doc saw it they didn't give too much attention, and after i complained sent me to a dermatologist, by the time i got the appointment the rash subsided.

&amp;#x200B;

since then, every time there is a major turn in my glucose levels as well as my insulin injections. the rash appears. 

so for example when my sugar was high at around 315 for around a week straight, when i increased my insulin dose, it appeared again it usually comes in slowly and after around 3 days it  is subsides...

similarly about 3 months ago i went off carbs for around a week and a half, after around 6 days the rash came back and got worse every day. until i started eating carbs again...

what confuses me is that it happens whenever there is significant change and not after just one type of episode.

&amp;#x200B;

i should mention that this is happening with different insulin's which would probably rule out being allergic to one type.

&amp;#x200B;

if anyone ever heard about, or experienced something similar i would love to hear.",diabetes_t1,1558547018,mendelgur,0,3,True,2019-05-22

 I would like the new meter to have the same bolus calculator feature as they makes life so much easier.

Carb Counting Methods and Progress,"I'm starting out carb counting and I'm wondering how long it has taken people to get really comfortable with it and the approach you took.

For example, the dietician started me out counting ""carb choices"", basically using a chart with pictures that represent one serving of a carb. Now I'm starting to read labels and weigh out food for a more granular understanding of the amount of carbs I'm consuming. I'm feeling as though the more I do this, the more comfortable I will be in knowing how many carbs are in a given amount of food I frequently eat. I'm realizing a handful of cashews is about 30g in weight and approximately 9g of carb, for example.

Is this a good approach? How long until you're really in the swing of things? 

Also, the dietician indicated that a few things such as nuts and vegetables are ""free foods"" and I don't really need to count them. But in reality, there are some carbs there that may add up to a meaningful amount. Do you count these as well?

Diabetes and the movies! (Rant),"So I just went and say the movie Breakthrough (Christian movie about a boy who fell through the ice. Bring tissue) as some people might want to watch no spoilers and this does not relate at all to the plot but since it’s a true story is included in the story. 

The mother is overweight. Ok no prob. Lots of people are. At one point she is in the bathroom and test her blood sugar.

At this .2 little old ladies behind me say of course she’s diabetic look at her. That’s Americans for you fat and diabetic the lot of them.

Now I’m like rude. 

Later on. The mom takes too much insulin and goes into a diabetic coma. The doctors do their doctor a thing and while the doctor is explaining the risks of what just happened to the mother when she waken. The doctor says and your type one diabetic.

Now I’m like OK she’s not tied to body weight has a literally nothing to do with it.

Old ladies behind me say see this is what they’re doing. Making it seem OK to be fat. I can’t believe they ruined our healthcare. Thank goodness for Doug Ford ( I’m in Ontario Canada. He is the provincial leader and is cutting lots of medical funds as well as more but that’s  unrelated)

No I’m sitting there continuing to try and enjoy this movie because these two little old ladies keep making comments about diabetes in obesity and the medical strain it is on our society.

It got to the point that I had to leave and get a staff because you know they’re talking crap about diabetes what would a staff member do for that. But because they just keep talking during the day movie that I’m trying to enjoy it and like I said before it’s a very emotional movie having two little old ladies complain about medical care well you know Kid is fighting for his life not really the time or the place.

Still good movie 10 out of 10 would recommend. And the staff got the two little old ladies out so double win.

Still I feel lucky that in this movie daily specify the type of diabetes because let’s be real in most cases they don’t and people have the worst assumptions.",diabetes_t1,1558576327,ecmcgee1997,2,6,True,2019-05-22

I’ve had diabetes for almost 10 years and I’m finally starting to actively take care of myself.,"TL;DR: After 10 years of neglecting my diabetes, I’m starting to take care of myself, and I’m starting a CGM!!

This is long but I’m really hoping it resonates with someone, so we can both know we’re not alone! When I was 10, I (19F) was diagnosed with diabetes after a serious fight with DKA. It was extremely scary, new, and confusing, but my mother and I did a good job of handling it for the first couple of years. 

But then, I reached puberty and was granted with more autonomy than a young adult is typically allowed, because I was a well-behaved kid and my mom worked a lot. I also was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at the age of 13, so I feel like this combined with lack of supervision, led to me not really learning how important it is to take care of yourself. I developed unhealthy habits, and this also meant unhealthy diabetes habits. I wouldn’t test; I’d go 3 months without a single test, but I’d still just take a random amount of insulin and go from there, based on if I felt low or high. At its worst, my a1c has been above 14.

But about 2 months ago (took long enough, right?), I just got so sick of feeling sick. I had no energy, woke up at least 3-4 times a night, was picking fights with my boyfriend whenever my blood sugar was too high, and I was losing weight. Speaking of my boyfriend, we’ve also been dating for 4 years, and things are really serious. We talk about getting married, and I just realized, if I don’t take care of myself, how the hell am I supposed to take care of him? I just finished my first year in college and got straight A’s, so how am I supposed to pursue my dreams if my body is basically... decaying? I was just really ready for things to change, for my habits to change.

So I approached my Endo who is just AWESOME, and told her that I was thinking of the CGM. Since the root of my problems was the absence of testing, why not just attach a little device to my arm that’ll mostly do it for me? She was proud of me for making that decision, and told me about the Freestyle Libre! After some pharmacy tribulations, I’m finally starting it this Friday.

I’m learning a ton about myself, too! Like, the difference that long-lasting insulin makes, from the dosage to the time you take it— ESPECIALLY that last one. I take it before bed now and no longer wake up so frequently.

Sorry this is so long, I’m just so excited to be taking care of myself. Thank you if you’re still reading this.",diabetes_t1,1558486862,apocalipstiick,6,37,True,2019-05-21

Honeymoon period,"Hey everyone,

New to type 1. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago and have stabilized my blood sugar levels. 

I am experiencing what I believe to be the “honeymoon” period of this disease. I was taking 19 units of long acting, and 1 unit of short acting for every 15gs of carbs I eat. I have found that with that regimen, I am consistently going low after meals and with little physical activity. 

The past few days I have lowered both the long acting and short acting insulin and I am still experiencing several lows throughout the day. 

Today, I have takes 0 long acting and 0 short acting while also having ~90gs of carbs including juice candy and normal meals(rice, lentils, yogurt and fruit) yet I am still &lt;80mg/dL. 

My main question is, if my pancreas can produce the insulin needed to manage my night blood sugar, can it also manage the glucagon to manage my low blood sugar?

 I am worried about my lows, and I keep feeling weak before it gets too low, but I am constantly eating and drinking to get my blood sugar up. Even with 0 insulin being injecting into my body. 

Also, if I can’t depend on my pancreas for glucagon, are there any recommendations on dealing with the “honeymoon”. Last night I set an alarm every couple hours throughout the night since I wasn’t confident in my blood sugar staying at a safe level. I don’t want to keep doing this if possible.

I know that sensitive may not be the best word to describe it, but that's the only word I can put with it. 

Whenever I breath in through my nose when my BG is above 200, it kind of feels like my nose is extremely dry, but it's really not. I even smell a particular smell. Nothing too horrible, but everytime my nose feels like this, even without checking my BG, I know it will be high. 

I was curious if anyone has felt this same symptom of high BG, or even has a name to what I feel. I always forget to bring it up to my endo and have been very curious to see if anyone has this same issue.",diabetes_t1,1558400738,pizzadrea,10,9,True,2019-05-20

How dangerous really are post meal spikes?,"If I don’t pre-bolus my blood sugar can spike up to 250 mg/dl an hour post meal, by 2 hours it’s back down to normal. I addressed this with my healthcare team and they assured me that spikes like these were fine as long as you’re back within range within 2 hours. My question is, how true is this? Is there a significant impact on my health if my sugars spike to over 200 even if they do return to normal fairly quickly? 

Just to be clear I almost ALWAYS pre-bolus and can manage a spike, it’s just that when I’m eating out sometimes I’m not able to pre-bolus that early in advance (it takes 30 minutes for my insulin to kick in) so on occasion I do spike like this.

Does anyone experience severe outbursts of anger and feel excessively hot even in cold weather despite having normal blood sugars?,"I got diagnosed at the age of 7. I am 20 years old now. I did not have this urge until recently. My blood sugar levels are relatively controlled. I live in the Greater Toronto Area, where it is not uncommon for the weather to be around -20 degree C in the winters. I can manage with a light jacket and with my head uncovered. Most people my age are shivering in their ultra warm winter parkas with several layers underneath. As I write this, it is positive 10 degrees C outside, my window is open, and I am sweating so much that I cannot wear a shirt. I also get extreme and almost incontrollable urges to respond violently to even trivial inconveniences. Although I never give in to them, they jave become stronger over time. I am a 6'3"", 20 year old, and have no health problems otherwise. I wanted to beat the crap out of my friend the other day when he was slightly late to work on an assignment with me.

Targets in Think Like a Pancreas,"I’m reading the book Think Like a Pancreas by Gary Sheiner. He indicates that a “very tight” A1c range is between 5-6% corresponding to  a BG range of 3.5-8, and a “tight” range is between 6-7% corresponding to BG 4-9.

My question is...do these BG ranges look reasonable?? More specifically is the upper end of the BG range too high? I started with a target range of 4-7 but was just diagnosed and have not spent much time right in that range. Stretching that upper limit to 8 or 9 would help me get some wins.

Also, when I exercise I tend to go hypoglycemic so I'm hoping switching to a pump will help me gain a little flexibility without having to eat tons of carbs before, during, and after.

Currently, I’m 18 y/o, live in Michigan, and am graduating hs in 2 weeks. Been T1D for 8 years, currently on my dads health insurance.

A lot of that is about to change for me. I had planned on moving in with my mom in California , attending community college, and being on her health insurance. I was planning on moving end of July.

My dad is making me move out in 3 weeks to California. He won’t let me be on his health insurance anymore once I move. My mom is an alcoholic and she is in a bad spot rn. I haven’t heard from her in almost a week and my stepdad says the might be losing her job, he isn’t really sure.

I am depending on her for health insurance. We t1d’s need it to survive.  If she loses her job, I have no health insurance.  If shit really goes down the drain for her, I’m planning on moving in with my older brother (also in California) and getting a full-time job until I have enough money to go to community college. I currently don’t have residence there and won’t for probably a while until I can qualify for it.

What do I do for health insurance????? I’ll be employed at whatever place will accept me, being a high school graduate, but I won’t yet be a resident of California, and I’m freaking out about health insurance because without it, my health is in serious jeopardy.

I will be moving to the Davis/Woodland area in about a month. If anybody could get me some advice or help with this awful situation, it would be a blessing.",diabetes_t1,1558310824,zoroarkstar509,12,7,True,2019-05-19

The one thing that always irked me was the old PDM - it's such a bloated piece of hardware. It was always a dilemma when going out: do I stick it in my pocket? Can I afford to leave it behind?

I've been looking forward to the Dash since before it was announced, and I finally got mine last week. To be fair - they did deliver on a slimmer PDM, and for that reason and that reason alone I'll be sticking with it.

But somehow they've made it less intuitive, and every action on the PDM takes longer, with more taps and swipes than before. Bolusing is now a halted process, and they should at least offer the option to disable the PIN lock (the old PDM didn't have one).

Some of these changes were probably added as safety features rather than flaws, but if you're going to add something to a device that is so much a part of our lives make it optional.

Should basal rates vary according to daily bolus?,"I currently use novalog pens for short acting and basaglar pens for long acting. When I was at school I had a routine that was pretty easy to follow daily and I hardly ever started from.

 Now I’m back home for summer and my schedule is compelled different, I’ll be up til 4 and will eat or will wake up late. My daily bolus rates vary widely in the amount of units taken due to the variance in carbs I consume daily. So my question is should my basal rate depend on how much short term I’m using?

Pretending I didn't have T1D for YEARS," Hi! I'm a 21 y/o female and I've had T1D for almost 9 years. I am almost done with college and recently just had a wake up call. I used to be so on top of my diabetes, but then I moved away from home and ""forgot"" I had diabetes almost. Of course i still gave insulin, but not as much as I should, and I definitely never checked my blood sugar. I'm almost too embarrassed to say how little i checked my blood sugar.

I did this for almost 3 years. Treating my diabetes like it didn't exist and when I went home to my parents, lying and saying I've been managing it just fine, and even lying about doctors appointments, etc. Well, about a month ago, I was lying in bed and felt my toes start to go numb.

Next week I'm flying to Boston to participate in the ""DO IT"" program, (Stands for: Diabetes Outpatient Intensive Treatment Program) through the Joslin Diabetes Clinic at Harvard. It's essentially a ""Diabetes Rehab"" and it's top in the country. I just got a new insulin pump, CGM, and my endocrinologist and family is helping me out a lot. A month ago, at my first endocrinologist appointment in 3 years, my a1c was 13.5%, with an average blood sugar of about 400. Today, at my second appointment, My average blood sugar went from 400 to 150. I'm interested in taking steps to improve my diabetes and i'm working on managing it more and more everyday.

Complications possibly associated with T1D?,"I am 29 and was diagnosed with LADA a little over a year ago. I went into DKA with a blood sugar of 600+ ( it maxed out in the ER). After I left the hospital, I was obviously weak and lost a lot of weight along with muscle mass. I noticed about 3 months later that my feet started feeling funny.  It was a burning sensation along with pins and needles. I instantly thought Neuropathy but everything that I had read said that it takes years to develop nerve damage from diabetes. As it continued, I went to my doctors freaking out because I had no idea what it was and of course they told me there was no way that my diabetes caused nerve damage already, so it was inconclusive. Last summer, it kept me from enjoying anything. The hot weather, showers, anything warm made my feet flare up. I had to dip my feet in cold water, or even keep socks in the freezer because I couldn't sleep at night. It has improved over the last 10 months. Over the course of time, I can sleep and the burning sensation is very limited but I still have sensitive/ tingly toes. Does anyone think that this complication could be caused from something else? My endocrinologist told me that if it was improving, it was acute and my nerves are regenerating. He also told me it was very unlikely to be diabetes related, but how do they really know? Does anyone have any recommendations or similar symptoms that could give me some pointers? I would like to hear it first hand from someone that is experiencing the same disease that I am.

T1 Diabetic Redditors Please Help Me verify some of these statements.,"Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this. Ok so a very good friend of mine that I've know for over 15 years has T1. As with most diabetics in our country, there is always an uphill battle on the affordability of  insulin. One of this mornings popular posts was about the ability to purchase insulin from Wal-Mart w/o prescription for $25 per vial (link to post is below). This seems legitimate from the comments that was left. There was a comment saying that the insulin quality might be sub-par, but you just had to be more vigorous at monitoring your blood sugar and it shouldn't be a big deal. I gifted her the Dexcom G5 a year or so back and it monitors continuously. I think the G5 would help mitigate any drawbacks of this insulin, but I am no expert. 

Well any self respecting Redditors knows if you want the right answers, you gotta be in the right sub. So I am here at the elder council to enlist your help and guidance! 

1. Is it true you can get insulin at Wal-Mart w/o prescription?

2. Is said insulin worth the savings cost?

3. Are there other tips and tricks like this that are like best kept secrets only fee know?

Is Humalog bad for pumps?,"So my 12 yo son was diagnosed as a T1 last year.   He got a tslim x2 a couple of months ago, but his BG numbers have been more erratic than before he was on the pump. 

Before he had 7 units of NPH in the morning and again at bedtime as a Basal. And then Humalog as a bolus during the day as needed. 

Now that he is on the pump it’s just Humalog. About 0.4 units every hour as his basal, and the same carb/insulin ratio as before for boluses. 

But we’re finding he can have huge spikes and fast drops. Much more than before. 

We figure some of the issues were getting the infusion set in the right place.  He tried on his leg for about a week and he’d skyrocket at night. So we went back to his stomach. I suspect he may not be getting all of the air out of the cartridge sometimes and that may be causing the erratic ness.   

But I’m wondering if it’s the Humalog itself?  Is that not a good insulin to use in a pump?",diabetes_t1,1557950279,Come_along_quietly,22,2,True,2019-05-15

I told him there's no way. He was almost 120 lbs back in September, and heck he weighed over 90 lbs when he was 8. I confirmed his weight, and then really took a look at him. He was really skinny.

Endo Confession - Something Bad I Used To Do.,"I just wanted to confess something pretty bad I used to do. So when I was 12-16 years old I didn't have the motivation to test my Blood Glucose level often so I ended up having 1 BG test per day or less, and they wouldn't be good BGs either(14-18mmol). To add to this I would be terrified of getting told off by my strict parents and endo during the appointment when they download the results from the meter, and see how infrequent they were.

So, my cunning teenage self came up with a clever workaround to my anxiety inducing problem... The night before the appointment I would wait until my BG level was in a good range, and then I would change the date/time of my meter and test my BG for each day in the past month, rinse repeat, rinse repeat. I would continue this until an additional 75-100 records had been added for the past 2 months. Yes my fingers were sore... So, when they downloaded the data it looked like I'd taken multiple readings per day in range, which was far from true.

During the appointments the endos were always completely baffled as to why my sugar levels were being recorded as excellent, and yet my HBA1C was around 8.5%-9%.

I'm not sure whether I should be proud of myself for being so cunning or should have been more open. I was a scared teenager what can I say. I think endos should make a point of being more understanding, I've no doubt many others were anxious about their appointments and so weren't completely honest, perhaps not to my level of deception...

I am hoping you guys can offer some advice on a good snack to eat before going to bed. I find myself having too many carbs before bed and it ends up raising my blood sugar while I’m sleeping.

Excess supplies,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have extra Medtronic ENLiTE glucose sensors (the implantable part, not the rechargeable sensor) and am wondering how to find a good home for them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF THESE! I simply want to help out a fellow diabetic :)

&amp;#x200B;

I was upgraded to the 670g and it only works with the guardian sensor, so I no longer have a need for the 32 remaining elite sensors. My healthcare is through the VA and it is my understanding that if I return it to them they will be disposed of. While I understand this from a safety standpoint it seems wasteful and Im sure these sensors would greatly help someone out. 

&amp;#x200B;

All individual sensors are sealed but the box of 5 they are shipped in are all open. They were inspected and sealed mid 2017 and I think that makes them technically expired but I do not know the shelf life off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so here is how you can help me find a home for these guys;

1. list organizations that take in diabetic supplies
2. provide websites where I can offer these sensors
3. contact me directly if you live in the Kalamazoo Michigan area and want to pick them up
4. contact me directly if you want them AND are willing to cover shipping costs (if this is in breech of this group or reddit's policies I do apologize and will change the post once I am aware of the violation!)

New to G6,"Hey everyone!  I’m new to the Dexcom G6, and have some questions for anybody with this CGM.
-Do you use a medical sticky tape to keep it on for the full 10-days? Which one, if so?
-What is the deal with water and the transmitter? I can shower with it, can I take a bath, go in the ocean for half an hour where it would be submerged? Is it water resistant, water proof? Have you ever damaged or messed up a site due to water?
-If I do need to remove the transmitter from the site, is there a way to do that? It doesn’t seem like you can just pop it out without removing the whole site.
-Can I use sites that aren’t on my belly? Dexcom G6 manual says just to stick with this, but I have seen youtubers put it on their upper butt and back of the arms.
-If you’re having issues with your transmitter and site, is Dexcom always willing to send more supplies if it’s their error?

‘Feet on floor’/dawn phenomenon problem solved!,"I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else who has this problem. For years I’ve struggled with my blood sugar rising immediately after waking up and continuing to rise until noon. 

Say if I wake up at 6:30am and I was at 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dl), I would take 3 units of Novorapid, take the dog for a 15 minute walk, then shower and get ready for work. By the time I got into work at 8:30 I would have risen to around 12 mmol/L (216 mg/dl). I would pre-bolus half an hour before breakfast and still get a spike, so it was not unusual to be at 14 (252) or higher until a sudden drop right before lunch. 

I ruled out hypos in the night thanks to my CGM, my basal is correct and I take it at night before bed, I tried eating breakfast earlier, changing what I eat for breakfast, not eating etc etc, nothing ever made a difference. UNTIL I decided the other day to take my usual 3 units in the morning, and then eat a small handful of mixed nuts BEFORE taking the dog out or doing any kind of moving around. When I got to work and looked at my CGM meter I was shocked to see a tiny rise and then return to normal. It stayed level until I ate breakfast and a 15 minute pre-bolus actually managed to stop the post breakfast spike. The only problem was that I ended up going low before lunch because now I don’t need so much insulin for breakfast.

I have replicated this today and again I’ve managed to stop my sugar rising!! I’m still trying to work out my breakfast ratio but I feel so much better in the mornings now and I can’t believe the solution was so simple. I had tried eating breakfast earlier but I didn’t realise that I needed to eat before doing any activity. 

Hopefully this might help someone else with this problem! But of course we are all different so what worked for me might not for you :)",diabetes_t1,1557570359,deads0uls,18,45,True,2019-05-11

Seeking advice for overnights,"Hi Folks.

My 11-year-old son was diagnosed T1D last summer. He has the Dexcom G6 and Tandom T:slimx2. He is finishing the honeymoon period due to his rise in Basal dosage and decreasing carb ratios. We live in the US.

We are struggling with getting sleep overnight. We typically have to stay up to 2am to adjust his insulin to control his BG. We were hoping that Control-IQ was going to be a helpful solution, but it appears that his age range will no be included in the first general release. We have been just holding on.

My son likes to have a large dinner. It is his largest meal during the day. We typically finish dinner by about 7pm. We have trouble controlling his BG starting at about 12:30am (just as the dinner extended Bolus is wearing off).  By around 2-3 am, we can get his BG under control and then off to bed for us. The trouble is that we have not gotten a good night's rest since the diagnosis. It is trouble showing up to an 8:30am business meeting under such conditions. It also make business travel difficult.

We have had some successes:

1) We have removed high fat dinners from our diet. We found that over 15 g of fat delays his digestion too much. For instance, we grind our own meat to make low fat burgers. (A family favorite).

2) We moved the daily dessert (30 g carbs) to lunch time. It is easier to deal with during the day.

Our whole family is into food. My wife and I cook nutritious tasty meals and are constantly changing up the menu. My son is a great eater. However, it is challenging to recognize BG patterns when everything is changing. Hence, we are up late every night to deal with the variability.

Dexcom Clarity is telling us that he is typically in range 55% of the time. We feel that this is a good start with room for improvement. 

We are voracious readers of this forum. Thank you for the informative, honest, helpful discussion.

Our questions are how did other folks manage the diet of an 11-year-old athletic boy? What others solutions/tips should we be trying?

670g concerns,"Hi all! I just began using the 670g+guardian sensor system Monday and have an appt later in the month to begin automode-still in manual currently. I have had major issues with sensors so far. The first sensor resulted in ""calibrate NOW"" every 6 hours and failed on day 4 (yesterday). Called Medtronic and they are sending a replacement. I put a new one in this AM and it was working ok until the second calibration 2 hours after the initial-repeatedly got notifications ""BG not received"" then ""No calibration occurred"". Called Medtronic and they had me disconnect/reconnect transmitter to pump and replace sensor, they're sending (another) replacement.

Both of those were on my upper belly, where my CDE recommended I try it-both sensors were ""kinked"" when I removed them. Just placed another sensor on my arm, where I typically wore my dexcom. Felt nothing upon inserting-was actually worried it didn't stick me somehow. But now I can see a pretty significant amount of blood under the gray area beside the transmitter. Is this ""normal"" and will it impact the life of the sensor/accuracy? I am soooooooo fed up with all this already. In 2 years I never had to request a replacement dexcom, all worked reliably for about 14 days. This has not been a great experience so far-I just want to sleep through the night again!!!!!

Do you have a problem or do you want to help other users? Read this before posting! /r/diabetes_t1 newcomer guide,"On this subreddit a lot of people come to ask for help regarding their T1D. It's great that we are here to help each other but it isn't uncommon that the people who want to help need to ask a whole bunch of questions before they can actually help. Here are some tips to help smoothen this process:

1. Don't ask for a diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms of diabetes then you should see a doctor. Diagnosing someone over the internet is generally a bad idea, and it would be hard to determine whether or not you actually have type 1 diabetes. 

2. Don't just describe your problem but describe your situation too. Context matters. The information most often missing from posts is your age, how long ago you were diagnosed, your most recent a1c, your gender, if you use a CGM and if you use a pump or injections. Country or state could be one of those too if your question is about insurance, hospitals or endocrinologists but in many other cases it isn't relevant. 

3. Avoid subjective language. Terms like 'high blood sugar' aren't very clear. What is high to you might not be high to someone else. Some people consider 160 to be high, but I also remember someone who described their fiancée's blood sugar as 'running a little on the higher side' which sounds very modest but she had an a1c of over 14%.

Some tips for those giving advice:

1. Remember that everyone is different. Some people have a more unstable blood sugar than others and what works for you might not for everyone. Don't let that stop you from commenting with personal experience but keep in mind that how you do things is not guaranteed to be the best approach for everyone.

2. Consider OP's situation. Is the advice you give realistically achievable for them? If someone has an a1c of 12% and struggles to inject insulin 4 times a day it might not be the best moment to push them to lowering their a1c to 5%.

3. There is more to life than keto. Many of you had great success with keto, and there isn't anything wrong with sharing that but some resoponses basically boil down to very low effort comments as 'just go keto'.

4. Getting a CGM is a great idea but keep in mind that sadly not everyone can get one. I think a CGM is really valuable to have but a few of you have made it sound like everyone can get one at any given moment. Not everyone can afford them or get insurance to cover it.

Ended Up in ER - Not Sure What Went Wrong,"I developed diabetes as a result of my mitochondrial disease, so while it’s not autoimmune in nature it has caused my pancreas to be non functional and me to be reliant on insulin immediately upon diagnosis.

There I received two liters of fluids and more insulin by iv before my level came down to an acceptable 226. I have no signs of infection, and ate really well yesterday.

iPhone diabetes management tips,"Hello all, 

I just got an iPhone to go with my new dexcom and am interested to hear of any tips or advise for my management y’all might have.

Particularly, I’m curious as to what the best way to track insulin. I’ve been entering my doses into the dexcom g6 app but don’t see a way to share the data with apple health. Is there something else people like to use for tracking that?

It would be nice to add meal tracking with the insulin tracking. Although, I don’t know how to count carbs and need to buff up on that.

I’m tracking my blood meter numbers through the contour app as I got a contour next one for the Bluetooth capability. I didn’t want to mix them with the dexcom numbers in apple health.

I see a bunch of apps but don’t know where to start. Sorry if I’m sidestepping any research I could do but I like to lean on experience of others and am having a time just learning the iPhone in general.

I would mention that I’d like all my data directly exportable in a usable format if possible for analysis within my own spreadsheets. Sending everything to a server is a necessary evil but I was to be able to archive it and correlate with other markers I track.

Fighting with Vendors,"Hi all, I need advice ASAP. I am on day 21 of being without my CGM and am starting to feel hopeless. It's a long story, but this is what happened/is happening:

I recently started a new job, and the last day of my former insurance was on 3/31. New policy went into effect on 5/1. On 4/11, I requested a prescription be sent directly to Dexcom from my doctor, so that I could buy a box of sensors out of pocket. My doctor's office did not read my request, and sent the prescription to my normal pharmacy, which in turn sent it to Byram Healthcare (the vendor I have to use for CGM supplies).

Then Byram, AKA the anti christ, sent me an order (4/16), despite me cancelling a 3 month order of sensors the previous week and without calling me first. As soon as I got the package, I called about returning it. I was sent a return label that reads that the order must be returned within 30 days of the label being created. In the meantime, my doctor's office never gets my prescription to Dexcom and my new insurance kicks in (5/1). 

Once my new policy was effective, I called Byram (5/3) to see if we could run the previous order through my new insurance, since I hadn't sent it back, and they told me no. They also told me that I only had 15 days to send it back from the day it was SHIPPED, and I now owe them $1700. I realized after the call that the shipping label said 30 days, so I sent it back and hoped for the best.

Now, Byram is stating they never received the order and that they can't process a new order until July. Once I figure out where the package is, they're still not willing to take it back because of their 15 day policy. 

ALL this to ask, does anyone have any ideas on how I can convince them to take the sensors (still in the unopened package btw), or an alternative? I really don't want to pay $1700 for sensors I don't have (or at all) and I am terrible at testing manually. Thanks for reading my novel!",diabetes_t1,1557421813,esize95,2,2,True,2019-05-09

I overslept this morning, so had to rush to get to the train station.

After that, I go and stand where the train will arrive and start to eat my croissant.

Oh, no! what do I do?! my train will arrive in a few minutes, but I've already injected for the croissant.

Advice for someone dating a t1 diabetic?,"Hey guys, I’ve been debating making this post for a few weeks now. This is a throwaway account since my SO might also be subscribed and I just want advice on how I could address this before I work up the courage to talk to them.    I don’t want to worry them by being a worrywart myself and hovering. They’ve been so pleasantly surprised every time they’ve caught me educating myself on type 1. I bought a book not long after we started dating and they ‘caught’ me taking notes; they were scrolling through my reddit (I had no problem with this) recently and were surprised to see I was subscribed to r/diabetes. I love them very much and want to do what I can to support them, to encourage a healthy diet and active-enough lifestyle, to cheer them on, to know what to do if they’re ever in need of medical attention.    I’m beginning to secretly *really* worry they may be in a slump as far as keeping their blood sugar below the “high” threshold they’ve got on their pump. Circumstances involving their future career have seemed to have gotten them very down, and they tend to keep everything that’s bothering them just bottled up until they’re ready to burst. I’m afraid to pry because of my own insecurities, worried (irrationally) that I’ll have gone too far and prodded too much and just drive them away. Also I’m worried that my worrying will just make them feel even worse. I’m scared I’m too nosey about it. But I perk up instantly when their pump vibrates that their BG is too high. And I feel ashamed but I peek when they pull it out to bolus, and I keep seeing it in the 300s (mg/dL). I’m so worried. I know it’s not as bad as being too low but it’s still bad, and I don’t know how to address it. They were diagnosed over two years ago and it pains me to have educated myself on all of this and still be tentative about *knowing what exactly* is going on.    Don’t you feel physically terrible when your BG is higher than 200? They seem ok; they’re not doing jumping jacks obviously but they don’t let it stop them from spending time with me and being happy. They’ve gained some weight in recent months, and I’ve chalked it up to stress and to them just trying to keep up with me and be “normal.” They love their fast food and their candy, they get excited to share and binge with me. And as much as I enjoy eating junk food (and for the most part can get away with it, with my metabolism being what it is and my job being rather physically strenuous) I *really* want to have better habits so that we can get into a groove together. I’ve been gently shot down the few times I’ve suggested it, and like I said before: my insecurities about overstepping boundaries keep me from just bringing it up. I’ve tentatively asked how their blood sugar has been, hoping they know I mean how they’ve been doing and how it’s been going because they do seem to be very alone in that regard. I’m not aware of their receiving any support online and they don’t see their endo very often. But when I’ve tried to casually bring up their BG, they’ve answered so shortly and carelessly that I’ve worried I’ve annoyed them by being nosey. I’ve resigned to just not bringing it up at all now, and I cringe internally when I see them gorge on candies and not pull out their pump once.    Here in the last week they’ve started kind of ignoring me when I wake them when their pump buzzes too. I know they’re sleepy and maybe I just don’t fully wake them, but my silly insecurities get the best of me yet again and I’m afraid they’re getting very tired of me insisting they check their pump and bolus in the middle of the night when it’s woken me up. I’m never annoyed by it by any means. Like I’ve said countless times...I just worry.    What would you do, if your SO expressed worry about your levels? Do you talk about it openly? I’ve even showed them funny t1d memes and I’ve gotten mixed reactions that have made me so sad... I just want to make it normal, because it’s a part of their life and it’s never going away, and it sucks and I just want to be here for them. But I’m so uncertain.    Thanks for any input, sorry this is so long and especially sorry if this isn’t really appropriate.

- Humalog (short acting) 
- Basaglar, 24 Units each day, 7:00 pm (long Acting)
- Dexcom G6

I am currently on, 1-10 insulin to carb ratio, 1 unit of Insulin for every 10 carbs...Just want to get an idea of how big of a raise I should expect after a meal.  Typical Day 

Breakfast 
7:45 am – Wake up, 145 BG Reading 
7:55 am – 3 Units of the Humalog
8:10 am – 28 Carb Meal (Honey Nut Cheerios w/milk) 
9:00 am – 240 BG Reading
10:10 am – 140 BG Reading 

Lunch
1:00 pm – 100 BG Reading
1:10 pm – 4 Units of the Humalog
1:30 pm – 43 Carb Meal (Turkey &amp; Cheese Sandwich, Grapes, &amp; Jerky)
2:45 pm – 212 BG Reading 
3:30 pm – 180 BG Reading (Slowly going down through out the afternoon, 110 by 5:00 pm)

Dinner – I typically don’t get much of a raise at all, 30-40 point…(which I guess I would like to see for Breakfast &amp; lunch as well)

Would you consider that a normal increase, 100 points, after a meal like that? Or should I consider giving myself additional insulin to keep that BG reading down. My Dr. has said that this is fine…I just don’t like that 240 reading.

670g Pump Silhouette infusion set-Air Bubbles,"I have been experiencing giant air bubbles, sometimes up to 2 inches long in my tubing. I use silhouette infusion sets, Novolog insulin. I have called Medtronic multiple times and sent them examples of my tubing and reservoirs to test to see what the issue is. I even met with a field rep to make sure it isn't human error of mine when filling the reservoirs and they said I am doing it correctly. They even traded out my 670g pump with a new one and I am still having the air bubble issues.  When looking at the reservoir the top of the blue part looks tilted. So Before filling with insulin I take the blue part off and snap the white part of the reservoir down to line it up flush with the rest of the reservoir. This helps stop the giant air bubbles from being as frequent but is still an issue. Has anyone else had this issue and sent complaints to Medtronic?

Here is the part that scares me, he doesn't want to do it. He referred me to a UW dentist anointined to a hospital. They are going to knock me out for the procedure and take the rest of my teeth out as long as I'm out. Ok, not so bad right? Gimme a second. He doesn't want to do it because there is an extremely high chance of fracturing my jaw and/or permanent major nerve damage. I've only been knocked out one other time and I remember panicking as I was going under and waking up alone and confused. I talked to my Endo and she warned me my sugars could do anything so I need my full pack but I need ideas what to eat. Even if all goes well I still won't have any teeth, just sore raw gums.

Newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic in need of some tips.,"Hi Reddit,

I’m a 21 years old guy from the UK and a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic (I found out a month ago via DKA), and I feel overwhelmed by all the information being thrown at me;  I don’t feel like I fully understand what’s going on. On top of this my father passed away in March, this, combined with my new diagnosis has really got me down and I don’t feel comfortable speaking about this with friends/family. 

I’m constantly getting high blood sugars, even if I’m using insulin straight beforehand and trying to carb count, I keep getting blood sugars in the range of 25-33 mmol, and then when my sugars drop to anywhere below 6 mmol I’m getting symptoms of a hypo, even though I’m nowhere near being at hypo levels according to the information given to me.  Has anyone else experienced this?

I have put on 7kg since my diagnosis, and I used to go to the gym 5 times a week and ever since they diagnosed me, my doctors have said i'm not able to go to the gym as i will affect my BG levels, so if anyone is a gym goer with type 1 can you please give me some tips? 

Also, if anyone could give me any other advice they feel a new diabetic should know it would also be a massive help, as well as snacks or food that you’d recommend as all the old food/drink I used to drink was full of carbs or sugars. 

Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post :)",diabetes_t1,1557131284,2Zig,20,16,True,2019-05-06

Need help trying to understand / budget US insurance,"TL;DR at bottom.


I’m currently planning on moving to the US to live with my partner and I think I’m a little out of my depth trying to understand the whole insurance process and was hoping I could get some help / advice here (additionally, if anybody has also emigrated to the US, any help or advice would be welcome!). 


* We will be living in California. My partner works for a well known delivery company, and will be seeking insurance via them. They use [BlueShield](https://www.blueshieldca.com).


* I currently use NovoRapid and Tresiba flex pens for my injections. I’m happy with this and would like to continue using similar insulins, and especially Flex Pens. I’ve never used a syringe, so the idea of using a vial is incredibly alien to me. Blue Shield list Humalog Kwikpen U-100 and Lantus Solostar, which I understand to be similar to what I’m currently using. Is this correct?


* Blue Shield haven’t been very helpful with us when we’ve been trying to find out more information, are there any decent resources for asking for help and advice about insurance and medical coverage, particularly for permanent residents? I would very much like to know the best steps to take so get the cheapest coverage as quick as possible.


* I currently use OneTouch Verio test strips, these are not listed on the medications, only Accu-Check strips. I’d like to keep using my Verio IQ meter, but am I just shit out of luck and have to go to Accu-Check?


* I understand it varies from person to person, but what is the average per month to expect to pay? Obviously, money is finite, but knowing how much to budget will be very helpful and this is something I’m struggling to find information for.


**TL;DR**: Moving to California from another country. Hoping to get insurance to cover diabetes costs, finding the process and information overwhelming and confusing, ideally would like more information or advice about best practices with US insurance, in particular how much to expect to pay per month to help me budget.

Tired of this disease...,"Hey,  


Some backstory: I've had diabetes (type 1) for almost 12 years now, since I was 6, most of my teenage years I've just mostly ignored the disease, only changing the cannula, sometimes taking bolus when eating. I have the Medtronic  640g if that matters.   
I'm just going to get to the point. I went to the doctors today for a yearly inspection. They took some of my blood, urine, took pictures of my retinas, etc. Turns out my  HbA1c  is over 14.1%. Its been hovering around 10-12% for the last 5 years or so. I don't know what to do. I'm extremely unmotivated and depressed, I live alone so there isn't anyone to remind me to do anything. I've basically ignored diabetes for so long that I don't even think about it at all anymore. I know its extremely dangerous and I could get permanent damage. Still I can't seem to get enough motivation to take care of it. I feel like giving up.   


Could you guys give me some tips, well anything that could help. You are free to ask me any follow up questions, if you feel like that would help you understand my situation better.

All of these alarms!!,"I love the alarms I get from my pump. Unfortunately, not everyone understands the importance. 

I have the Omnipod and the other night I was exhausted and ended up in a deep sleep. (Honestly, I sleep like a rock on most days) and I didn’t hear my boyfriend ask me to check it and I kept sleeping. Needless to say, he was up all night and called me selfish for not getting up to turn it off. 

(As most of you know, the insurance e companies don’t send an unlimited supply of pumps or even insulin. So this results in my alarm going off every 3 days to tell me to change my pump before it expires.)

It’s so frustrating to have to keep explaining this stuff to people when they get annoyed. 
I have to inject myself with so much stuff and watch what I do. Make sure I’m at the doc whenever they need me there, give blood. Have tests done. It’s like, oh and now I have to feel bad my life saving equipment kept you up.  Poor you.

I don't want to do it anymore...,"(I'm sorry this is a long post, but I really need advice). I have been a type one diabetic for ten years and I just have these times where I just want to be done. It's not that I don't want to be alive anymore, I just don't want to live with diabetes anymore. 

I know that I will have it for the rest of my life and when I get this burned out feeling I just want to cry, because it feels there is nothing else I can do. Sometimes it just all feels like so much and I just don't want to do it.

I know that they just don't know what to say, but I am at a loss of how I should go about these feelings. 

It's not fair, it's exhausting, and I'm constantly thinking of it. I know it is a stupid feeling because how stupid is it to not want to deal with the thing that will keep you alive? Right? I know I will always take care of my diabetes, so these feelings are pointless and I shouldn't even pay attention to them. But, when I get these feelings, they are just so hard.

They can leave the house without testers, medicine, snacks, and all the things I have to have or I'd be in trouble. 

*I can’t do that.* Even on the days with the perfect readings, I’m still thinking about it, stewing over my health, trying to enjoy my moments but just not being able to because of counting carbs, a bad blood sugar, worrying, etc.

I was just diagnosed T1 after suffering DKA at age 30 and I'm just freaking out a little bit.,"Apologies in advance for the length, I just need to get this off my chest.

Three years ago I weighed 310lbs and was starting to feel very ill. I was thirsty all the time, constantly peeing, and just overall not well. Before my symptoms started I knew I was unhealthy. I was a morbidly obese 27 year old woman. I'd tried dieting and exercise so many times and couldn't manage to lose weight. I was so hungry all. the. time. I couldn't get enough food, nothing satisfied me. I was very down on myself and depressed for all of my early 20s (not all of this was weight related, had some family trauma, a string of awful boyfriends, etc.). I ignored my symptoms for months telling myself it was all obesity related and I brought this on myself. 

Well, finally, the thing I'd always dreamed of happened. I started losing weight without changing my diet. I was joking with my coworkers about my new ""super power"" but inside I knew something was really wrong. When I lost 40lbs in one month, I finally made an appointment with my doctor (had to find a new doctor because at that point I'd last been seen by my pediatrician) got the blood work done, and received a Type 2 diagnosis. I was prescribed Metformin and Glimipiride. My a1c was 13.1.

My world was rocked. I beat myself up so much. I had done this to myself, I let myself get so fat I gave myself diabetes. It was really rough. But a little self care, and a lot of education later I learned that that's not true, and there are a lot of factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes. (Although, I have to admit while I outwardly preached this I did still blame my obesity and the way I treated my body for my diagnosis.)

I did a lot of research and ignored my diabetes educator in lieu of internet experts (eye roll) and started a very strict keto diet. Within thee months I'd brought my a1c down to 5.3. I was my doctor's favorite patient. I felt better than I ever have in my life (though, if I'm being honest, still not 100%). For what felt like the first time My friends and family were so proud of me. I was the diabetes wonder child! My insurance stopped covering the 4X a day test strips I was receiving at this time, and I SO STUPIDLY stopped checking my blood sugar.

 It took about a year and I lost a total of 135lbs. I've weighed 175lbs for the past 2 years, and as a 5'8 female I've been mostly ok with that. Another 20lbs and I'll be at what's considered a healthy weight, but I still really prefer this body (loose skin, stretch marks and all!) over my previous 300+lbs body. 

The reason I stopped losing weight is probably because I became a lot more lax on the keto diet. I never went back to drinking any sugary drinks, but more carbs slowly crept back into my life. I let myself have french fries occasionally, then maybe some Taco Bell, then a slice of cake on my birthday, a piece of pecan pie on Thanksgiving. For about 6 months I ate a keto diet probably 50% of the time. 

Meanwhile, my a1c was climbing higher and higher. My doctor was lecturing me (the reason I avoided the doctor for 10 years prior) and trying different medications. Then last October I was laid off from my job of 6 years. I completely gave up on myself and didn't care about myself, and fell into a depression, completely devoid of fucks to give. 

I scheduled a doctor's appointment before my insurance ran out and at that time my a1c was 9.2. Luckily, I was able to find a new, better, job fairly quickly but once you go off the rails it's hard to get back on track. I was eating so poorly, lots of fast food, sneaking lots of packaged sweets behind my fiance's back, but still pretending I was eating keto most of the time. (Why did I think it was ok to eat 12 oreos but still deny myself like fruit, yogurt, and whole wheat bread???)

Anyway, to make an already way too long story short- about two weeks ago I started having symptoms of what I thought was acid reflux. Lots of heartburn, that burning gut feeling, etc. I was in SUCH denial. I knew what DKA was. I was constantly hungry and thirsty like when I was fat. I was practically guzzling Zantac and Tums. WHY DIDN'T I CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR??

Then last Thursday, April 25th,  I started having trouble breathing. I left work, went home and took a nap. I asked my fiance to bring me frozen yogurt as I thought it would soothe my stomach. It did but he begged me to go to the doctor. I told him I was fine and I just needed to sleep. I sent him to go play on his PC and even joked to him ""You're going to be so sad if I die"" (just the kind of awful, dark humor that I have) He was like ""why the fuck would you say that??""

The next morning I went to work. My fiance begged me to call out and go to the doctor. I was still struggling to breathe. I was at work for two hours before they forced me to go to a walk-in. I insisted on driving myself. 

At the walk-in I KNOW I filled out all my paperwork correctly, stating that I was (to my knowledge at the time) Type 2 diabetic. I told them I was having acid reflux like symptoms. They insisted I was having a panic attack. I told them no, I know what a panic attack feels like, this wasn't it. I just wanted to breathe normally again. They kept insisting, brought multiple doctors in, and finally decided to run an EKG because of the family history of heart issues I have. 

That's when I had an actual panic attack. Luckily, it came back clear. They sent me home with a prescription for a one-a-day acid reflux medication and some generic form of xanax. I went and got the prescription filled but started feeling a lot worse. I sent my fiance some really loopy texts. He begged me to call someone close by to come get me. I told him I was fine but was starting to get really loopy. I managed to make it home after stopping for more frozen yogurt. 

The last thing I remember from that Friday is my fiance calling, and me telling him I made it home safe and not to worry. 

He found me passed out on the living room floor. I wasn't wearing pants. My phone was by the sink, my purse upstairs, I don't know what was going through my mind. I had pooped myself. My body was shutting down. That night they told my mom and my fiance that they didn't know if I was going to make it.

I woke up in the ICU, bruised to all hell. I spent 4 days receiving amazing care where every Endo who came to see me was certain that I was actually a Type 1 and in complete disbelief that I hadn't been diagnosed sooner. 

Friday I went to my diabetes education where my nurse practitioner confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis. It's been a real rollercoaster of emotions. 

My outer body is still very sore and bruised but I can already tell I feel so much better being on insulin this past week. Emotionally, it's been hard too. I feel so bad for what I put my parents and fiance through. My poor dad flew all the way across the country not knowing if I was going to live or die. They all want to sue the walk-in clinic for not checking my blood sugar but I just blame myself.

Anyway, I feel like I have a million questions but the ones that come to mind right now are:

*How do you guys handle alcohol? Can I still drink? What about marijuana? They don't teach you about this in diabetes education class

*Do you all actually stick to the recommended 60g of carbs per meal? Do you just learn how to take more insulin? I'm getting married next year and want to do the cake tasting! I also have a huge sweet tooth and have just been so frightened of anything sweet.

*Pizza. What do?

*I'm supposed to take my lantus at 9pm every night, what if I'm seeing a movie or something?

*I'm seeing the endo next week. They said I would probably be set up with a CGM and a pump. If I have a choice, is this a good option? Which are the best? General tips and tricks are welcome. 

I think I'll leave it there and save the rest of my questions for my Endo but any general words of advice are sooo welcome. 

One last thought- I watch Fellowship of the Ring yesterday since that's always been one of my comfort movies. When Frodo says ""I wish the ring never came to me. I wish none of this had happened"" and Gandalf gives the famous line ""So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."" I. fucking. lost. it. I could not stop crying. Of course, that line is repeated later on in the movie so I lost it twice. I also lost it when Frodo is stabbed on Weathertop and almost dies because it just really hit close to home more than ever.

Anyway, if you read that whole thing- bless you. Thank you so much for letting me get that off my chest.

A1C higher than pump predicted 670,"I've had the medtronic 670 for about 20 months and after a long and painful adjustment period, I'm in automode about 80% of the time. According to the guardian sensor my average glucose is 143 which would roughly correlate with an A1C of 6.6. My A1C at the endo's office was 7.3 (average glucose of roughly 168). My A1C has always been a little bit higher than the pump predicted (6.8 rather than 6.6) and I've had some issues with the sensor being 15-20 points lower than my meter sugar when I wake up in the morning (ie. it says my blood sugar is 120 and is not currently giving me insulin but when I check it's actually 140) and occasionally during the day so I expected my A1C to be a little higher than what was predicted but I didn't expect 7.3!  Life has also been pretty hectic and I've been a little less diligent about food in the last couple of months (Meaning I eat an average of 155 g carbs/day rather than 130 g and the proportion of fast acting carbs has been a little higher) but I exercise 5-6 days a week, calibrate 3 times a day, and am low only 2% of the time (always during or immediately after exercise) which is a huge change from before starting the 670 when I was low probably 10-15% of the time.

She’s saying how she had no chance of not developing it since it runs on both sides of her family. She’s complaining that she has to test her blood sugar now and take a pill once a day.

I work at a small-town hardware store and we get a lot of elderly people who come in. I got to work around 11 after going to my endo appointment. I was watching the register while another coworker was at lunch, and we were pretty slow during this time so there were maybe three people in the store. I rang an older couple out, they took their things and walked out. Once they left, an older gentleman walked by the register and was sort of grunting and walking a bit funny. I kept my eye on him as he left but once he reached the door I had another customer come up to the counter. I start ringing them out and the couple that I had checked out a minute ago come back in and tell me the gentleman had collapsed in the parking lot. I paged for another coworker to come up front and help me out, so we both go outside and see this guy on his back, kind of rolling around. I took my sweatshirt off and put it under his head. We try asking a couple questions but he isn’t responding so I called 911. I didn’t see any bleeding but he looked very pale- a familiar kind of pale. I had a feeling in my gut he was diabetic, but when I asked he didn’t respond. Where I live, the fire department is literally across the street from the store. I stayed on the phone with dispatch for a while as she asked me questions, and finally hung up once she told me they were on the way. We wait another 3 minutes or so until they arrive. Once they get there they start asking questions, and one question they asked was if he was a diabetic, to which he said finally said yes. They check his sugar and it was at 21. Once they said that my jaw dropped and I froze. They got him up on the gurney and took him into the ambulance. Once my coworker and I went inside I immediately started crying uncontrollably and headed for the bathroom. I felt like I was looking at my future and it was terrifying. I tried to pull myself together but I had to leave work for the day because I was so distraught. I’ve never witnessed another diabetic so critically low before. They asked him if he gave himself insulin and he said yes, and then they asked if he ate anything and he said he didn’t know. It made me think about growing old and being in situations like this. I could have my diabetes under control but you can’t fight old age and it really scared me. My coworker texted me and told me the gentleman was okay, and that he drove home after about 30-45 minutes in the ambulance.

The whole T2 vs T1 debate,"I get it. I’m not a fan I share a name with a group of people most of who have given themselves this problem as a direct result of unhealthy choices. I have to stress first though that is not an invitation of disrespect to any T2. T2 is a problem I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. 

I know that comment alone will explode my inbox so I will just address it right now. Yep, the only argument you have is not all T2 had a choice. Very true. Sometimes T2 is just not reversible. Very very true. Sometimes it’s just genetic like T1. Also very very true. 

But before you take this as a logical discourse in defense that a T2 is just as much a victim of circumstance as us, please at least recognize the OVERWHELMING MAGNITUDE of just how anecdotal and trivial such points of argument are. It is such a statistically small subset of T2 it is mind boggling I hear it as often as I do as a defense for the larger population. 

Yes, not all T2 had a choice in the matter, to that end many T1s became so as a direct result of their poor choices too. Car accident results in pancreas amputation? Grats, you’re a T1 now. Should of worn a seat belt. Shame on you huh. 

Simply put, a defense that the 1% of T2 that are such as a result of things totally and understandably out of their own control is not somehow an argument for the other 99%! 

I mean come on. You eat a lot. You don’t exercise. There’s always consequences. Period. There’s no way around that. Don’t do a disservice to that 1% of T2 who are victims of circumstances. That is just as offensive as the drawing of an equivalence between us T1s and the overwhelming majority of T2. We simply are not the same. 

We can’t fix our problem. The MAJORITY of T2s can fix their problem.

In the end I DEEPLY respect the plight of all T2s whether it’s a result of your own choices or not. It is a miserable thing to have. We’re all fucking suffering. T1 and T2. But let’s PLEASE stop drawing these lines that we are some how equal in the nature and origins of that struggle. We are not.

"Need advice about insulin pumps, and feeling like a failure","I am feeling very upset and frustrated at the moment. Recently I started regularly seeing my diabetes specialist nurse (I’m in the UK) and really trying to tackle my fluctuating blood sugar levels. I am on Novorapid and Lantus insulin, and I started using the Freestyle Libre last month (which is fantastic). No matter what I do, I can not stop the post-meal spikes, and the awful dawn phenomenon (as soon as I wake up my blood sugar rises and the insulin doesn’t touch it until noon). 

The nurse confirmed that I am doing everything that I should be doing - carb counting, taking insulin earlier before eating, testing regularly. She has referred me to a doctor that will assess if I can get an insulin pump. I knew it was coming and I do think that this might be the best option for me, but the moment she said it I wanted to burst into tears because I feel like a failure.

I’ve been diabetic for 9 years and I just thought that I would have a good grasp on this by now. I know that people are able to live full lives using insulin pens and yet I can’t seem to figure it out. I know in my head that this is a silly way of thinking but I still feel down about it.

I was hoping that maybe somebody here might be able to ease my mind about possibly going on to a pump. Has being on a pump helped your control? Is it a hindrance to have this device stuck to you at all times? Does it stop you from moving freely or hurt if you move a certain way? Most importantly, is there anyone here who suffered with dawn phenomenon and found that the pump helped?

Listening to a NPR show on Medicine and tech.,"NPR  made several arguments that : increasing technology in medicine increases the disparity in class health and economic standing. This is paraphrased, of course.

I see what they are saying, but equity in healthcare seems like a questionable idea to me. For example, if we had put a hold on CGM and pump technologies, they wouldn't be as available or affordable (compared to when they were first introduced) as they are now.

I understand that some people cannot afford them even still, and we should and do work to help those people get access to those resources, but should we have held back those technologies because they are too expensive for a portion of people?

Should we hold back on developing new technologies in the future for similar reasons?

What do you think? Help me understand why this perspective would take hold enough in medicine and academia for NPR to do a story on it. (I am not certain what broadcast it was.

Pump broken,"In January of 2018, I switched to the omnipod, after using needles for a couple of years for personal reasons, and decided it was worthless to me after running through probably 400 units of wasted insulin inside pods that had fallen off, and decided to switch back to an older pump, however
   
Sometime in the summer of 2018 - late August or so, my pump, a Medtronic minimed paradigm fell onto concrete, and broke. It was an old pump, and out of warranty.    
   
soon after my pump broke, I started using a CGM, and it has changed my life. Not needing to check every meal has been a godsend, as I have not been the best in keeping that part under control.    
   
However, even with this added boost to my ability to control my diabetes, I haven’t been able to control it how I would like. All of these things have been happening in my transition into the college life, and I am finding myself having a harder and harder time controlling myself, as I tend to forget things like lantus, or forget an insulin shot.     
    
My question, I guess, is do any of you happen to have an old pump stored away somewhere that you would be willing to part with? Or have any advice as to how to go about getting a new one? My insurance is saying that they will not cover a new pump for 2 more years due to the omnipod.

Just want to vent about my hospital stay,"Just a piece of background info: Along with T1D I also have ankylosing spondylitis and am on Humira, an immunosuppressant for it which makes me more susceptible to infections, I’ve had about two a year since I started it.

So I changed my pump (omnipod) on Sunday/Monday and it was kind of irritated, not unusual, it was in for the whole three days when my doc has me prescribed for two because my body tends to reject them early. Few days later it’s more irritated and showing some signs of infection. Wednesday it was even worse so I went to urgent care. They said they were glad I came in when I did, lanced it to add a gauze to help drain it and got me an rx for antibiotics. 

The next day it was worse and I was dizzy and nauseas, went back to urgent care who then sent me to the ER because they were worried about sepsis at this point. I contacted my rheumatologist to clarify I should cease taking my immunosuppressant and ask how I should handle it. She got back to me with instructions, she has always allowed me to be a participant in my own care and has trusted my judgement when my care would also affect my diabetes.

At the hospital, all is good in the ER, no one concerned about my pump although I had to explain, the infusion site became infected after I removed it and that my pump was not still at the infection site. 

Once I was admitted I had to repeatedly clarify to the nurse what an insulin pump does vs a cgm. This continued the entire time. I also had to spell Ankylosing Spondylitis for her multiple times and clarify that just putting spondylosis as the diagnosis was not sufficient because AS is autoimmune and general spondylosis doesn’t automatically mean that. 

Luckily they let me keep my insulin pump and just keep a log (that nobody looked at because none of the nurses understood diabetes or insulin pumps) but, again, I had to clarify multiple times that no, my pump was not still at the infection site. I made it clear there was nothing wrong with my pump, my infusion sites, ect. And this was an issue because I am immunosuppressed. 

When I saw the doc he kind of questioned me more than necessary on my AS diagnosis because I’m a girl, more men are diagnosed with AS, and because my diagnosis wasn’t confirmed by radiology or gene testing. Kind of annoying, but I am used to my diabetes being the scapegoat of all my problems so I was just happy he was focusing on the disease that actually caused the issue and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just interested.

Yesterday, while waiting 7 hours to be discharged they sent in a diabetes educator, without informing me beforehand. She woke me up and started grilling me. She was trying to make this an issue about how I manage my insulin pump. She tried to insist there was some problem with how I use my pump to explain the infection, trying to suggest things like I need to use skin tac wipes, which I have had reactions to. She didn’t ask me what I thought happened or how I manage my pump. I have been on a pump for 12 years. I just felt blindsided, I just reaffirmed there were no issues with my pump and that it was my immunosuppressant and I’ve already been in contact with my rheum.

I will say I’m lucky that my endo is also type one so he has always understood and has always respected the fact that I am the expert on my own individual experience with diabetes.  It’s just annoying when you have people who know very little trying to lecture you because you’re in the hospital for a tangently related issue.


TL;DR Was in the hospital for an infection from my infusion site because I am immunosuppressed to treat my ankylosing spondylitis, nurses didn’t know the difference between a pump and a cgm and they surprised me with a diabetes educator trying to blame my pump management for the infection.",diabetes_t1,1556377086,Anarchyschild,5,11,True,2019-04-27

I feel like I can't handle all of this.
I have depression, anxiety, and I'm schizoafective.
The state I live in does a crap job with taking care of mental health, and the past ones did a horrid job with my diabetes to the point where I was either spiking up around the 500's and 600's, and the lows with the lowest one being around 20.
I haven't told my parents or past therapists about this, but I get flashbacks and I hate them.
They're too frequent and terrify me. I was in a relationship with a girl a few years back and I'll just sum it up as I guess I wasn't treated very well and she said I was too much to handle(I can't understand that part at least, especially at our ages that we were)
I'm kind of close to breaking down, but god I hate when this happens. I hate when this gets to me to the point where everything just comes flooding back and I've been having such a hard time putting my infusion sites in because of the fear of being in so much pain, physically and emotionally.
Home life wasn't and stil isn't very great.
Mother and father went through a ton of crappy and/or abusive exes, so I guess I kind of have a hard time accepting that because I'd love to say my family life and childhood is/was great.

I feel terrible, and generally like a burden at the moment.

"Billed for doctor visit AND ""analysis"" of CGM history","Wanted to see if anyone else has seen this billing practice... My husband has T1 and a Dexcom G5. Went to the endocrinologist to get his prescriptions renewed, no change in dosage. With our insurance plan we are supposed to pay a $25 copay for doctor visits. Just got a bill for the A1C test he got at the same visit (expected) AND a $90 charge for ""CGM Analysis"". During the appointment a nurse asked him to download a Dexcom app that lets you share your Dexcom data with the doctor whereas they used to download it from the receiver manually. So he installs this app, enters some share code, and the nurse prints out a chart of his glucose levels for the past x months. Doctor glances at it, asks if his carb/insulin ratio is still working for him, renews the prescriptions for the same dosages. Granted they talked about other things at the appointment, it was not a total waste, but what exactly is this charge??? I understand paying separately for tests but when you pay for a doctor visit you are paying for the doctor's time to look at your test results, make a diagnosis and prescribe things. Seems like they are charging us twice for the same thing.

Obviously I will be calling the doctor's office and asking them but I'd like to know if this is something other people have been billed for.

Went to the ER for DKA. Was gonna leave until the staffs ignorance put me back into DKA.,"So I'm in the hospital. I got thrown into DKA after fighting a nasty infection and not being able to eat for several days. I've been here for 2 and a half days now. I was supposed to go home this morning because I've been out of DKA for some time. I got unhooked from machines and was finally aloud to eat. So I ate. They gave me my slow acting. Only 1/4th of what I normally take because that was ""doctors orders"".

Then they gave me my fast acting to cover my blood sugar. At first they were going to give me 7 units at each meal no matter what my sugar was or how much I ate. I had to explain the sliding scale and why its important. They talked to the doctor then gave .e the right dose for my blood sugar. So I was like ok, but what about my food? You guys told me I had to eat all of this and it's like 90 grams of carbs that was on this plate....

The nurse was like you got your sliding scale.. I then had to explain that was for my blood sugar alone. I still need to cover carbs. They weren't hearing it. So a few hours pass and they drop a large carby meal in front of me. I ask them to check my blood sugar and give me my fast acting. (I shouldn't be having to ask!) 
So they check my blood sugar and its 478! The nurse gets nasty with me and asks me what I ate to make it that high. I said a meal that was supposed to be covered with insulin...

They kept insisting they covered it with ""sliding scale"". Again I'm having to explain I need coverage for carbs also. They're talking to me like I did something wrong and was sneaking candy.
I was ready to go home but, now I'm back in DKA.
I'm hooked back up to all those machines again.

I just want to cry.

Recouping defective/failed Dexcom CGM equipment?,"Hi all. I've had some weird ocurences the last few days and I'm wondering if anyone's experienced anything similar and/or know if anything can be recouped, either from Dexcom or my supplier (Fifty50 Pharmacy).

Trying to be concise: I have a Dexcom G5 I've been using a while with no issues. Monday I get an alert about the transmitter having a low battery. It says it should be replaced within three weeks. The transmitter was activated Jan. 21, so it's definitely falling short of the six month purported battery life. At the time, I figure I'll call Dexcom and/or Fifty50 sometime in the next week or so and see what they say.

Then Wednesday I wake up and see the receiver, my phone, has lost signal. Normally I restart my sensors 2-3 times, until they continuously lose signal or become inaccurate, but at this point the sensor had been restarted only once. I thought maybe I'd been sleeping on it, and it would begin working after I got up, but hours later, it hadn't. I shrug and restart the sensor a second time. 

The sensor works for a few minutes, then loses signal again. I figure it must be the transmitter battery (despite the transmitter being only ~three months old, and despite the earlier error indicating I had three weeks left) and replace the transmitter. 

I start the new transmitter, stop and restart the sensor, and enter two calibrations. It works for a few minutes, then loses signal again. I figure this particular sensor is dying earlier than normal, after being restarted, and replace it.

After calibrating things ""work,"" but the numbers are way off, which is really unusual. Normally I eat keto so my BG is usually a nearly flat line. After calibrating however the CGM was showing I was at ~170mg/dL and continuing to trend upward. I hadn't eaten so this seemed weird. I check my BG via fingersticks and see it's ~100mg/dL. I enter this calibration, trying to ""fix"" the inaccurate readings, but they instead began trending downward. Eventually the meter began giving me repeated ""urgent"" low BG alerts, despite my BG still being at ~100mg/dL. I figure I must have gotten a bad sensor somehow and replaced it again.

I start the new sensor and calibrate. Things work for a few minutes, then again, lost signal. I'm really dumbfounded at this point. Up until all of this, the only time I'd see a lost signal was after multiple sensor restarts. I restart the sensor again, because I really don't know what else to do, and *finally* things are working now (knock on wood).

So, not having insurance, this all costs quite a bit. Anyone know if Dexcom or Fifty50 would be willing to send replacements for anything? I assume I should omit the fact I normally restart the sensors, but anything else I should do or say?

Haven’t been able to get my blood sugar under 200 all week,"So for some context, I usually have really good control. My A1C was 5.9 last time I got it checked. I’m eating a ton of food to try and gain muscle, I’m extremely active, I was eating 3,500 calories a day and not gaining any weight. So I bumped it up to 3,700-4,000 depending on my activity level. In the morning, my blood sugar spikes to 250+ immediately after I eat, in the evening for my “lunch” it spikes 2-3 hours after I eat and then I workout with insulin on board to get it down. Then 2-3 hours after dinner in the middle of the night it spikes again anywhere from 200-250+, so I cover for it and end up about 190 5 hours later... it’s extremely frustrating because I thought I had it under control.. I have even adjusted my insulin to carb ratio from 1:15 to 1:12 in the mornings, and from 1:12 to 1:10 in the evening and at night. Could it be because I upped my calorie intake? I haven’t checked the date on my insulin but I’m pretty sure it’s not expired because I just bought it a couple weeks ago.. could it be the weather change? It’s really hot where I live. I really don’t know and I’m super frustrated, I can’t work or workout or socialize because I’m so stressed about it.. share your experiences, give me advice, or even just comfort.

Post lunch spikes,"I've been type 1 for about 9 years, and have maintained pretty solid a1cs (in the low 6s) for most of that time with the help of dexcom and a pump. In the past month or so however, I seem to be unable to avoid serious post lunch spikes when I eat anything that has a decent amount of carbs (like a sandwich). I've tried pre-bolusing and increasing my dose, and temp basal rates, as well as going for brief 10 min brisk walks. The walks help temporarily, but the effect doesn't last.  Once the dexcom line turns upward, it doesn't seem to matter how much insulin I throw at it, u end up near 250 and can't come down until 5 or so hours later.

I have really bad anxiety with doctors because of some pre-diagnosis stuff I went through as a kid, so I HATE doctors appointments.

Insulin pumps,"Non diabetic here, plenty of friends and family with type 1.

My A1c is finally at 7% after 5 years of being between 10-13%,"I know it’s not the best a1c but I really couldn’t be any happier. I’ve been depressed since my teen years, and with that came an apathy about taking care of myself. Why bother with maintaining good blood sugars when you don’t care about living anyway? After cycling in and out of diabulimia and self loathing, I finally have a modicum of control over my disease and it feels *amazing*. My body feels better, my moods are my stable. My vision doesn’t sporadically blur. I’m just so damn happy about it all. 

For those of you who are curious about the process for me in helping control my diabetes, I changed the following:
1. An endocrinologist who listens to me. She’s a fellow, I straight up told her I hate white old men. They have never listened to anything I say and what my struggles are. So I no longer have to see the attending for longer than 5 seconds. They come in, say hello, and leave. Bless my endo. 

2. New pump system and CGM (i use the 670g but usually no auto mode). Sometimes I double up and use the freestyle libre too. 

3. A super supportive boyfriend who’s concerned about my health. My SOs in the past never expressed any interest in helping me manage either my mental health or my diabetes. He’s amazing. He does both. 

4. Address the mental health first. I went to therapy for a long time, went on anxiety meds. I had to fix my mindset before I could try fixing my idiotic pancreas.

Help with fluctuating blood sugars!,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with diabetes aged 9 (am now 18) and overall I’ve been able to handle it moderately well. Usually around 6 HBA1C.

What kind of range of food can i expect to have with this kind of restriction?

Will i feel crappy for a while after i make the change?

I take the Lantus before I sleep in order to align the small peak in activity when when I wake up to offset the morning rise (althought I still need to take almost twice as much bolus with breakfast as I would for same carbs at dinner time, damn dawn phenomenon).

I'd had this before but never noticed any effect so has concluded that Lantus doesn't suffer from the same sort of freak quick action that Humalog with sometimes give me.

Had an eerily low BG reading today,"It was related to exercise, which I thought I had gotten the hang on but apparently not. I read 1.8 mmol/L (32 mg/dL). The scariest part was that even though I've been a diabetic for only a few months, my only symptom was that my heart started racing and I felt a bit shaky, which prompted me to check immediately. I would've hoped I would have gotten symptoms a lot earlier, but I don't feel anything except a bit of hunger until I'm below 3 mmol/L. My endocrine nurses don't really believe me because they say hypoglycemic unawareness is very uncommon except in new diabetics, as it will usually only happen if you've already been low a lot of times. 

Problem is, I am pretty sure I had fasting hypoglycemia prior to diabetes, and since I often skipped breakfast and ate lunch late, I had very frequent lows back then. That is, I believe it was hypoglycemia because my heart started raising and I felt shaky, and the symptoms went away after eating sugar, but I never actually had my BG tested during one of those episodes as I did not at the time realise it was abnormal. I couldn't feel hunger and didn't really know what it felt like, so I thought the shakiness and heart-racing (even sharp chest pains sometimes) was just what hunger felt like, since it went away after I ate. Anyway I wonder if this frequent hypoglycemia might have caused me to be much less aware of hypoglycemia than would be expected.

Dead Medtronic Insulin Pump,"I will make this story short and to the point as I believe everyone should know that Medtronic has failed to fix their own equipment failure.

Today, Saturday at 9am, my 8 month old 670G insulin pump started beeping with a error message on the screen.  I called the support line and explained the issue.  Medtronic said that the pump will not continue working and is unusable. The earliest they can get a new pump to me is possibly by Monday.

Back when I first started using insulin and the Minimed 530 in 2005, Medtronic guaranteed that they could get me a new replacement pump within 24 hours if not sooner.  I had my first pump fail in 2008 and they got me a new pump that night.

I called Tandem diabetes and will be switching over to the t:slim pump as they can replace a broken pump by shipping over air mail and having a private delivery company deliver it that day or as soon as possible.

Then to top it off, Spike isn't working (as many know.....) so I can't extend them at the moment...then Dexcom told me I was using it wrong and they can't replace it without a letter from my insurance because I screwed up and mentioned I was inserting it on my arm (""that's illegal!"")

This shit never happened to me before,"At first sorry for my english. I am from Austria and I do my best. I am also on my phone so sorry about the formatting.

A few things about me: I am 19 years old and I suffer from diabetes t1 for 15 years. I have a pump since I was 10 I guess. At fist I had a medtronic pump but I  got a ypsomed pump last year bc it's not that big and you can connect it to your phone and other benefits. I use a steel catheter since the plastic ones always bend (???) hence I always had a leaking catheter and my bloodsugar was high. But the steel ones are great, I don't feel them in my body and my blood sugar is great since then.

Now about the little fuck up. Last Friday I was in Vienna and got really hungry so I ordered fast food and ate it. Me being a dumb, lazy idiot, I forgot to inject the insulin. So after an hour I felt that my blood sugar was high and I corrected my mistake. After half an hour I felt it was still pretty high (don't worry I also checked my blood sugar level) and I injected another dosis of insulin. But nothing changed. I thought it was normal since I ate a lot and normally my body needs to ""calm down"" after being on a high glucose level. Later me and my gf decided to go and get some food so I drove to the mall and bevor I went into the restaurant I checked my blood sugar which is still high af. I know I should have considered it before but now was the time I had to change the catheter. I was angry bc I rarely need that long to get a decent glucose level. I put a new catheter in  and removed the old one.
I almost got a heart attack bc the plastic on the catheter was fine but the 9 mm needle wasn't attached to the plastic anymore. I pressed on the part of my body where the catheter originally was and I felt an unpleasant pain. I still had no panic since my gf was next to me but if she wasn't here I would have screamed and cried bc I was so scared. So I drove to the hospital and they tried to pull this 9 mm thing out of my body. They cut a piece of my skin out, searched for it and finally after 20 minutes they managed to show me the needle.

Now I am sitting here, one week later with a healing scar and praying that I never ever have to experience this shit  again. I guess it was a production problem but it still scares me to think about that this could happen again.

Not eating to bring down blood sugar-- newly diagnosed with limited information from doctor,"Hello. One of my friends (30 years old) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes two days ago and is *extremely* overwhelmed. I asked her if I could try to find some answers to some of her questions, so she knows I'm looking into this for her. Long story short: after being diagnosed 2 days ago and being sent home with limited information, she thinks that not eating for 10+ hours is necessary to bring down her sugar levels. Is that correct? She has other questions, but that's the one at the top of her mind.

 She has an appointment with a dietician next week, but during the diagnosis appointment a couple days ago, her endocrinologist basically just gave her a meter, some insulin, a chart for how much to administer based on blood sugar levels, and a pamphlet. My friend also came away with the impression that she shouldn't eat if her blood sugar is high. With her sugar over 200, she went over 10 hours without eating, and the number did not dip at all. She finally broke down and ate a small salad, after which her blood sugar went even higher. She's absolutely panicked now but acknowledges that ""never eat again"" is probably not the answer. Her doctor's  office hasn't been returning messages, so here I am on reddit for her (she's going to get a new endocrinologist after she gets the immediate situation under control). Here are the questions she asked me to look into:

* Should she be skipping meals and snacks to that extent? Or should she just go ahead and eat her regular meals while sticking to low-carb foods, even if that will raise her blood sugar?
* As a new Type 1 diabetic, should she be focused on eating low carbs AND low cholesterol? That's what Google keeps telling her. If she doesn't cut cholesterol right away, is that a huge problem? She's just now trying to wrap her head around cutting carbs to get her sugar down. She is normal, if not under-weight, if that matters.
* And this one breaks my heart... if she goes to sleep with her blood sugar over 200, could she die in her sleep? She has been giving herself insulin based on the chart, but she hasn't been able to get her sugar below 200 so far, and she was terrified to go to sleep last night. Does high blood sugar like that just happen sometimes? Like you try your best to get the number down but it just doesn't happen right away? In the scheme of things, is temporarily having numbers in the 200-225 range an immediate threat if you're sleeping? 
* Does anyone have any tips or ""hacks""-- not like ""short cuts"" since this doesn't seem like the kind of thing where there are any, but more like ""things you wish your doctors and the books had told you at the beginning.""

"T1D, exercising in the AM, and ketones","Hi! First-time posting in here and I'm really looking for some guidance from other Type 1 Diabetics when it comes to trying to lose weight and exercising then falling into ketoacidosis. I'm 21 years old, have been a T1D for almost 13 years, weight about 160 lbs, and am 5'8"". I grew up as a swimmer and water polo player so I have a muscular build, but I'd like to lose about 10 lbs of fat.

My fitness journey started in February 2018 and although I've lost about 15 lbs, I seem to have hit a plateau. Here's what I've been doing in an effort to lose weight: carefully count my macros, use an insulin pump to correct for meals/high BG, gradually reduced my Humalog intaken as my insulin sensitivity has increased, eat a low carb and high fat+protein diet, and exercise 4-5 times per week (used to do Corepower yoga nearly every day, started Orange Theory about a month ago). Any tips or suggestions to help me lose fat?

One of my biggest issues as a T1D is when I exercise in the AM. Before an AM workout, I make sure that my BG is at its target range. But right after the workout (it can be ANYTHING from cardio, HIIT, Pilates, to weight training, yoga, running, spin, etc.), my BG skyrockets up to 400-500 and I sometimes test positive for ketones. Afterward, I have to take a ton of insulin to feel better. It’s so frustrating because I workout to lose weight and feel good, but it does the opposite. Does taking the insulin afterward erase all of my progress from the workout because it’s a fat retaining hormone? Working out in the evening isn't as bad (though my BG does sometimes range between 200-300 post workout), and I'm not sure if it's because I've eaten fats, berries, and veggies throughout the day.  Does anyone else experience this issue or have advice? I'd just like to figure it out so I can feel good after I exercise and reach my fitness goals.

Thank you guys in advance!!",diabetes_t1,1555544848,mlecollins,7,2,True,2019-04-17

Issues with matting injection sites.,"Hello, I've had type 1 diabetes since I was about 12, now currently 18 and I've had issues with controlling it my entire life. My issue at the moment is I don't think I am a large enough person for the doses of insulin I am taking. I am fairly small at 130lb and 5'9 so my injection sites aren't very large to begin with. I use my arms, stomach and thighs right and left side, with a preference for my arms due to convenience. I typically inject 50-70 units a day ( long acting and short acting).

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that my injection sites tend to mat up and become nearly unusable quite quickly, even when rotating my sites. So this typically creates a cycle of about one or two weeks of my sugars being fine and under control, into about a week or two of them being constantly high because all of my insulin is building up rather than getting absorbed and then finishing off with about a week of sitting quite low due to all of the excess dumping into my system. That three week period is interfering with my life quite heavily and schooling because I find it impossible to try and sit in a classroom setting while zoning out or falling asleep due to fluctuating sugars. My grades are good and I get the work done at home, But it's very hard to explain to a non diabetic what that experience is like. I've also tried getting help from my local diabetic education center but their response is essentially a different format of ""Well keep trying"" or ""do it better"" every time.

Game changer for the (very) active type 1,"It was suggested of me to cross post this here. I originally posted it in the bjj forum since I'm a grappler and type 1 since the age of 6 years old, and I'm currently turning 38 this weekend. Going to pasta my post now -

In threads in the past I have had conversations with members about CGMs and how the pump, etc was not an option for me as I cant keep a sensor or port in to save my life. They always pulled out, no matter how well I wrapped and taped them to my body, so I gave up and did it the old fashioned way. Finger sticks and shots. 

Last week I got the Eversense CGM implant and it is the real deal. They implant a sensor, in the form of a capsule/chip under the skin and then place the transmittor on the skin which sends the readings to an app on my phone. Best part is that I can slap a new adhesive on after training everyday and it wont break the bank the way a traditional CGM would as insurance only covers one sensor per week. They give 100 adhesive patches per 3 month period and buying more patches isnt very costly at all.

 

This is seriously one of the best things to happen for active diabetics, especially those of us who grapple. I have been training for many years, and this has been a godsend for me. When I train, I take the transmitter off, when I'm done training, I put it right back on. Easy as that for a cgm. I don't have to worry about covering anything when training or fear people grabbing it when they grab my gi etc

I know Im leaving some detailed shit out but go research it and see if your insurance will cover it.

The insurance plan I have through my wife covers the sensor, however I am in a different state at the time so my the had to contract with a local BCBS plan that unfortunately, doesnt cover the system. Luckily the Eversense has a bridge program that cuts the costs down TREMENDOUSLY to only about $99 for a three month insertion, and you get three insertions for a total of $300 for 9 months of CGM. During that time they can try to help you get it covered and theyll work your insurance I believe.

A plus is that one of the reps has trained BJJ, so they understand what its like to deal with this shit. Customer service has been great with them and they are calling to check up on me daily to answer any questions or to see if Im having any issues. 

 Im not getting paid, nor do I work for or affiliate with the company, but as I said this is a big deal for me and my care. Hopefully it can help someone else out who is in the same place I have been in for the past 12+ years when it comes to bjj and grappling.

Ive been type 1 since I was about 6 years old, I normally test between 6-12x per day, and today I only poked my fingers 2x for the daily calibration.

Maintaining physically active life - Father with late onset T1,"Hi All!  


My father was recently diagnosed with T1 in his late 50s.  His whole life, he was a high level baseball player (20s) who turned towards endurance sports (marathons) in his later years.  


In his late 50s, he was diagnosed with T1.  Because of this, he is struggling and is still in the experimental phase regarding how to maintain his strength training and running routine.  Recently, he has done quite well in building/maintaining muscle mass through weight training.  However, he is struggling during his runs and is unable to even make it a mile or two before needing to slow down or stop.

My tandem rep has essentially stopped responding to me when I asked about scheduling training. Training through my endo would be a month or more out. 

I have been working hard to get this daily life improvement ready and came to terms with wanting/needing a pump to get even better control. 

Do I really need the training? The pump comes Monday. I really don’t want to wait.

I think I had my first good endo visit in 21 years today.,"27 now, T1 diagnosed at 6. I was a very sensitive kid, not in a cry at Hallmark commercials way, more in a crusader for justice, pathologically empathetic sort of way. Parents just did not know how to deal with my diagnosis, Mom couldn’t handle it emotionally, Dad withdrew. Looking back, I think I may have developed some kind of mild version of PTSD because of the crying, screaming and yelling that went on at home, then going to the endo as a kid and my mother having hysterics, everyone telling me I was bad for having these blood sugars, drama egged on by doctors. Ages 7-20 I just felt so alone. Wasn’t able to ever really deal with things the way I needed to deal with them because of the shitstorm it would set off at home, so my only way out was to just ignore it. Cue about 18 years of A1c’s anywhere from 9-12%. Panic attacks lasting hours before and after every endo appointment. Anger at feeling like my doctors were holding me hostage, anger at my mother for making me so emotionally labile about this life-threatening condition which I would have to deal with everyday for the rest of my life, while she could walk away at any time after an emotional outburst “whew! I feel a little better!” 
I worked through a lot of this shit on my own- exploring why this was happening, how I could ever forgive my parents, talking through the tears to a very few select people that I trusted. It took about 7 years to get me from pretty bad depression and anxiety to somewhere that I want to reach out and help others. 
I’m ok now. I still have anxiety when I see my doctor, but it’s better every time. I’m working hard to fight my inertia about taking insulin before meals instead of after, to calibrate my Dexcom when it needs it, and look at my patterns and see what I can do to improve. I’m not a miracle, my A1c is still running in the 8% range, but I have goals and more importantly, I have support. 
This journey we’re on literally won’t be over until we’re dead. But that’s okay guys. It can get better. The trauma, anger, depression, anxiety, fear, shame that we have almost all felt at some point can be the seed of empowerment. We are all special, dealing with a disease that is fucking hard to deal with on every level- psychologically, mentally, physically, and spiritually. We have fucked up days, weeks (years!— decades!!) but in the end, we are all learning something incredibly important about struggle and perseverance and the maximum of what we can endure before breaking.
I hope that today you are in range, your schedule for the day is in no way affected by lows or highs, you feel great, your pump site stays on, your CGM doesn’t error, the bruises from your injections are fading, your doctor says, “You’re doing fine. I’m not worried about you.” And you sleep through the night without any buzzing, beeping, or waking up drenched in sweat. 
Thanks friends.

Interested in Understanding Diabetes!,"Hi there - I'm working on a project in which I'm trying to learn how children with T1 diabetes learn about diabetes and manage their daily lives in a way that they're not bothered by their diabetes. I have a few questions that I'd love for people in this community to help answer.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do people with Diabetes ultimately get diagnosed and learn the steps involved in managing their T1 Diabetes? I assume this diagnoses usually happens in childhood -- how do parents realize their child is suffering and react?
2. How does the newly diagnosed person begin incorporating their new habits into their lifestyle? What are some habits they must include in their lives that they didn't need to do beforehand? How do kids learn what to do?
3. How do newly diagnosed people track their efforts and how do they react to taking insulin, measuring insulin, and leading hyper-healthy lives?
4. What motivates people to stay on track and continue living in a healthy way? Are there any tools or motivating factors that keep people on track?
5. Is there any technology that helps onboard you to the disorder and manage your rituals and outcomes?

Honeymoon period success with LCHF diet,"Just wanted to share a recent update. Diagnosed in March last year with LADA, at age 35. By May had switched over to a strict low-carb high-fat diet (lazy ketogenic - under 30g net carbs/day but not adhering to strict dietary macros) - against the advice of the nutritionists and my first endocrinologist - as I found this was leading to excellent blood sugar control and minimized insulin needs. Still in my honeymoon period, so my pancreas ain't dead yet, and kept having to revise down my insulin dosage over those first two months to avoid hypos. Since adopting the LCHF diet I've settled at a level of *two* units of Toujeo daily, with *zero* short-acting insulin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully found a new endo six months ago who is supportive of my choices, and had my third checkup this week. A1C of **5.2%**, all measures of cholesterol excellent, also great readings for liver, kidneys, sodium etc. Most importantly, I feel great. If you'll allow me a momentary happy dance - I'm pretty proud of me. My stable blood sugars and limited exogenous insulin make exercise non-stressful. I take days off from my Libre CGM and have no worries, and I almost never have to prick my finger because I haven't had an actual low in 6/7 months, and that was after drinking one too many whiskys and lasted about 10 minutes.  


This post is basically intended to:

1. Encourage those of you struggling to control your blood sugars to give it a try (particularly those of you in the honeymoon period, because I can speak directly to that). Maybe it might not work for you and it does require some sacrifices, but if you do it right it is massively empowering. You're taking control of this disorder, rather than fighting it.
2. Point out something that I haven't seen spoken about much here, which is that reducing stress on your beta cells can help prolong the honeymoon period. If you are in the same boat as me with LADA, a LCHF diet could prolong function.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're hesitant and have concerns I may be able to speak to them, but - again - I would strongly recommend the diet on multiple levels!",diabetes_t1,1555103111,PhotoshopHandsome,51,7,True,2019-04-12
Big Backpacking Trip Plans,"Hi all, I (F) am planning a 20-mile/overnight hiking trip in early fall with family members. I’m lucky bc two members are nurses and one is an EMT. That is besides the point. I have a t:slim pump w/DexCom G6 and an iPhone. I utilize the Clarity app and am working on logging things in OneDrop so I can adjust patterns.

Questions:
1. If you use an iPhone, what tools/apps do you use for logging?
2. If you have gone backpacking, what advise do you have for keeping blood sugar steady? 
I’m thinking of detaching/running Basal really low and eating minimum carbs so I don’t have too much IOB.
3. What do you recommend packing? 

The weather will be moderate and there will be significant elevation gain. I worry about CGM/meter readings, so I may want to take into account reading deviation percentages at various altitudes.

Error/Glitch with FreeStyle libre,"Hi everyone!

I am writing this on behalf of my mom who has been a type 1 diabetic for 40 years. She just recently got the freestyle libre two days ago and it’s been working amazingly. 

However, tonight she went to check her sugars, and the libre screen had the message “connected to computer”, despite the reader being on the counter not connected to anything. 

We can’t seem to make the message go away (and it won’t let her check her sugars with the message on the screen), nor does plugging it in to charge help. 

I tried googling but I couldn’t find anything to help with this issue - has anyone experienced this before or have any idea how to fix it? Luckily she still has strips for her old meter so she can still check her sugars but it isn’t ideal as her fingers barely bleed anymore.

Held Hostage,"Am I alone in feeling like I am being held hostage by the doctors? I don’t need to see a doctor. Nothing is wrong. Nothing has changed.

If it was a random person on the street threatening to choke me to death and deny me the air I need to breathe in exchange for money I would be screaming for police and justice. But it’s a doctor and this is a medical condition so it must be ok for them to do this right?

But I don’t want a doctor controlling my life for the rest of my life. I don’t want doctors telling me to get more exercise, drink more water, control my stress levels, get more sleep, and otherwise just be god damn well perfect all the fucking time. Test more.

I'm in med school so i did know a little bit about T1D before meeting her, but since we've been together i have dedicated a lot of my time to learn about diabetes so i can help her fight it, to the point where i can consider myself part of this community.

That being said, i am kind of in a desperate situation right now and i would like to see if you guys have any sugestions on anything that i could do to change this.

My girlfriend puts little to no effort in fighting her diabetes, she has an insulin pump (medtronic minimed), and uses the standart ""finger picking"" as Glucose measuring. (We are brazilians so we still can't have access to the most modern insulin pumps, also thats why my english is kinda broken).

She sometimes spends entire days without measuring her blood glucose. It usually stays around 200-400 and she refuses to be more carefull. She refuses to eat a healthy diet and constantly says things like ""i can't take this anymore, i dont want to live like this anymore, i sometimes wish i could just die"".

Earlier today she vomited because her sugar was high, it's almost every single month, she gets to her daily routine without her blood glucose measuring devices.

"Hey Medtronic, my body weight is none of your business","I'm calling because the flimsy, stupid O ring on the pump you manufactured is broken, again. And, while it's none of your business either and a bit condescending that you ask, I vaguely understand the logic behind asking my blood sugar, because some diabetics aren't as aware as I am and may need a reminder to adjust something or see a doctor after having an equipment malfunction.

However, there is absolutely no reason to ask my my goddamn weight. That's none of your business and it has no bearing whatsoever on any of the issues I'm having with your device.

Big evening meals...,"So I just did my third top up of insulin six hours after eating my evening meal. Every now and then I will pig out way too much in the evening and my BS will just refuse to stabilize for a *long* time afterwards. Today it was a bunch of tortilla chips with beef in a sweet sauce and some chocolate. Did a huge dose of insulin with the meal as I knew I needed a lot and it was fine for a bit. Hovered around 10 the following two hours so not ideal but I at least it didn't rise. As I knew I would need a top up I did some extra about 30 mins before the initial two hours were up. Turned out that wasn't enough because it still rose about 90 mins later so I did another top up and went for a walk on the treadmill as that does was peaking. This did the trick for about 30 mins until it started going up again and this brings me to now.

So frustrating because you tell yourself you can eat what you like as long as you do the insulin which is true to an extent but realisitically there are particular foods and quantities which are just way too hard to manage.

My control is generally decent and I keep fit. In fact all the moving around during the day is what I attribute my extreme hunger in the evenings to. I was dieting with one meal a day for a while. Figured it would be easier to control urges all day (was never a breakfast person) and just have all my calories in the evening. Problem was, today's situation ended up happening all the time so I'd started up breakfast again but it doesn't seem to help as my ravenous evening hunger still shows up from time to time.

Obviously 'be more disciplined' is probably the best advice. Maybe having lunch would help too but I like having long periods not worrying about having insulin on board as it makes unplanned physical activity really difficult.

So has anyone else had experience with this issue and have any tips or advice?",diabetes_t1,1554941734,YossaRedMage,9,6,True,2019-04-10

It seems like the last 5-6 sensors that we have used on our daughter haven't been able to make it the full 10 days. The majority of which are failing in the 5-8 day range. Not having the sensor function in conjunction with her t:slim is beyond frustrating due to her age (she's 3). Lately, it seems to be occurring more frequently.

Awareness about insulin costs and lack of accessibility (!!!),"I don't know when it started or what really brought the issue into the limelight, but I'm sure many of you have noticed that insulin prices and lack of accessibility has become a ""hot topic"" recently. Almost everyday when I'm browsing r/all, I'll come across a reference, article or meme about insulin prices, and it makes me so happy every time! It's finally become mainstream! This is a huge step toward lower prices, better insurance and increased awareness about the what it's like to be insulin dependant. Admittedly, the articles are generally sad, people dying because they couldn't afford insulin or someone didnt know how to treat a low. But these stories are being heard and people are being educated and that is amazing news for our community! 

No matter what situation you're in, if your insulin is free or you're rationing to be able go afford it, things are getting better! We have each other, and the internet/world's got our back. Soon, we'll be able to reminisce about the dark days when insulin had a price tag and people couldn't afford it. 

While we all got super lucky to benefit from this social outrage against insulin prices, lets not forget that were not the only one's suffering from autoimmune diseases and many don't have the support that we've been receiving recently.

Fed up with the 670g,"After a night of calibration needed shortly after calibrating and going to bed I wake up with a BS of 263. I calibrate and go into auto mode and give the correction. After consuming my 10 carb breakfast of coffee and creamer I am actually now at 290 with active insulin of 3.9 units. 

Go to give another correction since my sensitivity is set at 20. Quick maths will show (290-120)/20= 8.5 minus the 3.9 for active insulin so 4.6 units needed to get out of this high. Except the 670 says no correction needed. 

Some googling shows that the 670g will give much smaller corrections causing extended highs. I’ve kinda noticed this in the past when I have had to manually correct by giving carb boluses but I have never done the math just assumed it was the automode not quite functioning great to bring down highs. 

So my next two calls were to Medtronic to cancel my auto renew and to dexcom to check when I can get a g6. I’m tired of the hassle of the 670g for it to be too conservative and keep me at high blood sugar levels. I think I can do better with my low carb diet and a dexcom.

Best pump to get?,"Hey,

I'm sure this question has been asked many times before, and I'm sure the answer will be ""it's up to you and your needs"" but I don't really know what each has to offer (my endo went over it briefly) and I would like recommendations from people who actually used them since I would really like to get one. 


I've been diagnosed since Oct 31 18' (Spending my halloween in the hospital, ironically) and I've been using NPH, Humalog and Levemir. My numbers have been OK at best. According to Dexcom CLARITY (I have a G6) my GMI (assuming that is a1c?) is 8.6% and for the past 30 days I've been in range (75-200) 27% of the time (oh boy). I feel like having a pump would help me out with my numbers and I'm only 16 so I don't really want to fuck my body up now. 


So I have 3 options: Medtronic, T-Slim, and Omnipod. My mom is urging me to get the Omnipod since no tubing is required and it seems like the best option for that. I hate having things attached to me, and I'm not sure if I would like the idea of having tubes running into me at all times. I feel like I would dislike that and the Omnipod (to me) sounds like a plausible solution for this?


My endo said something about the Omnipod not having as many features as the other (medtronic I think) she said that one had something like an auto mode? I don't really know what that means but I'm just wondering what that does? I'm assuming all of the pumps can pair up with my Dexcom and adjust accordingly, or is this not how it works?

I feel like such an ass for neglecting tech/ignoring tech for a night that other people can’t dream of accessing. It it was either this or Dex would’ve been unceremoniously defenestrated (kidding).

Minimed 670g vs t:slim x2 cage match,"I am one of the unfortunate Cellnovo users being forced to switch pumps due to their failure. 

The two options I've been given to switch to without cost are the Minimed 670g and the t:slim x2. 

I was a long time Omnipod user and switched to the Cell-novo because the Omnipod isn't available in Australia and I really like the cordless/tubeless nature of the patch pumps. I have a Dexcom G5 which I read using my iPhone and I am on a low carb (20-30g per day other than carbs I take while running long distances). 

Good A1C and good control generally. 

My third option is going back to pens: Lantus and Novorapid. 

Any advice from users who have the t:slim x2 or Minimed 670g I'd love to hear as I'm inclined to just go back to pens and MDI unless there is setting truly superior about your experience with either or both.

I know that i'm supposed to take 1 unit of Novolog for roughly every 15 grams of carbohydrates. I've been carb counting correctly and still been getting weird results when I test my blood after meals. I think it's because of the fat content of the foods I've been eating.

What I’ve learned,"So maybe this will be unpopular, but I think I’ve learned a lot from being type 1. I think I take life for granted a lot less than I used to, so I think that’s an upside. I think we are forced to look at the pros when were on this side of things. I think most people take life for granted but we see it differently, and this can include anyone with a chronic illness, I’m not trying to single us out. In my experience, I have a much more positive attitude than my able bodied counterparts. When you’re faced with the worst, you seek positivity right? So in a way I feel blessed (I also hate the term blessed) to be here surviving despite it all. I’m also lucky to have a good job with decent insurance so maybe that helps. But barring all negative aspects of this disease - we are defying the odds just being here. And that, in itself, is amazing. 100 years ago we’d all be dead or starving to prolong our lives.

Are Humalog kwikpens accurate?,"I've recently switched from novorapid to humalog because it's cheaper.  


Immediately I wasn't a fan of the non-clicking action when pressing the ""plunger"".  
The novorapid pen would click each unit as you inject, but the humalog pen just silently goes down. (until reaching a spongy finish, instead of the hard stop at the end of a novorapid injection)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that concerns me though is that, after i dial my dose, and then start the injection, it often feels like the plunger slips on the first few units.

Frustration Friday with Dexcom and Costo and Insurance,"So this is going to be a bit of a rant, but I've been so frustrated with insurance lately. After spending 6+ hours arguing with CVS, Sanofi, and my insurance to get the proper amount of insulin I've kind of had enough with insurance.

I needed new sensors and transmitters for my G6. I was bopping around the internet when I found that someone had gone to Costco and paid around $30 per transmitter, which was way cheaper than what I paid through Dexcom. All you had to do was be a Costco member and get a prescription sent there. Boom I am sold. 

Costco fulfills and I go to pickup, total is $280 for one transmitter. I tell them that something is wrong, they say insurance denied my claim saying it was not covered. Call insurance, on the phone for 30 minutes can't understand a word she is saying, she's not clear on what information she needs. Lady tries some things, but still not going through, finally tells me I need to call BCBS to see the coverage. I let out a ""Are you f****ing serious,"" not at her but just at the world ya know. Lady asks me to ""not use bad words"" with her. I am fed up at this point and tell the lady I'll use whatever words I want and hang up. I know kind of mean, but sometimes you get frustrated.

I ask Costco to charge through their CMPP thing instead of insurance, because maybe that's what I am doing wrong. They try and now rings up to $140 per transmitter. They look confused and say they just rang someone up last week and it was around $30, which is the price I was expecting. Turns out, the master overlord Dexcom has changed the rebate it was giving Costco so now the transmitters are $140 instead of $30....

Sometimes I just wanna bang my head against the wall and punch things. All I was trying to do was save some dolla dolla bills yall. Dexcom has to go and do me dirty like that. Such dissapoint. Such mad. Such sadness. Such hate towards the world. I just wanna live.

TLDR; tried to get G6 trans through Costco for cheaper, argued with insurance for a while after spending 6+ hours last week arguing about insulin, got told Dexcom changed Costco rebate the week before I went so instead of $30/trans it's $140/trans.",diabetes_t1,1554473120,TheCST_CurryPot,11,10,True,2019-04-05

Suggestion for attaching Omnipods,"I've been having problems with Omnipod for several months. It's so bad that I'm trying to switch to T:Slim.

But I have been able to improve things and I want to explain how I do it just in case it helps some one else.

First and foremost, use an area that has lots of fat.

Second, look for veins. They appear blue/green and you must keep the infusion catheter from hitting them.

Third, rotate your locations as much as possible. For me there are only two places I can wear a pod successfully: my left and right abdominal fat roll. Anywhere else ends in tears / high blood sugar.

Do not overfill the Omnipod. No more than 200 Units, even though it can take a bit more.

If possible, allow the insulin to warm to room temperature before filling it. If I have to do an emergency change, I warm the insulin bottle with both hands.

Do not take off the cap until after priming is done.

Gently flick the insulin in the ""insertion window"" out of the pod after priming and removing the cap.

Peel one of the bottom stickers part way, then pull the other sticker off the whole way, then pull the first off the rest of the way.

Place the pod on the body. Avoid getting too close to the belly button.

Take a picture, or closely examine the ""injection window."" Note the inner shape of the plastic and how much insulin is stuck to it.

With one hand pinch the roll of fat under the pod as deep as possible. The goal is to bring up the pod without causing tension on the skin it is attached to. In other words, bring up the skin, but don't pinch it.

With the other hand start the pod and then immediately press down on the pod so that is is pushed gently into the skin. I try to make the skin look flat instead of bubbled at the top.

There is a random amount of time after you hear the pump clicking before you hear the snap of the cannula being inserted.

Note the amount of pain you felt. Pain is not necessarily a bad thing, but can sometimes indicate that you struck a vein.

Look at the top of the pod and make sure the little thin area window shows pink. (I've never had that fail).

Look at or take a picture of the insertion window and make sure the cannula is properly entering your skin.

Take your first bolus. I always change out before breakfast so I take around 10  units with my cereal.

After the pump is done clicking, take another picture of your insertion window and note if the shape of the liquid in the plastic has changed, if there are more or less bubbles of insulin, or literally any change at all. If anything is significantly different, the insulin may not be going into you.

Also, have someone who cares give it the sniff test. The amount of insulin will be very little and the amount of smell associated with a well installed pod will be learnable. Your family / friends will be able to tell you if the smell is too strong because the insulin is leaking under the pod into the adhesive.",diabetes_t1,1554478963,raydude,6,5,True,2019-04-05
rambling garbage. positive &amp; negative. read it if you are bored. ignore it if its too long and unfocused.,"thanks to the continual improvement of technology and the growth of knowledge via research I have been able to evade natural selection. having been diagnosed 37 years ago I have been through many stages of engagement in my own health. acceptance, resistance, denial, success, failure. I have seen many technologies come and go and I have relied on the grace of other who care for me, I have benefitted from the intellect and dedication of scientists, doctors, and educators. Diabetes was once a death sentence, thankfully that is no longer the case. this time in history is the best time to be a diabetic, CGMs, pumps, different types of insulin all make our lives easier and our control tighter and less stressful. I try hard to be grateful for the good thing surrounding this genetic hand I've been dealt. for a long time I lived as if tomorrow was uncertain, and in a large part I still feel that way, but I approach the ramifications of that idea differently. in my 20's this idea of cheating death made me feel fragile so I engaged in risky behavior, made bad decisions, and turned my back not he hard work others had done for  and with me to keep me alive. I have regrets about those bad decisions because they have boomeranged back to me, affecting my eyesight and feet. I can't take those choices back and I won't live with regret about them. I will confront the consequences and move forward. I have never ask for sympathy and I don't find it productive. I don't get angry when someone who doesn't know about my disease makes a comment about sugar, tells me ""you can't eat that"", or doesn't know that their grandma's type II is far different than my type I. In a moment like that I try to educate and grow awareness. I don't understand why there is a comorbidity of diabetes and depression but I live it, I feel it, I battle it every day. this is a heavy weight we all have to bear. I carry guilt for fighting my mother when she tried to deliver an injection to me at 6 years old, I feel angry at myself for keeping my wife up at night when I have an urgent low. but I also feel a sense of pride that I wake up everyday, that even though I have, in the past chosen not to fight, I wake up and face this disease head on. I have grown. I fight and I try and I do what I have to to stay alive. it's not easy for me right now and I want to say to all of my fellow type I soldiers, you can do this. you can fight another day. it's gonna hurt, you are going to cry, you are going to over bolus, over eat, forget to test, ignore your beeping CGM, but you're also gonna see a better A1C, your gonna eat an awesome meal that doesn't send you running for the keto sticks. I don't know what the hell I just wrote but as much as I am trying to convince you its gonna be ok I am trying twice as hard to convince myself.  I am currently searching for a reason to feel grateful to be upright today. we are beating natural selection and thats weird because it makes me feel proud and it also makes me feel like I don't really belong on this side of the dirt...",diabetes_t1,1554479692,silentaalarm,4,5,True,2019-04-05
Just Venting,"I've been t1 for 25 years. Pretty good control. A1cs from 6-mid9s, now rocking low 6s. I think I owe most of that to the Dexcom G6. I've been getting my G6 through insurance and Edgepark Medical with zero hassle... until last week. I placed a reorder back at the end of last month that would begin processing last week. I got an email saying that it is unable to process because it needs a doctors prescription. No biggie. Call the doctors office and left a message letting them know. The office calls back and tells me that insurance is asking for 6 months of doctors notes, lab results, glucose logs... 

Interesting since I've had the same insurance for years. 

I get everything together and fax it to Edgepark. I call them later in the day just to verify they got it. They told me it won't show up in their system until the next day. So, I call back the next day. They said they're now waiting on prior authorization from insurance. I call my insurance and they say that they've never received anything from Edgepark. I call Edgepark back and the nice person on the phone marks it urgent. The next day (today), I called Edgepark to get an update on the status. They claim they sent everything to insurance and are waiting to hear back. I call insurance and am told that they received everything, but the review will take 10 days! The only way to speed it up is if Edgepark calls and asks them to mark it urgent. So, I call Edgepark back and ask them to please call insurance and mark it urgent. They said they're ""putting in the request right now.""

So, needless to say, After several years with the same insurance and Edgepark, not having any issues, I'm now sitting with no CGM and will be potentially another two weeks before I get a new one.

I feel like a terrible diabetic,"I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago when I was 13. When I first was diagnosed I was so diligent. My a1c wasnt ever above 7.0. I was on shots for almost 4 years but wanted a pump the whole time. I was excited about the future of diabetes management and felt confident I could deal with it.

About 2 years after my diagnosis, my endocrinologist accused my dad of lying for me about my good habits of checking my blood sugars and managing it on my own. Apparently a teenager couldnt possibly be that responsible. It absolutely felt like a slap in the face for doing well.

Since then I've lost all motivation to even care about my diabetes. What's the point of taking care of it when your only criticized for not being a perfect diabetic?

A few months ago I managed to get my a1c down to 9.1 after YEARS of struggling around 10-12 a1cs. I know that's still not good but it was something. It was BETTER. But its been extremely difficult these past few months when I got fired from my job and lost my insurance. I have been stretching my insulin to last me as long as possible. That means my a1c got worse. I had it checked yesterday and I'm at 11 a1c. I'm so embarressed, yet I still just feel like it's all pointless. I'm going to die eventually, so why not sooner rather than later? It's a horrible way to live.

I see so many people on here managing their diabetes like it's nothing and I just simply dont understand how. I go to therapy, take antideppressents when I can afford them but I'm still a terrible diabetic. I'm so proud of you all for managing your diabetes like bosses but it makes me feel even more alone knowing that I dont do as good of a job.",diabetes_t1,1554434556,ane311,10,5,True,2019-04-04
Parent of a newly diagnosed T1 (15 year old),"Hi all,

I am not sure if this is acceptable or even the right place. I am just a bundle of questions and to be honest nerves atm.

&amp;#x200B;

My 15 year old was diagnosed with type 1 on Thursday last week after my wife took him to the docs and he had a HbA1c score of 166. 

The hospital (uk - NHS) was amazing, very helpful but bombarded us information. He responded very well to the insulin and was self testing and injecting the day he was admitted, and therefore was discharged home after only 48 hours (doctors told us it was one of their quickest turn arounds!)

&amp;#x200B;

 Yesterday the diabetes nurse came to the house and tried to give us some more information about how to manage his condition. If I am honest I have kind of been a bit numb of the whole thing - figuring ""yeah its a life long condition, he was close to a DKA and we have to be careful, but I guess it won't impact that much..."" (yeah maybe this is shock and disbelief and denial?)

&amp;#x200B;

After meeting with the nurse, I am left feeling wow it really does impact more than they kind of let on at first, she told us things like ""you will probs hypo a couple of times a week"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not 100% sure where I am going with this, but I guess I would like to ask for advice from other people who suffer with T1, is there anything you could suggest to make things easier for him? is there anything you would like to have known when you were first diagnosed that you know now? or am I being an over neurotic parent?

&amp;#x200B;

I must admit having this diagnosis for him has defo raised my awareness, and I have promised him I will be doing my part for fund raising etc for Diabetes UK.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, hope all is well!

My latest A1C is 9.5. I just got out of the eye doctors office from being told that she sees the early stages of retinopathy in both eyes.

I take Humalog (day) and Lantus (night). I test at least 5 times a day, if not more. I work out 4 days a week. I eat healthy. I'm otherwise perfectly healthy.

All any of the doctors ever tell me is 'Do better', but when I ask 'How? Any suggestions?' I just get blank stares back, and useless advice like 'Just have better control....'. Wonderfully useful advice. I've been referred to dieticians at least a dozen times, and it's the same bullshit. 'Okay, so here's how you carb count... Oh. You know this? Huh... Well... That was prettymuch all we had for you. Any questions?'

I carb count, or try to, but it never stops my sugars from being all over the place. I go low at least 4 times a week overnight, but my doctors just tell me to increase my nighttime dose of Lantus.

Cellnovo Out of Business,"Well this sucks!  Got my Cell-novo pump a few months ago, switched from Omnipod because Omnipod not available in Australia where I now live and Cellnovo was the only tubeless pump on the market. 

Finally coming around to getting used to it and maybe even liking it. But... they just went out of business and are discounting supply and manufacturing. 

Totally bummed. 

Now I have to either a) find a new pump that has tubes because there are no patch pumps in Australia or b) go back to MDI. 

A1C has been great and I attribute most of that to having a CGM but the patch pump works so well for my lifestyle and I really have to say it's been a big contributor to my A1C staying below 6.0 (can get it below 6.5 with MDI but have never been able to achieve tighter control without a pump). 

So what would you do if you were me? Take on the pump with tubes (based on research I'd probably go T-Slim) and maintain that 5.5-6.0 A1C or sacrifice the tighter control for the freedom of MDIs and be happy with a A1C in the 6.0-6.5 range?

Little background, when using MDI I totally don't mind taking needles but I tend to take one Lantus per day of 23 units and about 8-10 small injections of novorapid/novolog with meals snacks and corrections.

Today I had a meltdown in the doctors office.,"Sorry for the long post, and for formatting because I'm posting on mobile. 

Here is a little backstory.
I was diagnosed with LADA in late 2017. LADA is Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults. It's very similar to type one. But honesty I'm still really new and I'm still learning every day.
A few weeks ago I fucked up and ended up in the hospital with my blood sugars out of control. Today I went in and saw my primary care provider who has been there for most of my time as a diabetic. When she asked about if I had considered a pump, I broke down in tears. 
I work security for a living, which means I wear a bulletproof vest and gun belt every day. The thought of having a pump too just put me over the edge. 
I know that a lot of people use pumps, and they work great for them, but the thought of relying on a pump really scares me. Especially in my line of work. What if it it gets ripped out while I am working? I cant stop in the middle of my job, take off all my gear, and reset. Maybe I just dont know enough about them, but that thought alone is a huge turn off for me.
Luckily, my doctor is understanding, and doesn't push the issue. I know she just has my health in mind.

Some day I would really like to have a CGM to make it 1,000 times easier to manage my sugars, but I also know it's not perfect. Currently I have the Lebra Pro on so in a few weeks the doctor and I can talk about my patterns and what I need to change.

"Ready to upgrade my pump, need options","I'm using a Tandem G4 (with integrated Dexcom CGM).  **It's time for me to get a new pump**.  I am interested in upgrading it to a newer ""closed loop"" technology such as the  Basel-IQ.   I am **open to other devices** if they are are truly a step up from Tandem G4.  

My wish is to carry less stuff and certainly not more stuff as I go about my life.  That is, I don't want to carry both a pump and sensor receiver.  I do carry my iPhone with me most of the time, but not always.  It regularly goes into airplane mode to stop interruptions in important meetings, so the system must work when the phone is not connected to the internet (Bluetooth or similar is okay).

I'm mostly satisfied with the G4 sensors but understand there's greater accuracy with the newer G6 sensors.  The G4 sensors are not always perfect.  At times very accurate and other times wildly inaccurate (nearly always when I where it for more than 7 days).  I would like to hear personal experiences of someone who has moved from G4 to G6.  **How do G4 and G6 compare?**

About 6 years ago I used Medtronic CGM sensors in a ""open loop"" integrated CGM.  I felt completely frustrated with their incredibly high maintenance and lack of accuracy as compared to the Dexcom G4.  As a long time Minimed user pump user prior to the Tandem pump, I was very disappointed with my experience.  I'm very hesitant to move back to Medtronic after that experience.  **Does anyone have experience with Medtronic's closed-loop system and can say what are the advantages and challenges of the Medtronic system?**

**How close is the FreeStyle Libre  system to being integrated with a pump to make a closed-loop system?  Does anyone have information?  Which pumps?**

I have several friends who use the FreeStyle Libre and are very happy.  None of them have ever used a Dexcom or a closed-loop CGM integrated with a insulin pump.  I suspect their happiness is somewhat that they are happy with what they have vs what else is on the market.   **Does anyone have personal experience with Dexcom sensors (either G4-G5-G6) and FreeStyle Libre?  How does the day to day use compare?**

I also tried Omnipod for a few months about five years ago and had frequent occlusion errors and even pods falling off.  The BG meter/pod controller where nearly impossible to use in daylight.  **Has that Omnipod system improved in any significant way in the last few years?**

**Are there other options of which I am not aware?**

Just found this first post,"So I was diagnosed February 2018 and I just wanted a place to share how I got diagnosed.


So their were no signs at first we had no idea that I was diabetic so when I started getting symptoms we had all assumed that it was the flu I was throwing up everything that I ate and I felt sick all the time focusing was impossible I didn't even want to watch YouTube or read.

We were really confused because my temp wasn't high or anything but it was obvious that I was doing had so I stayed home and slept all day barely eating anything cause throwing up isn't fun and since we didn't know what was wrong they were giving me sprite smoothies and ice cream to help (it didn't).

We went to Care now and they also thought it was the flu so we were just told to wait it out and given advice then I started always drinking water I had quite a bit before but now I was always thirsty and I always had to piss which sucked cause I didn't want to move I remember waking up in the middle of the night trying to drink from my 36oz cup of water and literally just crying if I didn't have any cause I felt like shit and didn't want to go down the stairs

This continued for 1-2 weeks and I wasn't improving and my parents were worried cause I hadn't gotten sick in 6-7 years before this (idk good genes?) But other than being thirsty and pissing a lot throwing up wasn't to crazy for the flu and not wanting to eat (I starved myself those weeks and ate almost nothing I was getting THIN) so they didn't take me to a hospital or anything.

And then I started hallucinating and my mom said NOPE I was so bad that I was legit seeing things and didn't even know we were at our house (kept saying I wanted to go home (scared the shit out of my grandmother who's a nurse and hears that from dying patients)) my mom literally drags me from my room cause I insist that I'm fine and just want to lay down and drives me up to Care now where they (I assume) check my blood sugar  (around 500-600 cause I hadn't been eating and I was still pumping out a bit of insulin) and next thing I know I'm in an ambulance where I sleep cause I don't want to exist deal with anything (headache hungry tired thirsty) 


Then I'm in the hospital and I don't remember why but I wasn't aloud to eat for 24 hours (was at cook children's btw great people 10/10 never wanna go again) didn't even give me water (I hated it) just ice chips I was hungry from starving myself pissed cause the other patients never shut up so I could sleep the bed was uncomfortable cause I didn't have my own room and I hadn't eaten for 1-2 weeks 

Things did get better though and after the 24 hours I got my first meal that I didn't throw up in 2 weeks scrambled eggs sausage (ordered bacon But they didn't gimme t-t) milk and fruit loops.

I did hallucinate a bit more in the hospital some a bit more obvious than the others in order I SAW a spider hanging from the ceiling that scared the shit out of me when I thought that it disappeared cause it fell in my covers, a light show like multiple cat lasers of different colors with the beam visible and water dripping from the ceiling like rain.

He decides it must be 'out of control' diabetes causing my vomiting and refuses to do anything for me without ordering a blood test.  I tell him my hba1cs were taken 3 weeks ago and were 7.0 and offer to show him my CGM.  He says one reading 'here and there' doesn't prove control.  I try to explain that cGM gives a reading every 5 minutes and he cuts me off and tells me to go to the emergency room if I don't like his plan...

I try to tell him it's something I've experienced before and I just need to see the specialist who treated me last time.  He said he refused to give a referral until he is confident I don't have 'out of control diabetes', whilst refusing to look at my CGM graphs.

He prescribed me gaviscon FFS... I need IV fluids and an urgent referral to the specialist who sorted me out last time.


TLDR: 
Me- Hi locum doctor covering while my GP is away, I've had this illness before it was diagnosed by a consultant, I'd like a referral to see them please and some help managing the symptoms.

Doctor- No can do. It can't possibly be what you think it is. Despite the fact I've never met you, I'm convinced your diabetes is out of control and the cause for all of this. I refuse to give you the help you need until you take a blood test, that was fine when you took it 3 weeks ago.",diabetes_t1,1554151480,TinyFriend,7,12,True,2019-04-01
Fasting hypoglycemia prior to diabetes,"Prior to getting diabetes, whenever I would skip breakfast and lunch, I would get into a hypo. At least, I had all the symptoms I now recognise as hypo symptoms and they went away when consuming carbs. I figure it must have been some kind of hyperinsulinemia or something since it stopped specifically since I assumed control of my own insulin.

Infusion Set Troubles,"I started pumping again at the end of February with the tslim x2, was using MDI before that, and had a paradigm way before that.

This has happened 4 times since I started a month ago.  I never experienced this with the paradigm which I used for about four years.

I assume this is part operator error, and could improve as I learn where are the best areas for me personally to insert, but have others had similar experience?  Should I be considering the steel cannula/set?  I don't have scar tissue...

I keep gaining weight/having a rising A1C,"This is long, but I would really appreciate advice or just someone to talk to.

Over my high school years, my (I’m 17F) weight has slowly risen.  I’ve generally been bouncing between 145-150 for the past year or so, but lately I’ve been staying at 150, and then slowly rising and now I’m between 150-155.
My A1C as a child has always been either a little below or above 7, but now it hangs around 7.6
My end i suggests that I try and get my weight to around 145, and tells me he’s not very worried because I look generally healthy and have a “good” waist to hip ratio and most of the weight is in my thighs/butt, but I’m still very bothered by it.

I’ve kept a healthy diet all my life.  I try and incorporate vegetables into my meals, as well as lots of fruits.  I eat whole wheat bread and brown rice, and all that jazz.  My mom is very adamant about feeding me healthy options.  I do have a couple of snacks every day-usually a fruit or some type of cheese/but thing, but sometimes I’ll treat myself to chips or salty snacks like seaweed and such, or, rarely, sweets (sugary foods make me nauseous).  I used to have fits of hunger where I would just eat a crap ton of carbs (40g for a “snack” for ex.) but have stopped as it would spike my glucose and I felt it contributed to my weight gain.  Every Saturday, my family has pizza for dinner as a tradition which is when I have the most carbs. (Actual carbs of pizza is probably somewhere around 70, but I put 110 into my pump because my blood sugar will spike immensely otherwise)

Two weeks ago my blood sugar was going high like crazy, and I had ketones and had to miss school while my parents took me to the doctors and such to try and figure out what was going on.
The doctor gave me no diagnosis, but discovered I have a sharp pain in my right lower quadrant.  After ruling out appendicitis she suggested I could have an ovarian cyst.  A blood test confirmed nothing was wrong, except i had very low vitamin D and my A1C was now 7.9.

I’ve recovered and my blood sugar has been generally stable albeit a few off days, but I’m still gaining weight.  I weighed myself and I was 155lbs.  I’ve been feeling constantly guilty about anything I eat.  My school sold cookies this week which we pretty much only get once a year, so I bought two with a day in between to avoid eating too much at once, but now I’m just beating myself up over eating them because I feel like it’s my fault.
I’m debating skipping my breakfast and lunch and only eating a few snacks snacks and dinner in order to try and lower my daily carb intake, but don’t know how to convince my parents to let me.  I don’t know if maybe the possible ovarian cyst (I’m getting an ultrasound this week) is what’s causing the weight gain.  But I just feel really frustrated and fat and like a bad diabetic and miss being a skinner 130lb freshman.

Dexcom G6 smartwatch users: Does your watch vibrate for High and Low alert notifications?,"*I have already posted to* r/dexcom*, but thought I'd try here as well. No solution so far...*

My watch will not vibrate for glucose alerts. Anyone else have this problem? My Ticwatch S2 will only get the text notifications for High and Low alerts **without** it vibrating. I cannot figure out how to get my watch to vibrate for ANY Dexcom G6 notifications.

My Ticwatch S2 will vibrate just fine for any other notifications. Email, call, text, voicemail, etc.

I’m in the United States, have a Galaxy Note 8 running Android 8.0, and Dexcom G6 app version 1.4.0.4

My Ticwatch S2 is running Wear OS version 2.6, system version H. Notifications turned on for Dexcom G6 watch face. Notification previews set to high. Do not disturb when off wrist turned off. Vibration pattern set to double. Watch face set to tilt-to-wake and touch-to-wake.

On phone G6 app: Alerts set to Always sound turned on. Low alert set to &lt;80mg/dl = vibrate only. High alert set to &gt;240mg/dl = vibrate only. Rise and fall rate turned on with sound alert for both. All permission and notifications are allowed under app info in android.

I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling G6 app from phone and watch multiple times, resetting watch to factory settings and I even tried the modified G6 phone app (but found out it doesn’t support watch faces as far as I could tell).

I do still get this warning occasionally from the Dexcom G6 app on my phone saying that this version 1.4.0.4 has not been tested for my phone or android version, but if you go to the Dexcom website it says Note 8 w/android version 8.0 is compatible.

Any ideas? I’m about ready to buy another watch. Do other watches vibrate for the G6 watch face?

I don't trust my insulin pump,"I've always been suspicious of my insulin pump, and the way that manufacturers claim that they work.

For example, see this graph from today:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/to6cq6kbr5p21.jpg

You will notice that I had three hypos while in auto mode. I should also mention that the micro boluses given averaged about 0.1 unit. The baffling thing to me in particular is the last hypo - my actual reading was 38 when I checked... but there simply doesn't appear to be that much insulin in my system per the above graph. Now, to add to the picture, I did bolus 6 units at lunch (12PM) to cover for roughly 55g of carb, which was roughly five hours before the last hypo started to trend down. This would indicate potentially that my insulin from lunch is affecting the above reading. The insane thing is though, the total correction for the hypos is 90g of carb; way more than the 55 I had for lunch. You may be thinking, ""Well, you're taking too much insulin"". This could be true. However, if I don't take the insulin per my current I:C, my sugar will absolutely skyrocket (300+ within half hour) if I eat so much as a few grams of carb. Is 55g of carb really that much? 

My theory is that larger insulin boluses sit around in these damn infusion sites for longer than the pump manufacturers state that they do, vs injections wherein they seemed to be closer to the standard 2-4 hours active insulin time.

Sorry for the rant. Its just that Medtronic has always touted that you can ""eat what you want"" (anyone remember the picture of the woman eating the massive piece of chocolate cake on their enlite sensor manual), but to me, it seems like I might simply have to go the Bernstein low carb approach, which TBH, sucks.

"Asking for a friend. Sensor/pump combos, what are your setups?","Asking for my fiancé. She’s had enough bad experiences with older pumps and pods where she’s been a finger pricking and insulin pen gal for years now, so we were out of the loop for some time. Recently, she tried her first few Libre sensors and loves it.



Now, she’s willing to open up and try some new systems out there, but here are her two major no-nos:

-Pump with tubes

-Pumps/sensors that notify locally of issues (Omnipods beeping incessantly when she bumps a wall or wakes her up when she’s sleeping type of stuff, but even as good of an idea as low/high notifications are I can already see her shouting “I KNOW!!” at her arm and ripping it off if they become intrusive)



She’s going to give the Dexcom a shot next (Libre’s accuracy fluctuates as I’m aware is a known issue), and she seems open to a new pod system, maybe even something with tubes but I know she’d have a better shot sticking to it with tubeless.

birth control for normalizing monthly bg swings?,"Ladies-- My insulin sensitivity has been swinging drastically on a roughly monthly-basis. I only figured this out recently because, well, honeymoon. I'm currently not on a hormonal birth control, and my irregular cycle makes predicting my changing insulin needs really tricky. During the week of my would-be period (which I don't get for some reason), I'll have 4(ish) days where I should increase my basal by 50% and double my ICR, followed abruptly by 3 days where I shut off my basal entirely. I've tried not adjusting my basal during these few crazy days, but I'll run above 200 for much of the first 4 days and then repeatedly drop below 70 the later set of 3 days. That change from low to high sensitivity is really abrupt, and it's hard to not feel like my body is trying to kill me. I've tried tracking when this happens, and it seems it is monthly plus/minus a week. 

Has anyone tried adding hormonal birth control to make their insulin sensitivity a little more predictable throughout the month? I asked my endo about it and he just told me that I need to see an OB, who likely will not have had much experience with T1 patients. Ideally there would be something that makes the lady hormones constant throughout the month (maybe taking the pill but skipping the placebo week?) but I'd be happy with just knowing what days my blood sugar will be running high or low.

Should I be angry and switch doctors?,"So this is likely to be a wall of text but the details are important to the story. Bear with me.

When I was first diagnosed as diabetic at all it was following a week long water drinking binge without ever not feeling thirsty. A lot of you know exactly what this is. I went to an urgent care thinking it was a vitamin deficiency and thus started my journey. They told me to go to the ER, I did, and was diagnosed as Type 2 diabetic. I established a relationship with a Primary care physician at that point.

So life went on and I started taking oral meds for my new diagnosis. My doctor told me that I stood a chance at reversing this diagnosis and getting off all meds altogether so I bought in. Started hardcore dieting. Working out and moving around more than usual. Those sorts of things. And I was shedding weight insanely fast. I was diagnosed Type 2 at 275 pounds. By the time everything was said and done I was down to 160 (I'm 6'7"" tall). This took about 10 months. I should have been alarmed but I thought I was kicking diabetes' ass so I didn't change anything.

Then one day I woke up and I felt very off. I decided to go downstairs and get a glass of water. I passed out at the top of the stairs and took a nasty fall. Nothing was broken so I took a bit and got up and made myself go to work. I was at work for 30 minutes before I made myself go to the ER. Of course my blood sugar was sky high and it was that day I was diagnosed with Type 1. I'm still not entirely sure how they confirmed that diagnosis. After starting insulin therapy my quality of life returned and things got immensely better.

My new endocrinologist told me I had been in diabetic ketoacidosis for probably the better part of the entire time I was misdiagnosed as type 2 and that I had virtually run out of weight to lose. ""It was a matter of time before someone found you passed out or dead."" he told me. And in full disclosure, in the time between being misdiagnosed as T2D and being correctly diagnosed as T1D, I was not checking my sugars and didn't own a glucometer. My doctor said I could beat it and I was hell bent on doing it. In hindsight that decision could have killed me but alas.

So my question is should I have any faith in that Primary care doctor still? My wife doesn't like him and thinks he was guilty of malpractice and responsible for nearly killing me. I think he is a nice guy that is trying his best and I should have been a better advocate in my care. I am needing to make an appointment with a primary care because of some other stuff so that is what is bringing this question up. I'm interested to see what an unbiased opinion things.

Does it ever get easier? [vent],"Hello y’all. 

I’m 21 years old and I was diagnosed with type 1 a year ago. I checked into crisis care for mental health issues and was diagnosed shortly after this because my blood sugar was off the meter. 

I have had depression for years before my diagnosis, but had really hoped treating my diabetes would cure my depression. 

While getting on insulin and getting a CGM certainly helped, I still suffer from depression and resulting sleep issues quite a bit, and not controlling my sugars exacerbates these issues so much. I struggle with motivation to shower a lot of days, let alone do a series of injections. I have insomnia so I really struggle to get to sleep, but once I’m asleep it’s like I’m velcroed to my bed. My blood sugar is typically high overnight and it makes getting up 10 times harder. Do any of y’all experience this? 

I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point with the sleep issues. Even with sleep meds, I’m borderline nocturnal and can barely get out of bed. This had caused me to miss class (college student) and fall behind as well as miss important health appointments. 

I’m just so sad, tired and overwhelmed. Between being in recovery and only 6 months sober, depression and anxiety, sleep issues and diabetes, as well as school and work and therapy, I feel so overwhelmed and incapable of succeeding. 

To top it all off, I am a man of transgender experience (meaning I was assigned female at birth and am transitioning to male and use masculine pronouns) and I am planning on a transitional surgery at the end of the year. My A1C is currently a 7.7 and I need at least a 7.5 to safely get surgery. But my diabetes is so hard to control that I am constantly stressed I cannot get this extremely important surgery. It’s just more added pressure, but I need the surgery so not getting it isn’t an option. 

I just feel so alone. In most trans spaces, no one has type one, and in most type one spaces almost no one is trans. I wish there were more resources out there for me or I had someone to turn to. I am honestly mad at the world that I have diabetes and mental illnesses on top of being trans, especially because diabetes makes getting surgeries even harder than it already is. 

So I guess the big question is, does it ever get easier to be diabetic? Does anyone have advice for me on overnight blood sugars and sleep issues, particularly getting out of bed? Has anyone else had to get a surgery and needed to get their a1c down? Is anyone else recovering from addiction or mental health issues?

"Humalog doesn't work for me, new Endo won't take me seriously..."," 

Quick backstory: I suffer from depressive mental health issues on top of Type 1 Diabetes. I have always put my T1D on the backburner because I didn't really care about my health/life that much. I'm on a pump.  
Well, I **finally** decided to get on top of things and do better. With a lot of effort and determination, I got to where my bloodsugars didn't go above 150 for weeks at a time. That may not seem like a big deal to most, but it was night and day difference for me coming from bloodsugars that frequently just read 'HI' on my meter.

After a couple of months of finally feeling better and being able to see the light, my insurance stopped covering Novolog and switched me to Humalog. My understanding was that it was just repackaged Novolog as a generic...which I didn't have a problem with. I don't care if something is generic or not as long as it works. That being said, Humalog absolutely does not work as well for me. I am having to use quite literally 4-5 times the amount of insulin for it even to have an effect...and my bloodsugar still ends up being high. Not ONE single thing has changed in my routine except the insulin. Not one. No environmental changes, no med changes, no extra stress...nothing.  
I have been T1D for almost 20 years so I know how things work. I am going through an entire BOTTLE of insulin in just a few days....

I had an endo appointment today with a doc I've never seen. Not only did I feel like I was bothersome to her because I wasn't a simple in-and-out case...but she said things like:

""Your blood sugar was only 438 when you came in""

""Humalog not reacting with patients the same way as Novolog is uncommon"" (in a dismissive tone, then moved on because it was uncommon).

I *begged* her to help me--I am having BS's of 400-600+ basically 24/7 and I feel like I am literally dying. I'm waking up with numb fingertips, my whole body is tired, my joints hurt, I am constantly dehydrated, I'm having heart palpitations...  
I begged her to even put me on a different insulin or give me Symilin or something to help increase the effectiveness of my insulin if she wasn't going to give me another.

In the end, she gave me a log to fill out and said if I'd fax it back she would work on adjusting my basal. Which I've already done and it's 5 times what it was before. That's all she offered.

**TLDR;** Insurance stopped covering Novolog and had to switch to Humalog. Humalog doesn't work for me. Has this happened to you? If so, how did you handle it? What meds did your doc have you add or what insulin did you switch to? (I am on a pump)",diabetes_t1,1553527053,hfuga,85,41,True,2019-03-25

Ketones with perfect blood sugar,"Hi everyone, just wondered if anyone else has experienced the above. I’ve been producing medium to large amounts of ketones in my pee the last week, but have had really good blood sugars. 

I went to see my diabetic nurse today as I was unsure if it was a cause for concern or not where I haven’t had high blood sugars, and the only other symptoms I’ve been having of DKA is the acetone breath and nausea in the mornings. She told me the reason I’m having a problem with ketones is that my body is burning fat instead of carbs and that I need to up my carb intake otherwise I could cause damage to my body. 

Problem is I’m averaging 100-120 grams of carbs a day; mainly through fruit and veg as I also have celiac disease and gluten free options aren’t great in my area or cheep. My understanding is in order to be keto you are supposed to be eating less then 30 grams a day? 

I don’t know, her answer seemed odd and she didn’t really seem sure of herself, so it’s causing me to second guess what she said and stressing me out that I could be doing more harm by increasing carbs while I have high ketones already. Tried to google what was happening but I wasn’t really getting any clear answers. I know I could go to the hospital for a second opinion, but I would like to avoid that if I could as I’m going on a trip in a few weeks and if I go to the hospital 6 months before my trip, my insurance won’t cover me if something diabetes related were to happen while I was away.",diabetes_t1,1553550549,Mad-X,10,5,True,2019-03-25

"Diabetes, depression and ADHD","I’ve had type 1 for 14 years this spring and can say confidently its had its fair share of ups and downs. When I was first diagnosed at 9 years old, I seemed to accept it with little to no trouble and adjusted to the lifestyle fairly quickly. Sure, it was tough, especially as a kid, but I always tried my best to remain positive and figured if i was to have a chronic disease I’d prefer it to be something like type 1 diabetes and not something more fatal. I’ve also always struggled with depression and ADHD, which as you can assume took quite the toll on my diabetes management and overall mental health. Despite struggling with depression and ADHD, I was always on top of my diabetes management trough grade school and high school (which I largely attribute to my mom’s help and guidance). However, once I went to college it all changed. I moved across the country and was on my own for the first time in my life, surrounded by completely new people in a state I had never even visited before and consequently, my lifestyle completely changes as well. With the pressure from school, drinking and horrible eating habits, my diabetes management quickly fell by the wayside. 

I began checking less and less frequently and started taking my health less seriously as I went through college. I was unmedicated for both my ADHD (which only seemed to get worse with stress from both my health and school) and my depression during college, and besides from talk-therapy I felt as though I had no outlet. It became a constant and exhausting loop: stress/adhd —&gt; not  taking care of myself —&gt; denial —&gt; depression/guilt. 

My ADHD and depression quickly became insurmountable. I went into a weird phase of denial where I just would push my health and diabetes into the corner of my mind. I practically pretended like I didn’t have a chronic illness at all, and in a weird way it felt liberating. For once in my life, I didn’t feel as ostracized, didn’t feel like a burden to my friends and wasn’t  constantly worried about my future health. The denial was deep; I would first go weeks without testing my blood sugar, then months. 

By the end of my senior year in college, I was testing my blood sugar once a month on average (if I was lucky!). I pushed it so far out of my mind that the idea of going back to managing my diabetes felt way too overwhelming. The guilt and depression manifested as anger and I would take it out in several different ways: blowing up at my friends over really trivial things, self-hatred, and indulging in really risky behavior. I gave myself a “timeline”, and in it I only saw myself living to 38-45 because of my poor diabetes management and risky behavior with drugs and alcohol. Drugs quickly became an escape mechanism, and a dangerously effective one at that. At this point, I just didn’t care. 

Around this time, I was hospitalized for DKA and put in the ICU for a week and a half. I’ve never felt worse in my life. I truly thought it was the end and that I was dying. I had no energy, couldn’t even stand without falling over, threw up everything I put into my body and just generally felt like the life had been sucked out of me. I was telling myself that “I knew my body” and could “read the signals of low/high blood sugar with little to no effort at all”. My hospitalization made me quickly realize that that wasn’t so. I wish I could say that it was a wake-up call, but it wasn’t. It only sent me into further denial and served as a sort of “threshold”, which I’d use to justify my reckless behavior. I would tell myself, “being in the hospital wasn’t *that* bad.” And it gave me the ability to falsely rationalize my inability to manage my health and life in general. 

Now I’m graduated college, looking for a job and still struggling immensely with my diabetes management, ADHD and depression. Having diabetes is a curse in itself, but coupled with mental illness and attention deficit disorders feels like a death sentence. I feel helpless and like such a burden, not only to my family and friends but to myself. In the meantime, I’ve met with a psychiatrist to treat my ADHD with medication. I plan on taking my depression more seriously as well, and will be seeking therapy soon. Has anyone else here dealt with depression and ADHD? What is your advice on how to turn my life around?

Diagnoses stories,"I'm not sure if it's been done here or not, so I apologise if it has, but I thought it would be cool to do a thread over everyone's diagnosis stories since it's the craziest part of having diabetes

Here's mine:

I was in third grade, May 12th, 2009 I believe. For the past couple of weeks I had to go the bathroom ALL of the time. I think it started to annoy my teacher with how often I requested to use the restroom lol. 

Over the weekend we went to see family in OKC and my father started to notice I wasn't as energetic as I usally am (my father is also a type 1 diabetic). On Sunday when we got home he had me test my blood sugar for the first time on his personal blood sugar meter. My blood sugar came out to 553(ish). 

My dad had a quiet conversation with my mother and we went to the emergency room. We pretty much knew I was diabetic as soon as we got the meter results, but I wasn't diagnosed until early the next morning. My parents kept it together pretty well while all this happened and I found myself in a room watching the Iron Giant at 11pm at night. 

When the clock turned to 12am I turned to my mother and told her happy mother's day. I have never in my life seen my mother cry that hard. It broke my heart. 

After the doctor came and talked to us and let me leave my brother and sister presented me with a bag of beef jerky. They told me they had dug around our old Ford expedition for loose change in order to buy it from the vending machine because they knew it had no carbs so I could eat it. 

We went home and watched a movie as a family with a pallet in the living room. I later learned that my uncle called and told my father if we needed anything at all to just let him know and he would get it for us (my uncle also has type 1 diabetes).

The worst part of that night was definitely them taking the IV out of my arm. The adhesive they use on those are no joke!!

 It was a sad day, but I'm thankful for my diabetes. It's made me all the better of a person. ",diabetes_t1,1553465520,Mr_Glucose,13,6,True,2019-03-24

Honeymoon phase question,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with T1 just a little over year ago. I fortunately caught it very early and the way it was detected was relatively harmless (UTI that wasn't healing, urine test showed sugar). 

Anyway, it was initially misdiagnosed as T2 and for the first 5 months I didn't take any insuling, just Metformin, but was never terribly high. Despite that, it's now been over a year, and I am still clearly honeymooning - I bolus before meals, but only take lantus once per day in the morning as my blood sugar goes down naturally during the night and when I wake up it's normally between 90 and 100. 

So the question is: when the honeymoon phase ends, is it normally quite abrupt or is it gradual? How long did it last for you? I'd be good to hear about other people's experiences so I know what i can expect.

Using Unofficial App/Xdrip+ Android AND G6 Receiver Simultaneously,"I'm trying to upgrade my 5 year old's G6 setup in preparation for kindergarten and am hoping for some info on technical limitations.

We currently pair to my wife's iPhone while also using the receiver (plus Dexcom Share on my phone).  When she goes to pre-school, her teachers use the receiver, and we get no data while she's there, obviously.  I purchased a Unihertz Jelly with the hope that I could pair to it and keep it on her at school to get readings while still using the receiver because it's easier for teachers to use than messing with a phone (not to mention that I don't want her or others messing with the phone).

So last night I uninstalled the official app on my wife's iPhone and paired to the Jelly with Xdrip+.  With the transmitter in range of both the receiver and the Jelly, I got 3 readings from the Jelly, then nothing for an hour or more.  The receiver got readings fine for that hour.  I tried messing with all kinds of settings in Xdrip, but nothing got it to reconnect.  I tried the unofficial Dexcom app on the Jelly and got one reading, but then nothing else.

It seems clear that there is a bluetooth issue between the Jelly and receiver that does not occur with the iPhone.  Is this a device specific issue, or is there a configuration that might let them both get readings simultaneously?

I read somewhere that the transmitter has two bluetooth channels - one for receiver and another for a phone so I'm wondering if you can somehow choose which channel is used?  I don't know if this information is actually true...

"Anyone had a ""pump holiday?""","I'm feeling exasperated. I went on the pump close to 2 years ago but it's never really been a smooth ride. It didn't help that I got ill right after starting the pump, deteriorated over the next 6 months or so while the doctor tested for everything under the sun, eventually found out it was likely coeliac then I had to go through all the diagnostics to confirm it, then I had to switch my diet, heal up my guts and start absorbing food again which was throwing off my pump settings all the time. Even now it seems something will work for a month or so then everything shifts again. Plus my BGs start dropping around 11am and by 2pm I'm in a full hypo which has me groggy as hell all afternoon. That never happened on the jabs and I just want my life back.

I've been at the clinic today and the team suggest taking a pump holiday for a month then going back to square one with it. Now I was never well-controlled on the jabs as dawn phenomenon mucked up the mornings, but at least I was able to function and not hypo all afternoon!

Tips for not going low during cardio?,"Hey all-type one for about 8 years

In the past year I’ve made a great deal of lifestyle changes by working out and cutting basically all simple carbs. I’ve lost just over 35 lbs and am within 10 of my goal weight. Yay! My insulin requirements are about a third of what they used to be and overall I feel great!

Now the shitty part is, I got so healthy that now I’m not health anymore because I bottom out at the gym. 
I like to do 60 min of cardio about five times a week. I used to be able to turn my basal rate down or to zero but now even if I eat enough to get to 190, and turn my basal rate to zero I’m still dropping to or below 60 by the end of my workout. It is very annoying to have to plan my work outs around meals- particularly when I’m still trying to lose the last few pounds.

Should your basal insulin try to cover some of your carb intake?,"Should your slow acting insulin dose be purely decided based on BG drop over time when there is no input of carbs or fast acting insulin?  


I have a quite a high carb intake, so I'm often injecting 15-22 or more units of fast acting per meal.  


Currently my Lantus is 32 once a day. but my BG drops over time between meals. so I may reduce my Lantus further (I already reduced from 36 recently).  


I know there's always been this 50:50 (or other percentages) theory for slow vs. fast acting insulin.  
Is that totally disregarded these days?  


If I can get my Lantus dose correct so that my BG stays level overnight and between meals (when I don't have a snack), plus inject the right amount of fast so that I'm at a good BG number 2 hours after I eat, am I all good?

But I need your help.

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Communication Studies Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, specializing in interpersonal health communication. I'm dedicating my research to learning how to most effectively support someone with a chronic illness (such as, but not limited to,diabetes).

I'm currently working on my dissertation, which is a two-part study exploring how chronic illnesses of all types impact one's identity, which may affect one's support-seeking communication. Are you:

* at least 19 years old,
* currently living in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, and
* diagnosed with a chronic illness in 2008 or later?

If so, your experience is important to me, and I would appreciate your participation in my current study. Participants will be asked to complete a **short (12 to 20 minutes), IRB-approved, online survey** regarding their health, communication preferences, and relationships with others. Answers will be anonymous and kept confidential. I'm looking for a wide variety of diagnoses, symptom severity, experiences and opinions -- your voice DOES matter.

ADHD and Type 1 Diabetes,"TL/DR:  I could use some suggestions based off of what you know or have experienced. ADHD and T1. Tips or precautions? Also, is there any ADHD medicine that adversely effects your sugar? 

I have had T1 for 21 years now. If I'm honest, I've not had good control in a while. More accurately, I'll have a few weeks of good control, then a month of bad control, then back to ok/good, and on and on. But I've not had consistently good control in a while. Oh yeah, I also have ADHD. When I have good control of my blood sugar I can generally manage ADHD, which helps me manage my diabetes, it's a vicious cycle. When it is out of control (kicked off by any number of things), there is no management of things like remembering important things to do (such as checking my sugar, take insulin on time, insert my cgm, daily tasks, etc), inattentive, impulse control, all the above. 

I have not previously pursued medication for ADHD, but now I'm thinking I probably should and that it might help to keep me in control with diabetes as well. Again, it's a vicious cycle.

Burnout in teen,"My 15 year old has had T1 for seven years. She’s had a tough road for a lot of reasons that aren’t even diabetes related, but of course it’s always been an added layer of wtf-ness. She uses a pump and a Dexcom (G6). Our last order of sensors got back ordered so we’re in the middle of a two week wait to get more. No big deal. We love the dexcom but it’s not unusual for her to take a break from it sometimes. 

Well we went out for lunch ch yesterday and she was annoyed because she forgot to charge her meter so she was waiting for it to come back to life with one of those portable chargers. Again, minor annoyance. She didn’t seem super stressed about it and we weren’t either. But, just making conversation, I did say something along the lines of are you missing the dexcom? This is when she kind of unloaded, saying she didn’t care, it sucked regardless, she was really freakin sick of having diabetes no matter what and nothing makes it better, etc etc. 

In the moment, just trying to diffuse the situation, her dad and I did our best to empathize and support her, and also reiterated that even though it’s no ones fault that her pancreas crapped out, it’s all of our responsibility to manage it even when it sucks ass. She did calm down relatively quickly, and that was kind of that. But I know her well enough to know that was the tip of the iceberg. 

I know the obvious answer here is that diabetes burnout is a very real thing, painfully common among T1 teens, and she needs counseling. And I totally agree. She needs counseling for a lot of things and she has been in and out over the years. But the poor kid just doesn’t want to go. She’s so over it. I know we’re the parents here and we can force the issue but I am struggling with forcing her to do more diabetes-related shit she just doesn’t want to do. I mean, damn. I’m with her on this. I’m freaking sick of it too. I hate this for her more than I have words for. 

So I turn to you, T1s of Reddit. With the full understanding that counseling is probably where we’ll end up on this, are there things we can do at home or in conjunction with her school nurse, etc., to help combat this in other ways? Do we enroll her in a sport or an acting class or something to distract her? Do we go full force and talk about it a lot to get it out in the open? Or do we just say screw it and keep beating the dead horse with therapy? I am just clueless and my heart hurts for my poor kid.

"Some questions about high carb foods, glycemic indices, ketogenic diets, exercise, etc.","So I'm recently diagnosed (about six weeks ago, where I presented with DKA and an HbA1c of 14.3) and I'm currently eating very high carb (like 200g to 500g daily), but doing fine with regards to control (at least so far as my frequent blood tests can tell me - I don't have a CGM or an FGM), though only when I stick with low to medium glycemic index foods. As soon as I eat foods with a higher glycemic index, I get pretty large spikes as is probably to be expected.

Anyway, over at r/diabetes, people seem to swear by the ketogenic diet and not think of anything else as an adequate option. I have already been referred to [bloodsugar101.com](https://bloodsugar101.com) several times by people trying to convince me I need to cut carbs. There are various reasons I am unwilling to do this. It's interesting how people can agree that a general etiquette for talking to diabetics is to not give unsolicited dieting advice, but then feel justified in ignoring that principle just because they're diabetic themselves. I keep being told that it will be impossible for me to maintain control when my honeymoon period ends (I don't actually know if I'm in a honeymoon period) unless I reduce my carb consumption, so I've been wondering - assuming I do get a Libre at some point and I exercise regularly, will it really be that difficult for me to maintain good control on a high carb diet?

Also another thing I've been thinking about is getting Afrezza or Fiasp in addition to my Novorapid to use for higher glycemic index foods. Have any of you been doing this? If so would you recommend it? Another approach I've thought of is to prebolus with an increased dosage compared to the carb contents in the high GI food and then cover the difference with some low GI food a bit later. This is not too different from the advice I got by my dietician to eat low GI carbs at the side whenever I am eating a high GI meal. Have any of you had success with this?

Also suppose for the sake of the argument that I had a choice between doing a lot of regular exercise at predictable times (like every other day in the afternoon) or alternatively restricting my carb intake, but I was unable to do both, which would be more helpful?",diabetes_t1,1552924770,Kalcipher,10,2,True,2019-03-18

I’m starting to burn out. I’ve been sick a lot this winter, it feels like I’m never healthy even when I’m as healthy as possible, I have to start thinking about insurance now that I’m a “real adult”, and today my CGM has been acting weird and I have ketones for no reason. Seriously, sometimes I feel like I have easy days and it’s not so bad, but days like today have me feeling so defeated. 

I worry a lot that, although I’m in all around good health, I’ll end up dying early just because I have diabetes. Or that I’ll have a miserable life once I’m older. I’m young now and I already feel horrible and sick a lot, what’s going to happen as I age? They told me I had kidney damage when I was sixteen, and even though they got it under control, it was literally diagnosed as “sometimes this just happens to diabetics”. I feel like no matter how well I take care of myself, I’m doomed to be sick and have my body give out on me.

I feel so worn down and just plain tired of doing this.",diabetes_t1,1552949632,thespicyfoxx,3,5,True,2019-03-18
DexCom app help,"Hi, I'm hoping someone can help me. My dad has been using the Dexcom for about a year and has the app on my mom's phone to monitor with glucose. This is the G5 app or something. \[All phones are android if that helps\]

someone help:(,"i was diagnosed when i was 7-8, and when i turned into a teenager my sugar levels weren’t really that great, they were high a lot of the time (often above 10, 20s weren’t uncommon) don’t get me wrong i wasn’t high constantly, i did have good moments, and moments where i was in hypos but my sugars were high quite a lot. when i went to check ups my hba1c was always around where it should be (i never understood how?!) sometimes a tiny bit higher than it should be, but mostly on target. i’m 19 now, and for the past week and a half i’ve REALLY clamped down on my sugars, i’ve completely cut out most foods because i’m now too paranoid and scared of my sugars going high, i go low 4-5 times a day and wake up at some point in the night, every night feeling very dizzy and low so i have to then eat bad food to get my sugars back up, but my sugars in general the past week n a half have been super super good, exactly in target range apart from going low a lot now, i’m just scared because for the 4-5 years my sugars weren’t great, i’m terrified i’ve developed kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease and several different kinds of cancer, i haven’t slept in weeks because i haven’t been able to take my mind off it all, i’ve been so fucking upset, i should probably mention that i also suffer with psychosis (been “suffering” with it for nearly a year) i don’t take any of my medications anymore, i stopped all that cold turkey a few months ago. i just don’t know what to do, i rang the gp today to ask about some blood test results because months ago i had my bloods done but i never heard anything back about it, so i phoned up to ask and she said that normally if you don’t hear anything back that means everything is clear and not to be worried, but my mind isn’t at rest:( i have a gp appointment on the 20th of this month but i’m absolutely fucking terrified to go, i don’t wanna find out if i actually do have any of those diseases because if it all ends up being true which i seriously think it will be, i know i will not be able to continue living life anymore, my quality of life is already poor as fuck due to psychosis so any of those diseases just tops it for me. i wish euthanasia was legal in the UK, that way it would be less difficult for people around me rather than them hearing from the police that i committed suicide, i know i shouldn’t say that but suicidal thoughts are top priority in my mind, they don’t go away, they follow me around and stick by my side. so that’s it i guess, i’m ready to get replies telling me that i’m going to die, i’m expecting it, it’ll still hurt but what does it matter anyway, i’m a piece of shit and i deserve every bad thing that comes my way.

Roommate/Brother in law/friend can't care for himself.,"Hey everyone, sorry if this isn't allowed but im not sure where to go.

  


Ive recently had my fiance's step brother and his gf move in with me, they're good kids but neither know how to care for his type 1 diabetes, despite him being almost 22.

  


I think it's never been enforced at home, but it's becoming a concern.

  


In the last 6 months I've found him collapsed and unresponsive 4 times, 3 of those in the last fortnight.

He will not test unless made to. Which I feel awful about making him, but last time he was found unconscious he was at 1.9 and had a seizure where he concussed himself on my sternum.

  


His father has lost toes and is at constant risk of losing a foot, he has had countless scares but thinks he is an exception, saying things like:

  


""I used to get to 1.9 all the time, it never hurt me before""

  


""Someone would of found me before it got bad""

  


""My body has always gone from super high to really low""

  


  


He's stepmother and his father are telling him its normal to wake up at 3.5 ish and that 19.2 is completely fine, and he believes them.

I want to help him without overbearing him, but if I push to hard he will go back to his grandmother's place where she doesn't monitor him at all.

  


Sorry about the info dump, I really don't know what is important and what isn't. Me and my fiance are educating ourselves as much as possible but there is so much to learn.

  


He has a pump, but he never touches it unless he has to change the insulin, not even when he is eating or working.

  


We are in Australia so cost isn't really an issue for him treating himself.

  


Basically if you guys have any advice or good resources that would be amazing.

Alternately, I'd also love to know he is right and im overreacting but the passing out seems to say otherwise.

  


Again sorry for the confusing info dump, I'm just confused and if im honest im also terrified. I will clarify anything I can in the comments.

  


  


Thank you.

Weird T1 Blood Tests,"So I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet... Wish me luck. 

Dx May 2008 at age 13 with bg 553. Honeymooned from summer 2008 to Winter 2010 to the point of no insulin at all (including lantus). Rediagnosed T2 and perceived metformin (didn't take it bc I was a little shit and felt fine without it + had good bg).

During that 1.5 year period had every kind of test done but I don't remember the results. I was for all intents and purposes a mystery case. 

Broke honeymoon with super high bg and rerediagnosed T1. From there it was super typical T1 treatment. 

Everything's going good, but last year decided to get a c-pep done bc it's 100% covered. Came back in the normal range (???). Got antibody tests and turns out I have anti-insulin antibodies galore. Last two c-peps (now I get them about 6 months apart to keep an eye on them) were slightly lower than normal but definitely not 0.

So my question: has anyone else had a c-pep in normal/near-normal range multiple years out? Should I be worried about my immune system since it's obviously trying to kill my beta cells but can't seem to?

It turned out his test strips had expired and he hadn't realized. He bought a new glucose monitor and new strips 2 days and he is consistently testing between 200 and 300.

"Diabulimia research study, opportunity to win a gift card!","Hello! My name is Nicole Antoniadis, and I am a graduate student at Pacific University in Hillsboro, Oregon, USA. I am currently completing my dissertation on the effect of coping strategies on anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia (which is the omission or manipulation of insulin doses for the purpose of weight loss). This study aims to identify specific styles of coping which prove to be effective at decreasing the impact of anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia. These co-occurring problems can make recovery intensely difficult, so identifying more effective coping styles may lead to more successful treatment strategies.

"I don't really know what this is. Just me, a word document and my story.","Conquering your inner “It.”
Beating Diabetes Burnout

   We’ve all experienced it. “Maybe if I ignore it, act like it doesn’t exist, it will go away.” Whether your “it” is a class you’re failing, your clingy girlfriend or your autoimmune disease that you are required to maintain every day, we all have our own “it.” But what happens when the burden that you chose to ignore, doesn’t care whether you want it to exist or not? Is the effort you exert really worth the life you will lead to live? Or are you so arrogant that you believe you are the one that, “Beats the Odds,” as they say?  Let me take you through the journey of my own “It.” A little thing my endocrinologist calls, “Diabetes Burnout.”

   ‘BRR BRR’ Your cellphone is vibrating for the 27th time today because you didn’t show up for your 7 o’clock dinner date last night with your girl. It’s only been three months since you decided, “to take things serious,” as the kids call it these days. ‘We’re done, all guys are the same and you are no different,’ the new text notification says. Mission Accomplished, no more girl holding you down, nobody to tell you what to do. Simple right? Just ignore the text and go about your life, happy and care free. Now, what if there were no text messages? What if, you missed the date, but when you get home the next day after a long day at work, she’s still there acting like nothing ever happened. Better yet, she’s already setting up your next date, and you already know you’re going to skip that one too. Welcome to the life of a Type One diabetic. Whether it’s not checking your sugar or not giving yourself the insulin required for the cookie you just snuck by, no matter how much you ignore it, diabetes isn’t going tell you “we’re done.” She’s locked in and ready for the long haul. “Until Death Do Us Part,” but what I had failed to realize was Death was on my doorstep and this marriage between my diabetes and myself was on a crash course to an abrupt end. 

   First, let me take you down the “Highway to Hell,” that I was on with my diabetes. I was done. I was defeated and I no longer felt like the hand I was dealt, was the hand I was supposed to hold. To this day I remember the look on my mom’s face, and the tears in my dad’s eyes when the ER nurse looked at me and said, “Your life as you know it, is over.” Now, I don’t believe the nurse was attempting to be malicious or rude at that moment, but the life of a typical 17 year old who is attempting to fit in with all of his buddies, isn’t a life that a Type 1 diabetic should live. Well, for me anyway. “We’ll do this together,” I can still hear my dad saying to me. To my dad’s credit, he tried. We ate the same food, followed the same carb ratio and tried to work as a team to ‘defeat’ this nasty beast. However, what I didn’t know was after I’d go to sleep, dad would go and sneak a peanut butter sandwich. (Sneaky man he is.) In a 17 year olds brain, if your dad can’t do it, nobody can. That was my mindset. I tried to stay strong. I tried to keep up with the charity walks, and mentoring newly diagnosed diabetics, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking, “Damn, if dad can’t do this, superman can’t and if superman can’t, I damn sure can’t.” It became easier to bring that thought to the forefront of my brain, and my diabetes wellness on the backburner. It became easier to make up fictional number when my mom asked me what my blood sugar was then to take the work and go check it. Hell, it came easier to eat my lunch and go have a beer with the buddies, ignoring the fact that I need to take insulin. But why would I do all of these? For what, so I could live a couple years longer? Why did God deal all of this extra work to a kid who’s never really done any extra work? I could still go and socialize with my buddies. I could still go hang out in a parking lot until 3 a.m. and get up the next day and be totally fine, without dealing with my stupid diabetes. Why is my endocrinologist stressing to me to get things under control? He doesn’t understand! I’m living the life right now and I’ll be damned if I take time out of my day to tend to a disease that will affect me down the road. I’m living in the NOW! Boy, was that a mistake. 
   
   After so many years of ignoring my responsibilities I was dealt, I developed an arrogance with myself. Maybe I’m the exception, maybe my health isn’t as bad as everyone keeps saying. I mean, they don’t know me. They don’t know how I feel. I feel great, at least that’s what I kept telling myself. So what, maybe I do sleep until 11:30 in the morning, waking up feeling groggy and ready to go back to sleep. Yeah, so what if my body feels dehydrated, I still woke up today. Diabetes couldn’t touch me. I’m Brandon freakin’ Leasure. I’m better than this, I’m better than some stupid disease. Looking back, I became the person that I was raised to avoid. I became arrogant. Yeah, I’d still hold the door for the next person, or refer to everyone as ma’am or sir, I wasn’t arrogant towards other people. I was arrogant towards myself and that’s the most dangerous arrogance you can obtain. For these purposes, we’ll call the arrogance towards other people, “Social Arrogance,” and arrogance towards yourself, “Self Arrogance.” Just as a social arrogant person would do to their peers, I stuck my nose up to the signs my body was telling me. It’s like, if you’re arrogant to your peers, one of these days, you’re going to catch a right hook right to the chin. It’s the exact same if you’re a “Self-Arrogant.” Except, I didn’t catch a right hook to the chin, I caught a one way ticket to the bathroom floor in the ER vomiting so violently, I couldn’t move. 

   Wow, how did this happen. How in the hell did I, Brandon freakin’ Leasure, wind up here. I mean, I was the poster boy. Everyone on the outside would tell me how proud of me they were, how I took diabetes and, “Kicked its ass.” I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not supposed to be weak and vulnerable. At least, that’s what I told myself. To better understand the level of “self-arrogance” I had established, let me take you to the day my world came crashing down. It was a normal morning, I had gotten up, ate some cereal and was preparing to start my work for the day. (I worked from home.) But as I was setting up my day, I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t feel all too good and I knew a date to the toilet bowl was inevitable. Now, being an uncontrolled diabetic, puking was nothing to me. I figured I’d puke, feel better, and be a couple minutes late to logging in for work and all would be fine in the world. Except that’s not what happened. One puke turned into three, which turned into 4, which eventually ended up at 7 trips to the toilet bowl that morning. I couldn’t move. I worked up enough energy to climb back in bed and did what every boy does, I called my mom. Now after that phone call, I don’t remember much of anything, until I woke up on the floor of the ER Bathroom. Finally, I was taken into a room and immediately placed on fluids. To this point, I was good. Just another 3 day trip in the hospital and out I’d be ready to go back to my normal life. What I didn’t know, was this was the day my world would be flipped upside down. My parent’s had had enough of my way of living. They showed me tough love that day in the hospital and I earned my fair share of bedside lectures from my mom, dad and my fierce little grandmother. It was the talk I had with my grandmother, Mamaw as we call her, that really opened my eyes. She looked at me that day, and asked me the one question I wasn’t ready for. “Why?” Why was I in this hospital bed, what was so bad in my life that I ran away from all the responsibilities of my health to end up here. That one word, that one simple word, changed my life. 

   That day, I realized that Diabetes isn’t something you can just ignore and it will go away. If you ignore it too long, it will put you away. 

   The next few weeks entailed some crucial life changes that have helped me become the man I am today. I called off a wedding that was supposed to happen in 6 weeks. I decided to relinquish my rights to work from home, putting myself on a schedule. I removed all of the negative impacts that I had in my life the day I wound up on that bathroom floor. The beautiful thing is no matter how long it took me to acquire all of these negative influences, it took no time to remove them. Everything about my life is healthier now. I’m in a healthy relationship with a beautiful woman who doesn’t try to dictate my health, but encourages me to be the best diabetic I can be. With that beautiful woman came an eccentric two year old step daughter, who doesn’t see the diabetes, but sees a man who’s trying to be the best he can be, and she holds me accountable, whether she realizes it or not. I have an amazing relationship with my parents, better than I ever have before. But, the biggest thing that’s pulled me out of my Diabetic Burnout, is I’ve became what I like to call a, “First Responder Diabetic.” What I mean by that is, I no longer run away from my disease or the community that this disease has brought together, I want to run head first into it. 

   In closing, I’d just like to say this. You’re not alone. There is help out there, don’t be ashamed to use it. Don’t let your “Self-Arrogance” be the reason you end up on the bathroom floor in the local ER. You are valuable and you bring your own uniqueness to the table, don’t let a disease that is 100% manageable keep you from that. I think we all have a little, “Diabetic First Responder,” in us and we all can help each other with our everyday struggles. Diabetic Burnout is a pain in the ass, but I know you can dig yourself out of it, because I did.

New Meter + Software recommendations,"Hi folks,

For the past 12 years I've been using a OneTouch Ultra 2 for checking my blood sugars.  When I got it I ordered the funky usb cable that would allow me to connect it to my PC and download the readings to the OneTouch Diabetes Management Software so I could print out my log before visiting my doc.  The software also allowed me to export readings to a csv format which I then imported into a mysql db to do some of my own reporting with Micorosft Power BI.

My pharmacist finally convinced me to upgrade to a OneTouch Verio flex.  The Bluetooth connection to a phone is cool but I still want to be able to get the data into a database and the OneTouch software is no long being supported/developed anymore.  I've read somewhere that you can connect a micro usb cable to the meter and plug it into your computer but what software can be used to download the readings?

Help getting out of Omnipod contract,"Omnipod no longer works for me. I have a failure rate of around 1 in 3 pods. Most of the time the insulin leaks out of my body, and I get a spike. It's very stressful and I need to switch to something that has a better infusion set.

I don't know why this is happening. Insulet has not been helpful (to be fair, they have tried, but there's a real information vacuum at the company). I have tried new locations (same failures happen). I have tried pinching and not pinching. I've changed the orientation. Nothing I try seems to make much difference. This problem cropped up last year and has been getting steadily worse.

I renewed my contract with Insulet last year. It was a huge mistake. Now I'm saddled with this issue for three more years unless someone has some advice on how to get out of the contract, to return the omnipod system as defective or something like that.

"Partners of T1 Diabetes sufferers, what things (little or large) do you do to support your SO?","Little backstory for everyone, I matched with this amazing woman in December, we hit it off instantly and have been dating ever since, on our first date she explained that she was T1 and gave me a run down of what diabetes is and how it works, showed me her pump and everything she needed to do to manage her condition. 

I couldn't have asked for a more thorough and relevant explanation, it was clear that she had this thing down and didn't need my help one bit so I was comfortable to just date her like normal while giving consideration to things like where / when we ate and consulting her as much as possible so she had the opportunity to choose.

Needless to say I was pretty damn keen to keep seeing her because I felt a strong connection and so I started reading up on diabetes in order to be a better and more supportive friend and eventually partner.

Long story short we're together now and everything is going fantastically but I feel like there's more I could do / learn to support her and make her life easier. I discussed this with her and the possibility of making this post to find out what other partners do to support their SOs?

What we've come up with together (in case this helps anyone else) is the following:

- Be there to listen when she needs to talk or complain about diabetes

"Just switched to a pump, I have a few questions!","Hi there!



I just switched to a pump from doing multiple daily shots for 1.5 years.  I have a few questions for people more experienced!



1. How long does insulin last now that it's next to my body and at 98.6 degrees F?  When I was doing shots, I kept the pen I was actively using out of the fridge,  but it was at room temperature, not heated up by my body, so I just assumed it would last the usual 28 days, is that still true for insulin in a pump that's at 98.6?



2.  So you're supposed to change your canula and tubing every 3 days to avoid infections.  How serious is this?  Diabetes is full a lot of 'shoulds' but in reality people stretch things, like reusing needles multiple times, stretching Dexcom sensors beyond 7 days, etc.

Is this a yes, every 3 days on the dot, you should be changing both canula and tubing? Or can you get way with like 3-5 days for canula &amp; tubing?  What have people normally been doing? 



3.  Men, what's the best option for carrying the pump you've come up with?  Right now I've just been putting in my left  pocket, but tomorrow I have to change sites and switching pockets seems like a really big hassle.  (I usually have my keys in my left pocket and phone+wallet in my right, I'd rather not disrupt my habit I've had for 15+ years)



4.  Any other suggestions you'd have for someone who's new to the pump?

"""You're not Type 1, you must be Type 2""","Weird experience recently, wondering who else has run into this. I was at a large, very highly regarded academic medical center, home to my cardiologist, for a carotid ultrasound (carotids are OK, study was done to appease my nervous GP). Before starting some nurse took a history. When I said ""Type 1 diabetes since ...."" she said ""You mean Type 2."" I responded ""No, Type 1."" We went back and forth a few times until she said ""Did a doctor tell you that?"" (Keep in mind that she was sitting at a computer and had twenty years of my medical records at her fingertips.) At that point I told her and the other staffers that if they kept it up I'd get the thing done at &lt;competitor LVHRAMC on the other side of town&gt; and make sure my cardiologist knew why.

So that ended the discussion, but it left me wondering whether this is a common thing. Do nurses really think that there are people out there who don't know what disease they've got?

Once on a mountain drive, I started feeling low on the way home, tested and was 58, I reached in my lunch pale and realized I packed diet instead of regular, I was still about 20 min from the city, I started panicking and digging around while speeding and trying to maintain control of the vehicle, all while fighting the effects of a low, I found a single packet of sugar for coffee under my seat, I ate the entire thing and I made it to the store and grabbed soda, still feeling like shit but eventually got better. I believe that sugar packet was JUST enough to keep me steady till I got there. 

Last incident was with the pump, I have the Medtronic 670g. I was fairly new to the pump at the time and I was in a hurry, conversating, and I needed to change out the reservoir but didn't have time to change the tubing, I fucked up two things MAJOR, I left the tubing connected to my body and when i removed the empty reservoir I forgot to rewind the plunger so it was still all the way up. I filled the reservoir with 200 units of insulin and pushed it into the pump, it was hard to push in and I didn't think twice, it was because the plunger was up and as I was pushing in, I was pushing all the insuling outta the reservoir, through the tubing, and into my stomach. I only noticed because I got pain in my stomach. So I said wait a minute.. NOOOO... I pulled the reservoir out and sure enough, found out I injected myself with almost 200 units of insulin. I live right next to the hospital so I rushed there and they rushed me in the back, they blew some vains while trying to inject the D50 in a hurry, also struggled with my potassium levels crashing. It was a scary experience and painful. My sugar was about 32 for a couple hours, disgusting experience. Then I had to convince the Dr. it wasn't attempted suicide because he has never seen someone take that much. ",diabetes_t1,1552329845,Beeteez_,13,5,True,2019-03-11

Insurance tryna kill us?,"Hi all!! I want to start by saying how thankful I am for this sub, and apologize for this possible rant but I'm just kinda freaking out. 

So, I live in southern California and am on State insurance (Medi-cal). I put in for a refill for my lantus (basal insulin), and after not getting a confirmation for it being ready, I checked with the pharmacy and they said it is no longer covered by IEHP. I'm kind of shocked as I've been taking this insulin since I was diagnosed with diabetes about 14 years ago. I do not currently have an endocrinologist since the one they sent me to was a piece of shit. 

I'm mostly upset because insurance never bothered to contact me about this change, and also they tend to do this literally all the time. 

2 years ago I was accepted into UC Berkeley as a mathematics major. When I moved up there my insurance changed which meant they no longer covered the same insulins and it was just a huge pain to switch everything over and find a new doctor. Once I had an endocrinologist, things never seemed to get better. I got used to having to go to urgent care and even the hospital once just to get my insulin refilled. After having to go to the ER 4 different times, not all for insulin but other things regarding my shitty health as I didn't have proper insulin, I made the decision to move home to get my health back together. I had to give up on my dream of going to UC Berkeley and move home, which put me on a huge mental decline. I'm waiting to hear back from UCSD to see if I can attend there which is closer to home. 

It just sucks how making a life-changing decision to focus on my health actually didn't do so much. No matter what I do I feel like insurance just refuses to take care of diabetics. I feel like they'd rather not have to deal with us at all. Give us obstacles until we give up. Or possibly die.....I know I'm just being morbid but I truly feel sometimes like they're trying to kill me somehow but not allowing me to have insulin. 

Thanks for listening and any comments at all on this matter or diabetes in general are greatly appreciated. I love you all and thank you for making me feel less alone!! ❤️❤️❤️",diabetes_t1,1552336012,sweet_sunchild,20,20,True,2019-03-11
Dexcom G6 sensor not lasting full 10 days w/ Tandem insulin pump,"I recently made the switch to the Tandem insulin pump and have been using it as a receiver with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor since January. I LOVE the Tandem pump and the Dexcom CGM setup, but I have yet to have a sensor last for the full 10 days. I usually make it to day six or seven, and then the readings get really spotty. The pump will stop receiving any readings at all, followed by a sensor error message after about three hours. 

I've called both Tandem and Dexcom to resolve this issue, but neither company seems to have an answer. Tandem has sent me a replacement every time a sensor has failed, which is great, but I find it extremely frustrating that I've not had a single success since January.

Help a fellow T1 out! Chance to win a gift card!,"Hello! My name is Nicole Antoniadis, and I am a graduate student at Pacific University in Hillsboro, Oregon, USA. I am currently completing my dissertation on the effect of coping strategies on anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia (which is the omission or manipulation of insulin doses for the purpose of weight loss). This study aims to identify specific styles of coping which prove to be effective at decreasing the impact of anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia. These co-occurring problems can make recovery intensely difficult, so identifying more effective coping styles may lead to more successful treatment strategies.

If you are interested in taking part in this study, please follow the anonymous link below to the study survey. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to finish and it is voluntary and anonymous. There are no risks for participating in this study. You must be 18 or older, have type 1 diabetes, and have a history or current experience with diabulimia in order to participate. At the end you will be given the opportunity to enter a raffle for one of three $20 Amazon gift cards as a thank-you for your participation. You may also sign up to receive the results of the study once it is completed.

Just found out my son has T1. This sucks.,"So, 2 weeks ago the flu was making it's wonderful rounds in my home. We were all over it when it hit my 11 year old son. It hit him HARD. Weakness, fatigue, headaches, the whole bit. 3 days in, and no sign of reprieve, we decide to take him to urgent care. Nostril swab, flu confirmed. Prescription for tamiflu. ""All should clear up in a few days"". 

3 days later, he looks visibly emaciated. Super thirsty all the time. Too weak to walk. Have to hold him up to pee. Which was often. Now the puking starts. He can't keep even water down. We decide that he needs to go back cuz something ain't right. 

Waiting in the urgent care lobby, a nurse looks at him and they b-line to the back to check him over and then one nurse says something to the doctor, and about 10 nurses and 2 more doctors flood in. Proceed to shit pants. 

IV's everywhere. Fluids going in. In 3 days, he lost 8 lbs. Urine checked, HIGH ketones. He went into DKA. His A1C was 11.1, and glucose was 415. Scariest moment of my life. 

Moved to intensive care. Yay. Spend the next 7 days recovering, worrying, not sleeping, crying and punching hapless inanimate objects.

Afraid I could be facing early diabetic nephropathy,"Hi everyone, I'm a 27 year old female, and I was diagnosed with Type 1 26 years ago. My blood sugar control hasn't been fantastic, but it hasn't been terrible, either. My most recent HbA1C, on Feb 20 was 8.0%. I know it could be much, much better than that. I've been struggling a lot lately. But I also know it could be worse, and so for about a week, I wasn't *too* worried about it.

About a week after my HbA1c came back (Feb 27), I had to give a urine sample to test for albumin/creatinine ratio. Unfortunately, I did test a little high for that - 66 mcg/mg. The normal range is less than 30, but it's not considered severe unless it's over 300. Again, it was something that I know I need to work on, but I wasn't getting myself worked up over it.

The next day, I started to notice that I felt like I was urinating more frequently than usual. I don't know why, but I didn't initially do anything about it. I did start testing my BG a couple more times a day, and last weekend was particularly rough with highs (upper 200s to upper 300s). I ended up going to my university's health clinic last Wednesday (March 6) to get tested for a UTI due to the frequent urination. They did detect microscopic levels of blood, plus some white blood cells, so they gave me a prescription for Macrobid. I also asked for a pregnancy test (I'm on birth control, but I get paranoid), and fortunately that was negative.

Now, Macrobid has worked very well for me with past UTIs. Normally, my symptoms are gone within two days of starting Macrobid. However, I've been on it for 3 1/2 days now, and still feel the frequent urge to urinate. It hasn't burned at all. But I'm getting very anxious that my frequent urination, in combination with elevated urine albumin, means that I might be in early stages of diabetic nephropathy. I'm really terrified. I didn't think I could have been that close already. Like I said, my control hasn't been perfect, but I've never had an HbA1c higher than 8-ish, and I'm still relatively young. I had a checkup at the eye doctor last fall, and my eyes were in good health. I'm afraid that this is the beginning of the end of my kidney function. I have another doctor's appointment this Wednesday, but my anxiety over having a possible kidney problem (as well as simply having to urinate so frequently) is making it hard to focus on anything else.

Has anyone else gone through something similar, and ended up being fine?

I have some G4/5 Sensors that I will not be using.,"Been on the G6 for a couple months now. Just realized I still have these.

I would like to provide them to those in need. I would also like to have my co-pay back if possible.

So let's do this:

I am willing to give these away for a freewill donation of $40.00 for each box. That's $10.00 per sensor. 

I will choose the first four people who private message me to receive one box each. Include your PayPal email address. Once you have been chosen, I will send you a money request. Once the request has been sent, you will have 48 hours to respond. If there is no response, i will move on to the next user in line. I will pay the Paypal fees and the shipping. I can only ship within the continental US. 

About the photos:

As you can see, these are ""expired"". As we all know, this doesn't mean diddly, however I do not make any guarantees. These have been stored in a warm, dry closet in my bedroom since I received them. 

Also, the boxes have a bunch of black ink on the top of them. This is the result of my misguided attempt to use a paint pen to cover my personal information. It's ugly, but the insides of the boxes are not affected.

Today marks 30 years,"30 years. Not my 30th birthday to be clear. 30 years since it was confirmed that my pancreas kicked it. I was 3. I spent 10 days in the hospital with my parents while they took in all of the knowledge that is needed to live with diabetes. They did a good job. 

It would be a lie to say that I have done ""countless"" blood tests, injections, pump site changes and CGM insertions because I habe done the math. It's a lot. I don't like to dwell on it.

There have been many ups and downs in the last 30 years. Technology has improved (doesn't take 2 min to test my sugars anymore!) support is more available and communities like this exist so that we know, on the bad days, we are not alone. 

The bad days can be bad. You can try, try and try again and those sugars are still crap. Or the sensor kinked. Or the pump site came out. It is annoying, frustrating and some days down right depressing. But I'm still here and for that I am proud.

"I need help, having lows..........","My doctor recently suggested that I try following the low carb, high fat way of eating.  What she didn't touch upon was how to adjust the insulin rates.  Since starting this way of eating, I've had more really stubborn lows that don't seem to respond very fast to the typical remedies.  I have usually taken 15 carbs via glucose tablets and waited 15 min for bg to come up.  That isn't happening this time.  What am I doing wrong?

Experiences with Fiasp,"My doctor gave me a sample of Fiasp to try in my pump, and I'm not sure what to make of the results. Looking at my CGM for the past two nights, it looks like my blood sugars ""wiggle"" much more than when I used Humalog. That is, rather than a straight line overnight, it looks more like [https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-449fc97bb34a0a605632cf6fe0212d44](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-449fc97bb34a0a605632cf6fe0212d44)

The other thing is my blood glucose rises when I wake up, when it didn't on Humalog (even regardless of what time I woke up). It doesn't seem to make much sense, because I thought Fiasp is essentially NovoLog + vitamin B. I've used NovoLog before too, but I guess it was long enough ago that I'm not sure if I had a CGM or what the trend line looked like.

Sometimes the corrections did seem to happen more quickly, other times the correction didn't seem to have any effect. If you have experience using Fiasp in your pump, did you have to change your basal or bolus rates? Did you end up sticking with Fiasp or did you switch back to Humalog/NovoLog?

EdgePark Billing Sucks,"I wanted to share some advice to fellow victims that order supplies from EdgePark. I've been (stupidly) using EdgePark for almost 10 years, because at various times different insurance companies required me to order supplies from them.

So first, if you switch insurances, call any pharmacy besides EdgePark to have them check if they are contracted with your new insurance. There are probably a lot of third-party mail order pharmacies (if you have any to recommend, comment below!), or you can order directly from the manufacturer like Tandem or Dexcom.

Next, the way EdgePark billing works (maybe all mail-order pharmacies?) is that when you place and order, they check with your insurance company to estimate how much you will owe out-of-pocket. You are expected to pay this amount up-front, and only then will they process your order and submit a claim. Your insurance sends both you and EdgePark an explanation of benefits that states how much you owe EdgePark out-of-pocket, which is defined by the insurance company -- EdgePark isn't allowed to charge above that amount.

Unfortunately, it's not uncommon that EdgePark ""estimates"" your out-of-pocket cost to be much higher than what it actually is. When they receive the payment and explanation of benefits from your insurance company, **they** **DON'T AUTOMATICALLY REFUND YOU** if you overpaid. They also don't fix their estimate, so they **CONTINUE TO OVERBILL YOU**.

I just finished reviewing my orders for the past two years, and comparing them to the EOBs on my insurance companies website (which is a pain, because I've switched insurance plans during that time). **Turns out EdgePark owes me over $1000**! The billing person on the phone was helpful enough, and I got the impression she has dealt with this issue a million times because I only had to tell her ""I think I'm being overbilled, here are the order dates that seem suspicious"" and she quietly went to work, no discussion needed.

If your insurance requires you to order from EdgePark, then call the billing department and tell them you want to pay 0% of the copay upfront on each order. Then, **only after you get an EOB from your insurance company**, would you make a payment to EdgePark for the amount **your insurance company says you owe**. However, the billing person I spoke to said it's still possible that whoever takes your order will change the percentage back, and ask you to pay before shipping the order (ugh), and to ask them to transfer you to billing to put it back to 0%.

Now go check your payments and EOBs and get those refunds!",diabetes_t1,1551991281,zEUjgdWX,13,6,True,2019-03-07
A question for Type 1 Diabetics who drink alcohol,"Hi there! I’m a type 1 diabetic of a little over 7 years, and I turned 21 last year. I am in the process of making changes in how I live with and manage this condition because I haven’t been taking care of myself in the best way I can for a while now (my A1C hasn’t been under 10%) and I’m ready to change that. So, in trying to be more responsible while also knowing I’m a college student who wants to enjoy drinking with friends every once in a while without totally messing up the progress I’m making, I want to know if there is a more efficient way of drinking alcohol and taking insulin for the carbs in these drinks. Here are some questions I have:

1) How do you guys take insulin when you have alcohol? Obviously a lot of mixed drinks, beer, and wine have varying amount of carbs in them, but alcohol is also known to lower blood sugar. Do you take your full insulin dosage, or do you cut down on the units to account for that  lowering effect?

2) Are there drinks that you’ve noticed are “better” than others, as far as not causing too much of a noticeable blood sugar dip? 

3) Do you have a plan for testing your blood sugar more often when you do drink? If so, how much more do you do it than normal? 


Feel free to answer any of these questions or all of them! Thanks in advance :) 

BTW, I am on insulin pens (Levamir and Novalog) and I have a blood sugar meter, but at my next endocrinologist appointment I’m hoping to get put on some kind of CGM to make life a little easier. ",diabetes_t1,1551993597,xeizzil,29,7,True,2019-03-07

ODSP help?! Any success stories out there as a diabetic?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So I got my ODSP initial application declined because of not having a ""substantial mental or physical impairment that is recurring or continuous"". I have type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, PCOS, anxiety and depression. Though in isolation these may not cause too much of a problem, together they prevent me from taking full-time studies and I can not manage having a job at this time, nor do I foresee being able to uphold a ""full time"" job given my super low energy levels. 

My endocrinologist is almost impossible to get ahold of, my family doctor is on a hiatus and has different locums standing in for him so the person who wrote my internal review letter had never seen me before/doesnt know my issues well, and I havent seen a therapist in the last year because of being too busy and honestly trying to do some more things on my own (meditation, exercise, SAD lamps, free stuff on campus, etc). So I am worried that I wont have enough ""justification"" besides my own letter and a general letter from the new doctor I saw once that lists all my diseases/issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Just wondering if anyone has had success WITHOUT getting legal advice/help. Should I ask for more letters from my doctors? If so, can/should I ask them to really spell it out for the ODSP people? What kind of info should I put in my OWN letter justifying these conditions? Are there certain things I should really hash out for them? How dramatic basically should I be? Is it worth it or will they still turn it down because I dont have legal aid nor useful doctors notes.**

 I only have a week to submit my application to get an internal review. If need be, I suppose I could send it late.... but not preferred.

Any recommendations on how to adjust for the dawn effect?,"So about a month and a half ago I (finally!) got a CGM for the first time. I'm over the moon with how much data collection I'm getting with this CGM. I've always been a ""brittle"" diabetic, so the CGM is really helping to figure out the constant changes in how my body responds to all the lovely variables that affect our sugar levels. 

I'm on an insulin pump and recently did a basal assessment in the morning (from when I woke up to noon) and have found that I always seem to have a small spike in my sugars as soon as I wake up. However, as the time went on my sugars dropped back down slowly to a normal level. The spike isn't huge. I woke up around 6 mmol/L and rose to 11 mmol/L. By the time noon came around, I went back down to 4.6 mmol/L. I've also noticed this effect happening even if I happen to wake up in the middle of the night. As soon as I wake up, my sugars jump up by a few units.

My question is for experienced pumpers out there - how do you adjust for this? I'm trying really hard to refine my basal rate, so I'd love to know if you have any recommendations on how to handle this. I'm hesitant to just raise my morning basal considering without any influence of food/insulin, my sugars went down from that spike to just above the low threshold. Is it worth it to just have a 1 hour basal difference at the time I normally wake up during the week to adjust for this?

A Type 1 Diabetic's Rant,"We've all heard it before ""if you do this you can cure your diabetes"" ""you can eat that?"" and it TRULY gets to the point that you want to punch someone out. Before I was diagnosed; I even said it all, ""I could never do this or that"" but the sad fact of life is that we have no choice and if we don't, there are very bad consequences. I get so frustrated with people and how they just won't take what I say as the truth and the studies that they see are for Type 2 and how certain things will work for that. 

It's sad because I have said I have the ""bad"" type and to be clear I'm not trying to take anything from Type 2 but there is a stigma with how most cases people haven't taken care of themselves properly. It's those Type 2 that have never cared to take care of themselves to help with having Type 2. When people hear Diabetic they think that we have done it to ourselves and start judging us based solely on our condition. I work for GNC and in some way or another diabetes comes up. My CGM has gone off and I had to explain that to a customer or there is someone looking to help their's or a family member's type 2. I ask about their A1C, testing habits, eating habits ect. and that's when I get ""How do you know so much?"" 

We then get into a discussion and the good thing is that most of the time they want to be educated and understand what we go through everyday. It's not even just a work that I have issues with as I call them ""type 0s"" I've gotten the weird stares when I test at a store either because I'm calibrating my CGM or I feel low and feel that it's off for some reason. I love it when you catch people looking and they actually look guilty. I want to be clear that I'm not hating on anyone specifically or judging anyone this is completely to be therapeutic for myself and to keep me sane. 

Stand up if you have found yourself staring at the wall or your ceiling at one or two in the morning because you either A had to pee or B you just can't get to sleep because your numbers are acting up.

This pain can grow to be quite uncomfortable, and is only remedied by eating (even a single bite of something helps almost immediately).

Need some advice for my sister with t1 diabetes,"My sister is 15 and she’s been diagnosed for a while now, since she was 7 years old. Everything was going smoothly and she had a pump fitted a a few years back which made things easier for her and stabilised her blood sugar drastically.

She’s been within good ranges for a while now until about last November. Her blood sugar kept spiking up to the 300s almost everyday. Then last month, it started reaching 500-600 and has been in and out of Emergency and doctors multiple times a week. It’s so exhausting, and I’m so concerned and we don’t live in the same country, but I’m in constant contact with my mom and her.

The doctors struggled to understand what’s wrong. They took her off the pump to get things under control, increased her lantus, and her insulin, but it keeps spiking to dangerous highs everyday and takes ages to bring down. Sometimes it goes even higher after an insulin shot for no reason. 

We noticed a pattern of it spiking in school. she eventually told my mom that the girls in her class have been teasing her about missing school and being diabetic, which is awful. I have an understanding that it’s the stress and anxiety of school that’s been affecting her diabetes really badly.

Has anyone ever experienced such anxiety that it causes long term spikes in blood sugar? Does anyone have any advice on how I could help her?

Her doctors are a bit useless when it comes to psychological help and the wait times are so long. I’d like to get advice from people who have experienced something similar. I know being a teenager is hard, but with a chronic illness and missing school during a critical time is even more anxiety inducing.

Corrections for high BG just before going to sleep. Opinions?,"Being a heavy sleeper, I really hate the idea that I may possibly sleep all the way through a bad low, which is scary shit. For that reason I decided on a rule that I will not give myself any insulin less than 2.5 hours before bedtime, planning for my dinners accordingly. Usually it all works out reasonably well for me, but every once in a while something wouldn't go according to the plan, which makes me question my self-imposed rule.

For example, yesterday I was at 120 one hour before bed, but spiked almost all the way to 300 when I was about to sleep. Gotta love the pizza effect, huh. Anyway, surely I wouldn't go into DKA overnight, provided my basal insulin is well-adjusted and keeps working while I'm getting my sleep, but rocking such values for 7 hours also wasn't something I wanted to do. I ended up injecting half the insulin I would normally give myself for such BG, drank plenty of water, and just in case set an alarm to check again in 2 hours (which I of course slept through). As expected, in the morning I woke up at 200, with my mouth feeling like Sahara desert. Not fun.

At least I didn't risk getting too low, and managed to avoid waking up with even higher sugars and possibly feeling like total crap for the entire day, but I still can't shake off the thought that my course of action could've been better in some way.

I took my daily levemir down to 13 units as of tonight, I’ll see how this one works out for me tomorrow.

MiaoMiao - Horribly dissapointed,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Just a bit of ""buyer beware"" to all of you Freestyle users out there. I recently purchased a MiaoMiao adapter for my Freestyle sensor to hopefully use it as a CGM. Holy wow, what a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I received it last Wednesday and got it up and running fairly quickly despite some starting issues. It was mostly easy and straight forward despite the company provided LITERALLY no instruction on how to actually use the device. After reaching out to them for more information, I was simply sent an email that read (and please keep in mind, my original inquiry was for setup/connecting instructions): 

 

""Please stab the hole that back of miaomiao to reset it, when reset successfully you will see a red light flash.

If no red light , stab it and then try to charge it for 2-3hours to see if the green light is on or not

Remember to charge it after reset

If still not working, let us know""  


Ok, not a good sign. But I was able to get the unit setup and working, eventually. Once I got the hang of it, seemed easy.   


Several hours after getting it setup, it gave me a ""Checksum Failed"" error. After unpairing the device and deleting the Tomato app and reinstalling everything it worked again. Several hours later, failure again.  


I moved over to xDrip to give it a shot, maybe I would have more luck. Same deal. Every few hours checksum failed, except now it wont read the sensor at all. The sensor itself still works with NFC on my phone and the original hand unit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached out to the company for help, but I doubt I'll get any. The product Facebook page seems to have other people encountering this issue (with most people firing off a ""well you probably don't have it positioned correctly"" response). So now I'm out 300$ for a tiny piece of plastic that will do nothing but sit in a junk drawer until I inevitably throw it out when I can finally afford a real CGM.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I'm very disappointed with this product. I guess the old ad-age is true, if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is.

Could this be happening to me?,"I’m a diabetic for almost 15 years. Throughout the past year, every once in a while I will become extremely sensitive to insulin. This will last for a few days and then things will go back to normal.

For example, my normal insulin to carb ratio can be 1:10, but during these crazy sensitivity bouts I can become 1:50 or more. 

I am now going through the most insane bout yet. I am literally at a 1:75 ratio. It’s terrifying. The tiniest bit of insulin can slam my sugar down to 60mg. I am a heavyset guy, so it’s not like I am normally sensitive to insulin. A couple days ago my sugar began to drop rapidly from taking 4 units after eating plenty of carbs. I caught it at about 70mg and drank FOUR cups of OJ, and it still took 20 minutes for my sugar to stabilize. It was one of the worst hypo’s I have had in the 15 years I am diabetic. Sweating like crazy, lightheaded, shadows of light in my eyes etc.

This morning I had a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries. It’s at least 80 carbs. I took ONE unit of insulin. Again, that’s ONE unit, and I am sitting at 69mg.

I have tried searching what this phenomenon might be, and I have come across this:

http://sciencenordic.com/body-can-regain-ability-produce-insulin

That article states that the pancreas can technically produce insulin once in a while even in a type 1. I am wondering if these bouts I’ve been having might be related to this.

"Keto is great, but a word of caution","I was on a full keto diet for about 15 years prior to my diagnosis with Type 1.  So it's only natural that after picking up some winter weight this year, that I wanted to lose quickly, I checked back into Keto for type 1 diabetics. What I learned surprised, and scared me, and I found that I'm better off staying on a low carb diet and forgetting about Keto. This is why:

People with type 1 diabetes should not try to achieve ketosis through the ketogenic diet or otherwise. 
Because people with type 1 diabetes don't have insulin, they cannot metabolize ketones, which can result in an accumulation of ketone acids in their bloodstream known as diabetic ketoacidosis.
Persons with a healthy pancreas that can metabolize ketones, simply flush them out through urine.

Whereas ketosis is natural and harmless, diabetic ketoacidosis can be life-threatening if left untreated. 

Too much acid in the blood can poison the body, causing loss of consciousness and death. 

Ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type 1 diabetes, but it can sometimes develop in type 2 diabetes due to low insulin levels.

Ketoacidosis is rare in people without diabetes, but it might occur in cases of starvation. 

Diabetic ketoacidosis can develop quickly, sometimes within 24 hours. The condition is responsible for more than 130,000 admissions to the hospital, as well as 50,000 hospital days per year in the United States, according to an article published in the journal Diabetes Management. According to an article published in March 2013 in American Family Physician, diabetic ketoacidosis is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes who are under age 24.

If anyone has any arguments to the contrary, please post, as I'd like nothing better than to go on KETO.

Time to upgrade to a pump?,"Alright. So it’s currently quarter to 6 in the morning and I’ve been lying in the dark crying for a ridiculous amount of time - so bear with me, but...

Life’s kicking my ass. In almost any way that It can. (Car problems, money problems, lost my job, currently having to live with people who make life more difficult, dealing with Depression and more recently Anxiety, legal problems because of an car accident I was in, trying to deal with the trauma of said accident, etc etc etc) And more and more my diabetes gets put on the back burner as a problem we can just “deal with later”.  

I haven’t seen my doctor in a year (not that he would have helped much. I’ve wanted to get a new doctor for a real long time but have been terrified of doing so because I’m a creature of habit and safety), and while I’ve always been pretty good at taking care of myself without the help of a doctor, (because my home city had shit for diabetic care-learned most everything I know from a T1 Diabetic college professor who I happened to be taking classes from when I was diagnosed.) I can’t do it anymore. I’m not healthy. My levels are out of control. It’s very negatively effecting my life. It’s making me more hopeless in an already rough season of life. 

I’ve been using Novalog and Lantus pens since I was diagnosed in 2016, and like I said before, I’m a creature of habit and safety. So I never even let the idea of a pump cross my mind. But I’m getting to my wits end. I can’t keep up with any of this anymore. Pumps seem to be the standard anymore, and while they come with problems-obviously-they seem in general to be easier than dealing with the pens from what I gather from posts I see? 

I guess what I’m looking for from y’all:

1-A little encouragement. I feel like I’m letting myself fall apart and like my body is just wasting away while I sit here and watch it. I’m sure others have felt this way at some point in their journey, and I guess I just want to know that there’s still hope.

2-Pump advice/suggestions. I know literally nothing about them because my young stubborn ass wouldn’t even let my mom or doctor bring up the idea (I was stupid, I know. Live and learn). 

Like I mentioned I’ve recently lost my job-partially because my blood sugar is currently so out of control that I get sick quite often. So all I’m doing with my life right now is sitting around and playing video games. And I’m sick of it. I’m sick of everything. So I’m just hoping this will help jump start me on taking a more proactive approach to my health and managing my diabetes. My goal is to make an appointment with a (new) Doctor tomorrow. Hopefully someone who actually has experience with diabetes and can actually help me. 

I’m so sick of being sick. 

I suppose I should add. I know getting a pump isn’t going to just magically fix everything, but I do feel like it’s a step in the right direction. ",diabetes_t1,1551269869,LostDontFindMe,6,3,True,2019-02-27

Wanted to give a quick shoutout to the VA,"Decently long post...  


Veteran's Affairs of all places! After being diagnoised at the ripe old age of 24 with T1 while in the Army, the DoD/Tricare was actually awesome (not counting my initial doctor telling me erroniously that I probably had T2 due to my age). Let me choose my own pump from a selection of reps after a few months on injections, and ended up getting the 530g, mostly because the rep was prior military who got out after being diagnoised.  


Once I was out I was transferred to the VA endocrinologist for care in KY.... That was not great to say the least, every appointment felt like a quick, I see you, you are testing, lets make some adjustments to your pump and get you out (something easily done by myself via email lol). This past summer I moved back to my hometown and was transferred to the VA in Phoenix. Needless to say, after the wonderful press this particular hospital has been getting I wasn't expecting much, and I was right. I wasn't testing as often as I should have during the move, and my A1C went up to about 8 from 7 on my previous labs (I had stopped using the Enlite because my wife was going to strangle me with the number of false low alarms I was getting at night).  


So, they threatend to stop my pump and put me back on injections if I didn't get everything in check. Took me a while, and while I'm still not perfect with the testing, especially on weekends, I have been making some gains thankfully. I also started looking for a private endo because I did not feel comfortable at the VA, and I didn't appreciate the threat of taking me off the pump instead of trying to help me. The incomplete testing data wasn't making me feel good about my followup appointment, so I ordered as many pump supplies the system would let me before they were discontinued. I refound my Enlite sensor (lost after the move) and put it back in. Weathered some whither stares from my now 8 month pregnant wife in doing so.  


Fast forward to yesterday, my second appointment (originally scheduled for the end of December...) the prior endo had moved I guess and I got seen by a new one. She took one look at my issues with testing, saw the still horrifically inaccurate) Enlite sensor data for the past 6 days and told me she is putting me on the Tslim X2 and a Dexcom G6. Surprised, I asked why and she simply mouthed ""because it SUCKS"" to me haha. Couldn't agree more.

Depression is affecting my diabetes.,"Hi. I’m a 25 year old woman from the UK and I’ve fought with my mental health since about 2014. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and am on medication for depression and anxiety. It got so bad at one point that I couldn’t leave my house, not even to go in the back garden. Home was my safe place and I felt like the outside world was a bad place where bad things would happen to me.  I would lie in bed all day, staring at the walls, I put on two stone over about two years after I quit my job because I hated it and had no motivation to do anything. I was suicidal many times and at one point took a handful of lorazepam, not so much as a suicide attempt, just because I felt so overwhelmed and in such a frenzy that I just wanted it all to stop.

Fast forward to this time last year and I found a new job and loved it. I’m working in a school and the children there just make me so happy and I love each and every one of them and want to help every one of them succeed and be happy. A few months into my new job, I went on a date and long story short, was raped. I still have a lot of feelings of guilt and shame about it, I blame myself for various reasons and often feel bad for referring to it as rape sometimes because I feel like I should have done more to stop it than I did, rather than just letting him do it as well as the fact that I was too naive and trusting and feel like an absolute idiot for that. 

I’m struggling now. I have been since before Christmas but it’s just getting worse and worse. I’m a type one diabetic and I have nearly ended up in DKA (which can kill you) three times because I’ve just stopped caring. I feel like I’m not actively suicidal but I don’t like life. I wouldn’t jump in front of a bus but I wouldn’t jump out of the way of one. I used to self harm by cutting and I feel like now I’m self harming but instead of using a blade, I’m self harming by neglecting my diabetes and making myself potentially life threateningly sick. 

My brother knows I was raped. He is amazing but he is in a bad place himself at the moment and I don’t want to add to it - he is the best human being I’ll ever know and he’s been there for me more times than I can remember. Just once I want to do the same for him. My mum is sick herself and doesn’t know I was raped - I felt like it would destroy her and make her feel like she’d failed to protect me in some way even though that’s far from the truth. She’s a brilliant mum.

Sometimes I scare myself with how I feel. Sometimes I just sit and think about how long it would take for me to go into a coma if I stop taking my insulin. Once I’ve acted on it but something changed my mind. Sometimes I wonder about taking a bunch of pills and not waking up in the morning. I often think about walking around my neighbourhood late at night, hoping something would happen to end it. 

I’m so angry at the man who did this to me. Right as I was getting my life back on track he fucked it all up for me. 

The longer I leave it, the more disturbing symptoms I’m seeing - I’ve starting to see things - mostly huge spiders for some reason? Sometimes I feel as if there are insects crawling all along my skin but there’s nothing there. When I’m in the shower I scrub my private areas so hard it’s sore and red and raw and bleeds because it feels disgusting to know what he did. I feel hopeless. I feel scared. I feel out of control and I’m worried that one day maybe soon I’m just going to give up for good because I don’t know how much longer I can take it. 

I should say I’m on a waiting list for counselling. I tried to reach out to my dietician about all of this but as kind as she was she didn’t really seem to get it. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to be happy again. I loved that brief period of happiness and fulfilment and hopefulness about the future. I want that back but I have no idea how to get there. 

TLDR; was raped, depression has got really bad again, to the point where I’ve made myself seriously ill and been in hospital because I’m neglecting my health condition (type 1 diabetes). ",diabetes_t1,1551201575,throwawayacc615,5,24,True,2019-02-26

Thinking about a new pump...,"I'm having a lot of problems with my Omnipod system. I've been using this system for quite some time, but starting last year, I've been having more and more delivery issues related to the insulin coming back out of the cannula insertion point. It's frustrating.

I had a failure on Sat night after 2.5 days and Sun night after only 1 day.

I can't keep this up. My BG is getting out of whack and I feel like crap.

I've found that the only options other than omnipod are the TSlim and Medtronic pumps.

Can you guys make recommendations, or post your experiences with your pods?

I'm wondering if I'd do better with pens...

I had a meltdown today.,I’m 20f and I was just diagnosed on March 24th of last year. I had a lot of issues after I was diagnosed and I was really sick for 3ish month due to undiagnosed Gastroparesis and Insulin Neuritis. It’s been really hard.

BGS way higher than normal with regular injections,"I have been dealing with this all day at work and have made no progress. I ate my usual morning breakfast burrito and crackers with PB. Then ate exactly what I ate all last week without issues, lasagna, yogurt, and apple. Morning injection didn't seem to do much so I took 2 more units. Then at lunch took a larger bolus than usual. Then have been giving 2-3 extra units per hour after nothing has happened.

Any ideas as to what could have happened? I gave myself the same amount of basal as I usually do 19 units. And used my sliding scale of 15 carbs/1 unit to bolus. Could my insulin have gone bad?

Is Medtronic Doing Another Transmitter Replacement/Recall?,A few months ago I kept having the “BG Required” alert problem. After several calls in a couple of weeks Medtronic finally stopped sending me replacement sensors and told me they had a new transmitter and they were sending out replacements to people who were experiencing this issue. Well flash forward to now and the recurring problem I keep experiencing is that my sensor tells me my blood sugar is crashing and below 40 and when I check it on my meter it is at a normal number. Then my sensor either rejects my calibration and tells me to replace the sensor or accepts the calibration and displays my blood sugar as crashing a few minutes later.

High insulin needs?,"So, after diagnosis, I was kept at high BG levels (12-16 mmol/L) to avoid oedemas in my eyes from quickly dropping HbA1c, a complication apparently common among people with narrower visual nerves than the baseline population. I was recently allowed to return to normal levels as my visual nerves were found to be normal. My BG has dropped, but not fully to normal levels, and I currently hover around 11-13 as opposed to 14-15. Immediately after diagnosis, my I:C ratio was something like 1:21 or so, which is probably in part from my kidneys working to reduce BG and perhaps also from the severe weight loss I experienced (I presented with DKA and a weight loss of 14 kg over the previous few days).

Now my I:C ratio seems to be something like 1:8, which I understand is kind of unusual, and since my weight is still on the low side and my BG is still on the high side, I anticipate it might drop a bit further. Does this drastic a change indicate that I am developing insulin resistance and should be worried?

Pancreas’s transplant.,"Hi, I made a post last year about my wife being on the transplant list for a pancreas due to erratic type 1 diabetes, that was being controlled with a pump. In June of last year she had the transplant and now almost 8 months later she is doing great.  The only way to describe it really is since that Saturday morning when she had it done she hasn’t had a high or low or anywhere near one. 

There was a second operation on the Tuesday following the operation due to air bubbles around the new pancreas but after that she was home ( albeit very tender) on the Friday night. 

She is back at work now and has just started going to the gym to train for a charity walk early next year. 

If anyone had any questions regarding the surgery or recovery I can try and answer them. 

There is a second surgery where she will have the new pancreas grafted to her gut but this is on the back burner as she hasn’t had any bladder problems.

Just a FYI, the last time I did this I had a few people said “this doesn’t happen without the a kidney transplant as well”. I am fully aware of this. 

Also there was a few people who wondered why my wife had decided to take such a let’s say drastic procedure. All I can say is this is what she wanted to  do mainly for a better quality of life.

Type 1.5 and mental fog. Asking for advice!,"Hi all,
I've been diagnosed for a couple of years now and suspect that I have 1.5 (though the doctor has never said that), given test results. To get to the point, I am tired of constantly feeling like I'm not ""fully present,"" as if I'm cognitively lagging behind due to fatigue. I shouldn't say constantly, but only on rare occasions do I fully feel in control and lucid. 

I would feel somewhat comforted with hard data, such as a PET scan confirming a lack of metabolic activity - or something of the sort! - but, ultimately, am looking for relief from these symptoms. Doc doesn't really care as long as my a1c is good.

Is there anything I can even do? I'm on metformin and short-acting insulin. Post-bolus usually rises to 170-180mg/dL with ~40carbs and 2u insulin, or 70carbs with 3u. Then it drops, which I treat with glucose tabs. There are short windows within the 4 hours the insulin is active in my system that I actually feel okay, and I'm finally fed up enough to make this post.

12 year old daughter all of the sudden requiring more than double normal insulin,"I have a 12 year old daughter. She was diagnosed 4.5 years ago. She uses a Dexcom G6 and Omnipod. She is currently using Humalog. Her basal is normally around .7 units per hour and her insulin to carb ratio is usually 1 to 12. A 1 unit correction will normally reduce her blood sugar by about 50 points. She usually has a sub 7 A1C and I thing we do a good job overall of handling things.  For the last 3 days, it seems like no amount of insulin will drop her blood sugar. For the last 3 nights, I have given 15-20 units of correction throughout the night. I've never had to do anything like that before. We have already given 40 units of correction today, and she has been over 300 most of the day. I normally adjust her basal in increments of .05, and it has a significant effect. Today, we are now up to 1.6 (was at .07 three days ago) for her basal, and her I/C ration is now 1/5. She is still climbing, but much slower. I do not know of anything out of the ordinary going on. She is eating normal and has normal activity. She doesn't appear to be sick in any way. I know I could call her endo, but I feel like this is something that I would rather ask someone else that has T1D. She has replaced her pump and I have no reason to believe the insulin has gone bad. It hasn't been exposed to heat and her vials last less than 30 days. Does anyone have any suggestions? Should I just keep increasing until I find the right ratios?
