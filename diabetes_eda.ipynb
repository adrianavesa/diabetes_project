For those of us with a history of severe hypoglycemia or other issues and who are on the Dexcom to begin with in order to *stay alive*, this results in having to run high for days every single cycle while you wait for the new order to arrive, plus the senseless stress of not knowing if or when that will occur.   \\n\\nWhat the heck Byram and UHC (and Dexcom if you have a role here)?

At first I thought that drinking a soda would help because it usually does, but about twenty minutes later and my blood sugar is going down again. Now I’m practically stuffing myself with sugar, feeling sick to my stomach, with no luck so far in at least making things normal. I’m not really here for guidance, I guess I just want to rant to people who get it. So thanks for taking the time to read this if you did. I appreciate you and I hope things are going well for you :)',\n",

Lately it's been a little off and I've corrected by a unit or so in the night a few times this past week. Last night, I was rising slightly (85-105 I'm an hour) without eating more after supper so I thought ok some slower digestion the meal had high fiber and a fair amount of protein. I took 2u short acting and my usual night dose of levemir. Went to sleep 104. I woke up 2 hours later at 177 and rising, took 4u short acting and added 5u of levemir thinking my needle maybe malfunctioned and I didn't get the dose earlier. Woke up again a few hours later, sugar had gone down and then was back to 125 and rising so I took 4 more units of short acting. I woke up at 89. Has this ever happened to anyone? Am I about to get sick? Did I just get off the plane and arrive back in reality after a really lovely honeymoon? (4.5 yrs ago diagnosed) I don't even know how to adjust from this.\",\n",

WARNING TALK OF MISCARRIAGEHi, I’m a 20 female.i was diagnosed with type 1 a little under two years ago. \\n\\nI had gallstones during my pregnancy that caused many complications for me. I spend 7 months in Hospital after my son was born and lost my pancreas in the process. \\n\\nIn the middle of last year, I fell pregnant. It wasn’t planned. Two days after the blood test got confirmed (I had only taken a at home test before that and the lines were very faint) I had a miscarriage. \\n\\nAlthough my partner and I were devastated it was easier to accept as we weren’t planning and we’ve have already had our fair share of devastating news in the last year or so. \\n\\nAfter all that trauma had passed, we seriously talked about expanding our family. We originally wanted at least 4 kids but I honestly struggle with my sugar so we knew that wasn’t going to happen. \\n\\nAfter talking we decided to have one more kid, regardless of gender, and we’d stop. I want to get my tubes tied after our last kid as to not experience anymore unwanted pregnancy as the doctor said they’d all most likely end in miscarriages. \\n\\nI started to work with my doctor, a diabetes nurse and a dietician to work towards a healthy pregnancy. My sugar has improved so much but it’s nowhere near perfect and we’ve had to push make the ‘conceiving’ date twice now..\\n\\nSo, one with the actually post...\\n\\nMy last period was in November. I’ve missed 3 periods now. \\n\\nI’ve taken 3 at home test, all spanned out over the months and all of them negative. \\n\\nI wasn’t worried at first because my period had been unreliable in the past, I thought that perhaps that cycle was starting again. \\n\\nAfter the third month hit, I got worried and went to my doctor for a blood test. \\n\\nI got the results back today. She said they were inconclusive. \\n\\nI’m not a medical expert so sorry for this bad explanation... \\n\\nShe said if the human grow hormone (I think that’s what it’s called?) is below 5 you’re not pregnant and if it’s above 25 you are pregnant. Mine was 10. \\n\\nShe said, it could be too early to tell and to come back for another blood test in two weeks. \\n\\nI was very angry (?) and confused. I was sure that I definitely wasn’t in the early stages of pregnancy because my period has been late for around 6 weeks so IF I was pregnant I should be further along then that. \\n\\nMy instant conclusion was that I must have fell pregnant late last year and had miscarriage and I didn’t bleed so I might get I’ll etc etc. it was a moment of panic since my first miscarriage was traumatic and I really wasn’t thinking straight. \\n\\nLater that day, tonight, I thought about what my doctor said and the logic of it all. If I did have a miscarriage last year there wouldn’t be any traces of the hormone left would there? \\n\\nI was confused and upset. \\n\\nI couldn’t wait two more weeks to find out, Especially since I’ve had two semi low sugars for my readings. My sugar is supposed to be between 4-10. My sugars were all 4.3 and 4 which make me start to shake and feel sick. \\n\\n\\n I took a at home kit again, basically to prove to myself that it was nothing and shake the anxiety... \\n\\nIt came up positive right away, not even the weird very faint line that happened during the miscarriage, it looked normally.\\n\\n(This is important to me because my doctor said that the faint line would have been because there wasn’t enough of the hormone in my system to detect. That my sugar levels would have caused an early development defect in the embryo and it wouldn’t have formed correctly, so it stopping growing and produced the hormone.) \\n\\n\\nSo I figured that if the results from the test I did a few days ago said my levels a low but they were higher enough to appear on a at home test then perhaps I am pregnant and there may be a chance of a successful pregnancy. \\n\\nI’ve been told by almost all the medical experts in my life that the best way to achieve a healthy pregnancy and baby is to have perfect sugar not only during the pregnancy but while you conceive and the first few weeks. \\n\\nIt basically lays down a perfect foundation for the embryo to form upon. I’m sure my sugar levels haven’t been the best...  No major lows but a few highs. My highest level is supposed to be 10, I’ve had 15-17. \\n\\nHas anyone had a similar problem? Not the best levels during the start but had a healthy baby? Thanks.',\n",

I’ve been type 1 for about a year and a half, and before I was diagnosed, I had two bowls of Cheerios with *maple syrup* every morning (I know it sounds gross but I love it). When I was diagnosed, I thought for sure I would have to give it up, but it being my favorite breakfast, I thought I would figure it out. Although it’s not exact science and takes A LOT of experimenting, I’ve figured out some benchmark tips in eating cereal with sugar...\\n\\n1. Bolus and wait a long time before eating. I use an Omnipod, and what works for me typically is bolusing the moment I wake up and I let all the insulin go in before I even get the milk out.\\n\\n2. If you’re determined to do this, you’re gonna have to up your morning carb ratio by a lot to prevent high blood sugars. If you buy insulin out of pocket this might not be the best diet for you.\\n\\nWith these general tips I’ve been able to eat 2 bowls with Cheerios with syrup every morning since diagnosis. By the time I had perfected this diet, I had an A1C of 7. Although it’s difficult and risky, if it’s worth it to you same way it was to me it might just be worth it.\\n\\nHope this helps!',\n",

The pump will have no screen, wireless control from a phone/handheld, and a variety of infusion set options. Users will be able to wear the t:sport pump like a patch directly on the body under clothes (very short infusion set) or in a pocket like a traditional tubed pump (longer infusion set). t:sport will be about half the size of the current t:slim X2, is expected to hold 200 units of insulin, and will include an on-pump bolus button – e.g., a bolus can be taken even if the handheld is out of range. t:sport will integrate the Control-IQ hybrid closed loop algorithm discussed above and receive data from Dexcom CGM, allowing for a truly on-body closed-loop system – i.e., users will remain in automated insulin delivery even when the phone/handheld is out of range.

Our mother died around the same time. cancer. He did well through school, but when he got into the world on his own didn't do so well. Lots of seizures from lows. In the last three years, he's been in the hospital with ketoacidosis. Each time, its been during the off season from a union carpentry apprenticeship. As soon as unemployment kicked in, the drinking would follow suit. Any time he was working though, he seemed fine. \\n\\nLast winter, when it happened again, I flew out and in the month I stayed afterwards talked a lot about an option to move out here. No down season at work. The opportunity sold him. He was sober for a few more weeks after I left to come home. When I went help him move out (and in with me), it was bad again. Had a hard talk about not drinking and seeking help. He's been insistent about not being an alcoholic. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, cause i know he struggles with being diabetic. I think it's the stigma of another disease. Couple months went well, now its back to the same. \\n\\nHe's been making progress. Got a CGM, found a physician, even made an appointment to see a therapist that specializes in the area. In the meantime though, the drinkings accelerating with pot added to the equation. its 4-6 beers every night. No real meals or dinner. Every time I hear a beer crack open, its like a little knife taking a cut out of me.\\n\\nI'm trying to engage with him positively. Ask him about what he wants to change and how I can help. He's shared as much that he drinks to cope. The psy type people tell me to share how the drinking affects me, to share emotion, but that doesn't work. It just gets a tough guy response.. To be honest, its a hard thing to manage. Just so much emotion wrapped up in it. \\n\\nIf anyone here has been through this, or is struggling with this and can offer me any advice or perspective on how to be the right kind of support.

       " \"Frequent colds causing non-stop high blood sugars, with ketones, how to manage in a preschooler?So my 3.5 year old son (T1D for 2y) has been sick A LOT since starting preschool in September.  There is usually several days of his cold where his blood sugar is non-stop high and when we check his ketones they are elevated (typical sick morning check: 20.0BS and 1.5blood ketones).  \\n\\nNow we received a 'how to' book from our diabetes team when he was first diagnosed and have been following that for over a year an a half.  Then when we went to his appointment in December 2019 we learned that the information in the book is for urine ketones, but we exclusively check blood ketones, so we have been majorly under correcting for his illness-related insulin resistance.  This appointment was also with a new doctor to the local team and she said that you give insulin for food PLUS 5% TDD (10% for moderate, 15% for high) for insulin resistance PLUS insulin for the high blood sugar.  Which seemed like a lot, but made sense at the time.\\n\\nThen last week my son is sick AGAIN, his blood sugar is 17.7 upon waking, so I pull out the ketone reader, check him and his ketones at 4.6(!). That is double the highest I have ever seen. So I call the on-call endocrinologist, who is different than the new one from December.  Explain that situation and that if I gave my son the high BS correction AND the 15%TDD, those numbers would be more than the amount of insulin for his carbs, which seemed way to high (1.5forBK+1.0forBS +2.0forCarbs).  He agreed it was too high and said that the correction for BS and BK don't stack, you defer to the % of TDD. \\n\\nSo now I am confused.  I understand the 5%10%15% rule and since my son's total daily does is about 10units the math is easy. But do I give insulin for his food, blood sugar level and extra for ketones?  Also if you have any other tips for illness-related insulin resistance/ dealing with ketones, that would be great.  We just got a CGM so we are trying to improve his overall blood sugar pattern, but it is hard to get enough days of data to tweak things, if his is sick 1 of 4 weeks each month, with crazy highs that we can't get down.\",\n",

       " \"T1D and Allergic to Insulin ☹I was diagnosed three years ago, at the age of 47. Of course, because of my age, I was initially diagnosed as Type 2, but because metformin didn't bring my sugars down AT ALL and because I have other autoimmune diagnoses, I suspected I was actually Type 1. (I hadn't heard of LADA at that point. ) It WAS LADA but I had a short honeymoon period, so now I am effectively living with Type 1. Anyway, six months ago, I began having allergic reactions at my infusion site. My endocrinologist switched me from Humalog to Apidra, but I continued to have itching, rashes and burning pain at the infusion site. We then tried switching my site every two days instead of every three, on the theory that I might be allergic to the Teflon on the plastic cannula of the Omnipod. When I was wearing it for 72 hours, the first day would be totally comfortable, the second day would be distractingly itchy, and the third day would be such burning pain (like getting constantly stung by wasps!) that I would always end up pulling the site out early. So wearing the Omnipod for 48 hours was better (one good day,  one itchy day, no painful days) but still not great (spending 50% of my life with crazy-making levels of itchiness). We tried a different pump (Medtronic) and various infusion sets, but no improvement, so I went back to my Dexcom CGM and my Omnipod, because I like those better than the Medtronic CGM and pump. Then, a few weeks ago, my endocrinologist decided to try me on Novolog AND LO AND BEHOLD ALL THE ITCHINESS AND PAIN WENT AWAY! I can wear an Omnipod for 72 hours, no problem! I need less insulin because there's no swelling around infusion site to interfere with absorption.  \\n\\nSo now I am trying to count my blessings: I have insurance that has allowed me to try a couple of different pumps and CGMS, I have an understanding partner, I have decent communication with my endocrinologist. But I am also feeling scared, because if I developed allergies to two different brands of rapid-acting insulin in just 30 months of using insulin...maybe I am going to develop an allergy to Novolog, too? And I am TRYING not to borrow worries from the future and just focus on what's in my control TODAY, but it's frightening. I carry an EpiPen along with my Glucagon, just in case, but honestly,  diabetes is challenging enough to live with already,  without adding in allergic reactions to insulin on top of all the other challenges.\\n\\nThank you for letting me vent.

To clarify: The AI would keep in mind the amount of insulin your using from the smart pen and would learn to adjust over time.\\n\\nAdditional Ideas: It could suggest foods that don't work well with you, or keep in mind your dieting preferences. It could have a satiety option and suggest meals you've had in the past that make you full yet don't raise your BG. It could optimize for micronutrients in food as well and tell you what you're lacking in.\\n\\nWhat's the closest to that there now is? What are the options in Canada?\\n\\nBTW: the reason I'm going for the Libre and not Dexcom is it seems to last a bit longer (14 vs. 10 days) and it doesn't seem as intrusive (a bit smaller) and it seems a bit more convenient.\\n\\nThanks a lot!\",\n",

So, I’m not sure if these symptoms could be related to that or if I should be concerned about T1D. \\n\\nI’m obviously not asking for a diagnosis, but I’m wondering how long between symptoms and diagnosis it was for you or your child. Basically, how bad/dangerous would it be if I waited a bit to see if these symptoms go away (and therefore would suggest that it was just the mono). I don’t want to take an unnecessary trip to the ER if I don’t need to, but I know untreated T1D can be life threatening. \\n\\nThanks for all your help',\n",

He\\'s had some more issues than usual in the last year(diabetic retinopathy, an unresolved stomach issue), so it feels like we always have an upcoming doctor\\'s appointment. \\n\\nHe started seeing a new PCP last year. He explained that he needed constant referrals and asked if it would be necessary for him to come in every time to get them. The doctor assured him he had no problem writing referrals for doctors my boyfriend had already seen. He could just call the office and they would send them over. While the office wasn\\'t always the best at sending the referrals on time, they eventually got there. Everything was good.\\n\\nRecently, the doctor started a new policy that you have to come in for an appointment to get ANY referral.

The doctor wasn\\'t even there; he saw the physician\\'s assistant. \\n\\nThis week, he needed a referral to see his dietician.

He called and tried to explain to the receptionist he\\'s already seen this dietician, and he couldn\\'t get time off of work for an appointment. The office stuck to the policy and told him he had to make an appointment (and then mentioned that the doctor was about to leave for a three-week vacation).

He’s not on insulin yet but typically his numbers run higher, in the pre-diabetic range. We’ve changed some eating habits so we attributed it to that.

Last night almost 3 hours after his dinner, his CGM said 140. He double checked with his accu-check and it said something like 170. An hour later he was at 120s from CGM and 150s from the finger stick. Is this normal?? Now he’s doubting that the CGM has even been right at all and he’s been higher than what we thought this whole time. Is it typical they can be that far apart?

This was not, repeat, not, a compression low.  I watched as the CGM reported me dipping from 160 to 85 over the course of the next half hour (after waking up).  I confirmed with a finger stick that I was actually 170 (twice). \\n\\nWhat I did next I confirmed with customer support was the correct thing to do.\\n\\nI calibrated.\\n\\nIt buzzed and told me to test again. I did so and recalibrated.\\n\\nWithin a couple minutes, the rise to 160 began on the pump.  But it didn't do it all at once.  It did it gradually over 20 minutes.   Which meant that the Control IQ software kicked down the door and wanted to do something about this sudden onslaught of blood sugar.  It kicked in 2.5 units...  Um...\\n\\nSo I suspended basal and waited an hour.  I confirmed my sugar was down to 133 with a finger stick and lined up with the CGM readings.  Still had a ton on board though.  It ended up that the Basal IQ portion kicked in and shut off my basal for a while.  \\n\\nThis was not a relaxing experience.\\n\\nFast forward to today.  I changed the sensor last night (it was getting flakey in the evening).  This morning there was an actual compression low.  Even though I was in suspend mode, I was actually 170.  I waited for it to raise back up, after it did I was starting to go about my morning and was about to go do some cardio.  Figured that would knock me down to the 120-130 range.  But then super CONTROL IQ kicked down the door again and slammed me with 2 units.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not work out and I ended up going low.\\n\\nSO...  IN THE FUTURE...  \\n\\nAny time I get a calibration mismatch or a compression low, I am going to bolus for one hours worth of basal insulin and then suspend my pump for one hour.  By then, whatever recalibration shenanigans should be over and I won't have to worry about it correcting an artificial rapid BG change.\\n\\nIt should also be worth noting that I had zero issues prior to this one experience.  This may be a rare occurrence.  But if it happens to you, maybe what I'm trying will work for you.\\n\\nI'll report here if it happens again.  Also, I'll report it to customer service as well.\\n\\nHas anyone else had anything weird happen?\",\n",

And here\\'s a boat to represent carbs.\"\\n\\nAfter about 20 minutes of this I politely tried to tell her that I\\'ve been at this for a couple decades and also got my degree in biology and she cut me off, saying \"I just like to go over the basics every time I see a new patient.\" Then she paused and added a few extra \"scientific terms\" to the drawings for me.

She literally gasped and clutched her chest. \"You eat 100 grams of CARBS per day?!\" I am fairly certain I saw her write NON-COMPLIANT on my chart.\\n\\nI cried in the parking lot after that appointment, then I got mad, and finally burned out.

       " 'LibreLink App for Libre 2: Alarms not working with Sony Xperia XZ3At long last the Libre 2 was made available in Norway - not for everyone, but for hand-picked DM I patients like me. I had the Libre 1 before (I had to order things from Abbot and pay for myself), and it was good.\\n\\nHowever, the Libre 2 is a relevation. I LOVE the hypoglucemia alarms - when they work.\\n\\nThe problem: When you put on the sensor, you can choose to activate the sensor with the standalone reader or with the LibreLink App. After this the sensor is paired to the device that activated it for the life of the sensor, which is exactly 2 weeks. (You can still read the sensor with the LibreLink app, but the alarms will go to the reader. I do not remember if you are allowed to switch the mobile phone to get alarms. If you activate with the App, the reader won\\'t work.) \\n\\nI do not want to lug around a hardware store at all times, so I opted for the LibreLink App on my Sony Xperia XZ3. Also, I want to receive alarms discreetly on my Wear OS watch, a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro LTE. This is especially important at night since I do not want to wake up my wife.\\n\\nWhen it works - which it did at times -, the system is absolutely brilliant. It kind of gave me a new lease of life. I exercise very much, and this system protects me from nocturnal hypoglycemia.\\n\\nBUT: **The pairing of the LibreLink App and the Libre 2 can be called shaky at best.** After a lot of tweaking I found settings on my phone and in the app that I came past the vicious \"No alarms\" warning in the app.\\n\\nDespite this, **the LibreLink App keeps sending me warnings \"No connection with the sensor\" regularly, also at night.** All this while i have my sensor stuck to the backside of my right upper arm and my phone in a holster on my belt or on a charger 1 m from where I sleep!\\n\\nLast night I was woken by several of these false alarms. This morning I got stupid \"no connection alarms\" all through the morning. The program asks you to check you sensor, but I did not do this while i worked only to find out at 11:30 a.m. that at my glucose was 14 mmol/l since I had forgotten to inject my breakfast insulin. So **when the system state is \"No connection\", the system will not warn about hyper- and hypoglucemia.**\\n\\nAbbot Customer Service is pretty much hopeless. The whole system is a black box.

I love the Dexcom, I’d change a few things though. \\n\\nTo the tandem pump wearers, do you wish you had an omnipod? Why/why not? \\n\\nWhat’s it like sleeping with one? \\n\\nDay to day wear? \\n\\nTo my understanding when you want to start an activity you just take it off. The omnipod you have turn off but it stays on you, which is sometimes annoying but I’ve been able to manage. I also like to go swimming/ snorkeling (we live on an island) but I’m worried that each time I go in the water for more than 5minutes the pump will malfunction. That has happened so many times! \\n\\nI’m not trying to knock the omnipod as a product it’s great. It’s low profile and easy to manage. But if there’s something better out there for my lifestyle then I owe it to myself to look.\\n\\nLooking for any new perspective on this! Thanks for reading.',\n",

       " 'Scared and ConfusedHello to everyone who reads this, I’ve been experiencing diabetic symptoms for the past week and finally threw in the towel to go to the doctors. I’m 19 and live in a college campus so I went to my health clinic on campus and immediately the doctor took blood for a glucose test and labs if she felt the need to do them later on. I’ve been excessively thirsty, urinating way more than usual, including during the night which I’ve NEVER done before, extreme fatigue as in passing out right after I get back from class, and above all I’ve been having stomach pain and these horrible horrible migraines after I eat. All I was told was my glucose was high, and that if I still felt bad by the end of the week then I should make another appointment, and if I really felt worse then I was to call the doctor back on her extension. She also prescribed anti nausea meds in case I wanted them but I didn’t plan on picking them up until after seeing how I felt today. Well, yesterday after leaving I had one more class of the day, and then I ate lunch with a friend. Shortly after getting lunch (we stayed and talked for about an hour and a half after eating) I had a migraine and stomach pain again, and just wanted to stick out for as long as I could. At about 7:30 yesterday my head was pounding so bad that I felt like my head was going to explode and the previous ones didn’t feel nearly that bad. I had my friend take me to hospital at around 9:00 when I couldn’t stand it anymore, mind you, I’ve never even been to the hospital let alone an ER, so it’s obviously bad. I tell the nurse everything that’s been going on and that I was tested for diabetes and was told I have high glucose but nothing was ever done, I just kinda got sent away. The doctor just shrugs it off when I tell him and orders a CT scan for my migraine and gives me pain meds that help a ton. The CT scan comes back normal, which isn’t surprising, and I’m told that I was basically wasting the doctors time and that everyone gets headaches, and then the nurse came in and discharged me. At no time did anyone say anything about what I told them, not even after I had called the nurse three separate times to go pee in the four hours that I was in the ER. I feel incredibly stupid. I told the nurse that discharged me that I was afraid of something worse going on, and she told me I was fine and gave me my paperwork.

I now have to pay $200 every time I pick them up. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to lower this cost? Is this something I can discuss with my endro?

My blood sugar level has been in the 100's like 188 to 130 for this past week but every time around 3pm to 5pm my Blood sugar starts to drop to like 90, then 80, then 70, when this happens I drink some orange juice or glucose liquid or gel, then it spikes back up to 130 and stays like that till the morning. I have no idea why my BS keeps dropping like this every day. It's a pattern. I have been calling my doctor about and she now has me Minus 5 units for lunch and now dinner. I know that I just got diagnosed and its a feel out process my doctor doesn't know the right insulin intake yet because it's only been 2 weeks. But this scares me so much and I am afraid to go to sleep every night and is overall very stressful for me. I am doing great with my new diet. I just dip in the middle of the day. I take an AC1 test in a few weeks. I am just so new to this and wonder if anybody can help me or know why this is happening to me. \\nThis is what I have been eating every day- its the same thing everyday lol  \\n--Breakfast at 8am--\\n- 1 Cup of Cheerios cereal\\n- 1 cup of milk\\n- 1 light yogurt   - Meal equals    = 50 Carbs\\n--Snack at 10am--\\n1- boost drink\\n2- Babybel Cheeses\\n1 turkey meat stick, it's a little one  Meal equals = 28 Carbs \\n\\n--Lunch at 12 pm--\\n- McDonald's Southwest Salad with Grilled Chicken \\n- 3 tablespoons of salad dressing ^  \\n- 1 cucumber with 3 cherry tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of Salad dressing.

If anybody out there reads this thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can help me with any information, tips or insight about why the level keeps dropping this reply to this. I am fighting and I will never give up, I am beating this, I just want to be stable blood sugar level and be able to do stuff. Sorry for the insanely long post. I do not know what to do and I am scared. I love you all and God bless, I am on the edge hoping I get a response because this is so new to me. Thanks again.\",\n",

My friend’s partner’s sister was telling me about a paper he wrote on the evolutionary advantage of Type 1 diabetes being a means for surviving the harsh winter cold in ancient Nordic tribes. The reasoning she gave was that a man/woman from these Nordic tribes who had a higher blood sugar would usually run a lot warmer than with a nominal glucose level protecting them better from the harsh cold. \\n\\nStarches would be a type of food less common in a cold Northern climate such as an ancient Nordic tribal region thus they would have a very low carb diet supplemented with fibers and proteins. With modern diets having such a ubiquitous amount of starches and refined carbohydrates, such a Type 1 diabetic scenario is rare to impossible to find naturally occurring today. \\n\\nNow my opinion....ummm, No. This would not be a feasible advantage given the all the bad things Type 1 also would come with.

He was in DKA for weeks and was just diagnosed with Type 1. He is healthier than anyone I’ve known so this was a shock to him, myself, and his family.\\n\\nI spent the most time I could with him in the hospital (apart from going to classes) and learned what they taught him about checking blood sugar and administering insulin. We still have a lot to learn when it comes to trying to stay in range and knowing how much insulin his body needs.\\n\\nSo far, he’s been struggling to get his sugars into the normal range. He has a Bluetooth compatible glucose monitor so he can keep a record of his readings. He’s hoping to get a CGM and an insulin pump at some point.\\n\\nI’ve been trying to give him some emotional support, telling him that it’s okay to be upset and angry. He’s been in good spirits so far (when he was diagnosed he immediately asked his dad to order him a Wilford Brimley shirt and mug) but I know that what he shows on the outside probably doesn’t reflect what’s going on inside. I told him that I’ll be there for him for any support he needs.\\n\\nI’d really like to know some advice and tips for people who have been recently diagnosed, and tips for loved ones who want to support him.

       " 'Misdiagnosed\\n\\nIn March 2018, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was 19 years old and I was around 150lbs 5’6. I found it strange getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, being that I was young and at an average weight. My doctor first put me on metformin, which seemed to work for some time. I was able to get my blood sugar under control and my A1C down to 5.6. After receiving my results, I decided to stop taking metformin to see if I can get normal blood sugar readings without it and for some time they averaged between 80-120. Months go by, and my blood sugar is still at normal range without taking metformin, so I assume I don’t have diabetes anymore. A year goes by and I’m still doing fine. I feel normal. I’m still eating healthy and working out, but I’m not checking my blood sugar because I assume that I’m not a diabetic anymore. Then November 2019 comes around and I start feeling sick (internally). It’s an unexplainable feeling. I started losing weight. I went from 150 down to 118, within a span of a couple months. I started feeling more tired, to the point where I just wanted to sleep in all day. I felt like my life was being drained away. I dealt with this for another month, until I felt that it was time for me to go see a doctor. I decided to go to the ER on 12/30/2019. When I first arrived, my blood pressure was 140/80. I told the doctor my symptoms and they did a couple tests on me and told me I had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). For those of you who don’t know what DKA is, it’s basically a life threatening condition where my body produces excess acids in my blood (ketones) caused by my blood sugar being high for a long period of time. I was hospitalized for 4 days and was put on fluids with an insulin drip. At the hospital, they did several blood tests on me. My potassium was extremely low and My A1C was at 11. They also did a test to see if I was a type 1, because they found it strange that a type 2 was being treated for DKA, since DKA is more prevalent in people with type 1. They were testing  to see if I had pancreatic antibodies, and my results came up as positive. I’m assuming my doctors from 2 years ago didn’t do the pancreatic antibody test because it would have showed up as positive. I’m now feeling so much better now that I’m getting the proper treatment. Im currently taking insulin and eating less carbs/no sugar with a proper workout routine. My blood sugar isn’t quite at the range I want it to be, but day by day it’s getting better.

Recently, my new kidney started rejecting, so my prednisolone was increased to about 40mg every day. A few weeks later, I presented to the ED in pain and was found to have a blood sugar of 25 mmol/L (450 mg/dL). I was immediately put on an insulin 'sliding scale' and have since been discharged with NovoRapid and Levemir.   \\n\\n\\nThey're treating me as a new Type 1 diabetic and seem to think that I will be on insulin permanently, even when my steroids are reduced back to the maintainance levels. I have seen no evidence that I am actually a new Type 1 diabetic, and that this isn't just a temporary steroid-induced event. My sugars were fine before. I've had GAD (negative), C Peptide (600s) and am negative to the insulin resistance antibodies. They're repeating C Peptide.   \\n\\n\\n**Does anyone here have any experience with working out how to differentiate between Type 1 and steroid-induced diabetes? Or had a high dose of steroids 'cause' Type 1?**   \\n\\n\\nWhat I'm hoping, is that I'll continue as a 'Type 1 diabetic' until my steroids are weaned down over the next few months, then I can stop taking insulin but still monitor blood sugar and see whether I fit a diabetic profile or a non-diabetic profile.

My grandmother (moms side) got diagnosed at like 60? Due to a car accident. Through out my life i was warned about this disease and so were my brothers, of course like the rest of us I ignored it and kept being a kid eating anything and everything. My life hasn’t been very great and a lot of it I couldn’t help because I was a kid, I’m currently 23 years old right now. Couple of weeks before I got diagnosed I was urinating more often than usual about every hour an a half during the night. You know those Hawaiian Punch big bottles? Yeah I’d drink about 2 of those within 30 minutes. I was so tired and ended up sleeping all day, l was even craving the most random things I’ve never craved before.. after week 1 of dealing with these symptoms it ended up me having accidents on myself and I thought I was pregnant! So my boyfriend takes me to the hospital on March 26th 2019 and that was the day the doctor came in and said “your sugar level is 700 and a1c is a 14 you’re under DKA” all I could say was ok. I called my mom and said “mom I’m in the hospital and getting put in ICU shortly...I have diabetes.” There was a long silence then I hear her breakdown crying and it made me cry. I ended up being in ICU for a week then they put me in a normal room. Once I was released I felt like I got thrown out here. I don’t have insurance and my job isn’t very good, they’ve cut my hours because of how sick I’ve been. I have a uninsurable doctor that doesn’t listen to me.. she put me on a program with novo to receive insulin (Levemir, Novolog) at first I was taking Levemir twice daily 10 units in the AM 10 units PM, over the courses of months she gradually increased my dosage from 15 am to 15pm then to 20 AM to 20 pm. After her upping my dosage to 15 15 my body was no longer accepting the Levemir... my sugars were still sitting in the 380 - 420 I kept begging her that it’s too much insulin and I explained to her that I feel like I’m killing myself rather than helping myself.. I ended up losing about 30+ pounds in 3 months. I was 145 lbs before diagnosed, today 1/9/2020 I’m now 114lbs and not happy at all... I started having other diabete complications that come with high sugar levels, for the past 2 months i have been completely miserable and alone dealing with this when I’m not even financially stabled or have insurance. On 1/4/2020 I had to leave work and go to the hospital because I legit was going to pass out, turned out I was going under DKA AGAIN and my A1c has went up to 10 (in June it was at 7.5) thank god this hospital I was at put me on a PEN and a different long acting insulin that’s for HIGH BLOOD SUGARS called Lantus! Found out that my doctor has been giving me long acting insulin that’s mostly used for people who have a manageable sugar level but my body has also became resistant to Levemir ... so even when I was injecting myself with insulin.....nothing was happening ... to this day I am still hurt and in shock that this entire time I’ve been using Levemir it wasn’t even doing anything and I thought I was doing something wrong when I’m doing everything I can possibly do... I want to be apart of this community and have people I can talk to when things get overwhelming, my boyfriend is my supporter but he still doesn’t fully understand how much this effects someone, is there anyone else how there who struggles to live daily because they aren’t stable I’m tired of feeling alone with this stupid sickness.',\n",

We will host these threads every 2-4 weeks depending on how many they are used and the thread will stay up for 3 days.\\n\\n**Discord**\\n\\nWe also talked about a Discord a lot.

Going over them with the researcher to verify their integrity and their goals took a long time. We would often exchange several long messages about the survey.

Whenever a survey did get approved nobody was interested in them and they would barely get any comments, upvotes or responses. Understandably so, as someone with diabetes you probably get asked to fill in a survey a lot. If this is something the community doesn't want then the lengthy approval process.\\n\\nWe put up a few rules for content creators and influencers. It's still allowed but it must be kept to reasonable levels. Content creators should also link to their content directly, not just to their profiles. Post that were simply asking for followers/subscribers because the owner of the profile has type 1 diabetes are no longer allowed.\\n\\nAnd finally we set up some guidelines for posting CGM graphs. These are posted quite frequently and they will continue to be allowed but very low effort ones may be removed. The graphs must be accompanied by some context, what are we looking at, what is happening, what is going wrong/good? It should also be clear what the scale of the graph is. Sometimes a graph is posted that doesn't include any numbers at all. And we can't possibly see whether their blood sugar at that moment is 100 mg/dL or 200 mg/dL.

       " 'Can I do this job with type 1 Diabetes?Hi,\\n\\nIve been a type 1 diabetic for 23 years. Im 30 now. I never had a focused career path but over the years I always felt that being a chef was my true calling. I managed to get offered a trial shift as a Kitchen Porter for a restaurant that is at the top of the list for all restaurants id like to work at.\\n\\nI understand working in a professional kitchen is a very fast-paced job and intense. I wonder if I will be able to manage being a Kitchen Porter with my diabetes, for example, if I go into a hypo there will be no time for me to stop washing dishes and take off my gloves and take a candy from my pocket to eat, as I feel this will slow down service and this is a restaurant where they really work at the highest standards. I feel if i mention my diabetes they wont hire me. \\n\\nI was also recently diagnosed with neuropathy in my hands so I wonder if this will also be affected since my hands will be in hot water most of the day and become extremely wrinkly for the whole day.\\n\\nAny type 1 diabetics who work as a Kitchen Porter in a busy restaurant or any other kitchen position? Will it be a hassle for me and the restaurant to go into this career with diabetes?',\n",

Thus far research in the field is extremely sparse; beyond a handful of studies in the 60s and limited work on headaches there is very little formal information regarding the effects of psychedelic drugs on chronic pain. As millennials tend to do, I've turned to the internet for more information and I’ve found some extremely helpful content on Reddit – thank you!\\n\\nPart of my PhD project is interviewing *people who have in the past or are currently treating pain with psychedelics*, in order to understand the phenomenon better. My goal is to gain an understanding of the general topography of self medication in this sphere. I will then use the knowledge gleaned from this to shape future research questions and inform the direction of future clinical trials. All personal data will of course be kept strictly confidential.\\n\\nI am curious if any of you are interested in helping me with this study? The whole process would not take longer than an hour or so and would provide me with valuable data :) You can be anywhere in the world, all that is necessary is an internet connection and skype/zoom/etc. If this is something you'd be interested in, please let me know!\\n\\nLove to all\",\n",
       " 'Question about the onset of your T1My son is 6. He has an uncle and a grandfather that both have T1 diabetes. As such, I am very concerned about watching for indications that he could develop T1 diabetes. \\n\\nRecently, he has become super irritable, fatigued (he says after he eats he gets tired), he throws up after exercise or play, I swear his breath is fruity smelling (but what do I know, I’m probably paranoid). He is always talking about how his stomach hurts. (Could be anxiety.)\\n\\nHe is naturally thin, to the point of skin and bones and NEVER wants to eat because it’s a little control game that he plays about what I serve but when he does eat he devours everything in his path. He does not seem to drink excessively or pee more than usual but I don’t know about what’s happening at school. \\n\\nAnyway, his father (who has lived with diabetic family members his whole life) seems unconcerned but to be fair, he sort of lives in an optimistic world where nothing ever goes wrong. \\n\\nHe says that his family members developed T1 after a significant illness and that their immune systems went haywire after a flu or a bout with the mumps. And that I have no cause for concern. \\n\\nHow did your T1 reveal itself? Were thirst and hunger a huge part of your symptoms? Are there any of you whole developed this without those features? I am sorry to ask, I just have this creeping suspicion that something is wrong and don’t think doctors will take it seriously because two tell-tale (hunger, thirst) signs are not immediately clear.

       " 'Should I worry more about my diabete for my own health\\'s sake?So here\\'s the thing. I (20F) got diagnosed with T1D 5 years ago. Overall my diabete has been pretty well balanced according to my specialists (overall being the keyword here). I\\'ve never lost conscious and my \"records\" are probably around -20 and +500. Of course I do feel bad in these cases but generally, I don\\'t really feel the high sugar (starting around 180 in my standards) and don\\'t do a lot of low sugar (less than 60). \\n\\nHere is the thing. When I first got hospitalized, I was told about low or highs being dangerous but either the medics were too positive, either was I? I ended up not really considering diabete as \"risky\". Actually I was only clearly told one can die of low sugar when one of my devices has a serial problem so everyone who might be concerned received a mail about it where they mentioned lows can be deadly. And this was like, a few years after my diagnosis? And yea, since my diabete remains quite equilibrate most of the time it does not really help taking it seriously.\\n\\nLately I\\'ve been wondering if I\\'m being too \"unworried\" about my diabete. I mean, I got drunk the other night had a total blackout and I never thought about my diabete before doing it? (I ended up surprisingly fine , when I checked my glucose scores in the morning they were completely normal and since no one at the party knew how to use my devices I guess I still handled my diabete when drunk?) Sometimes I also eat shit tons of candies or other highly sugary snacks without caring about my diabete and just check myself frequently afterwards to inject more if I need it , but don\\'t really mind getting high sugar for a time. I\\'m also supposed to change my maths settings for the basal and bolus but have been too lazy to do it so I try to calculate it myself by decreasing the number my device advises me, but very often mess it up.\\n\\nAm I being too \"cool\" about my diabete? Should I worry my lack of care strikes back to me one day? And if so, what could I do to change this? I mean just telling me to stop eating lots of sugar or drink at all would be too much asked so what in between could I find?\\n\\nThanks for reading it through, happy new year to everyone and take care!',\n",

       " 'My thoughts on Control IQ vs DIY LoopingOkay, so I have been using Tandem\\'s Control IQ for the past 3 days and here are some of my thoughts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all, before this experiment, I was DIY looping with Omnipod (off-label). Being off-label, this system has it\\'s quirks, but there are a couple features, intensity, and target settings I really miss while using Control IQ with Tandem. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBefore jumping into what I like and don\\'t like about Control IQ, I want to give a brief overview of how Basal IQ works. \\n\\nFirst off, Control IQ bases its basal change off of your programmed basal. The Control IQ uses the Dexcom G6 CGM reading (it\\'s only integrated with Dexcomg G6) to base if your basal amount should be increased and use a correction bolus, just be increased, no change at all, be decreased, or be completely suspended. The adjusted basal amount is based on what your CGM reading is predicted to be in 30 minutes. Below is the Control IQ tier system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n ≥  **180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go above 180 mg/dL within 30 minutes, there is an increased basal AND an Automated correction bolus. The correction bolus is 60% of your usual correction factor with your target blood glucose set at 110 mg/dL every 60 minutes. This is the ONLY hybrid closed loop system that has automated correction bolusing.\\n\\n**160 - 180 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **increased**. \\n\\n**112.5 - 159 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **not changed**. \\n\\n**112.4 - 70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go in this range within 30 minutes, basal is **decreased**. \\n\\n ≤  **70 mg/dL:** If CGM reading is predicted to go below 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, basal is **suspended**. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy thoughts...\\n\\nAfter about 3 days of using Control IQ, my average is higher than what I like. However there are less lows which is awesome. BUT, my biggest complaint so far is postprandial blood sugar due to the pump not knowing carbs on board like with looping.  The reason for this is that unlike looping, Control IQ software doesn\\'t not use **carbs on board**. Meaning that the Control IQ doesnt have memory of the carbs you have recently eaten.  This would be fine, if you didn\\'t have to use the CGM reading, but if you eat multiple amounts or do a prebolus, the Tandem pump doesn\\'t remember how many carbs on are board. \\n\\nFor instance, I ate about 30 grams for lunch but was sitting at 82 mg/dL so my Tandem pump recommended a reduced  bolus of 0.6 U. I then \"trying to be good\" used the recommendation. I then decided to have an apple, so I added that I was now about to eat 20 grams, but because my blood sugar was still below target at 84 mg/dL, the Tandem pump did not recommend to give take the fiull amount of insulin, it actually recommended not to take any additional insulin although I know that the reverse correction with my first 30 grams consumed had already been taken into account. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to an hour later I am sitting at 175 mg/dL. This isn\\'t super high, but this could have been completely avoided. ALSO, I couldn\\'t stand to not take anything for the apple so if I had completely obeyed the Control IQ suggestions, I would have been much higher. It recommended 0U, but I took 0.7U (usually I\\'m about 1U for an apple). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other feature I\\'m not crazy about is the tube. I had used a medtronic 530G pump for years, so I thought tubes were just life as a T1D, but using an Omnipod with looping was definitely nice, especially during workouts. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple features I DO like...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like that the software works, all the time. Even if it isn\\'t nearly as aggressive as I would like it to be, I can count on a decent connection from my pump to my CGM so I can count on constant basal adjustments. With my closed loop Omnipod system, I would have to constantly close and reopen the app or toggle the rileylink switch to make sure the rileylink (device used to connect pod to phone) and phone were connected and working. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s also nice not to have to carry an additional device (the rileylink), but I am now carrying a heavy Tandem pump. So that\\'s not a big change.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like the sleep feature. This allows for a tighter range, but doesn\\'t allow for the automated correction bolus. However if your blood sugar is predicted to go above 120 mg/dL, your basal is increased. With normal settings, basal is usually increased if you are predicted to hit 160 mg/dL or above. \\n\\nOh, and I love that my CGM reading is already uploaded on the bolus screen which is new feature for Tandem, however this was already a feature for Omnipod looping system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOverall I think for the masses, Control IQ could be rather helpful tool. However,  I am feeling DIY looping with Omnipod works better for me, but that is a personal choice and I want to continue to use Control IQ for a couple of days. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTAKEAWAY: Control IQ is less work but doesn\\'t allow the as tight control compared to looping. DIY Looping may take more bug fixing and be more hands on, but I like the control, and I greatly miss the carbs on board feature.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*This is just a short snapshot, I can review and report more as I use the Control IQ. I have early access to this because I\\'m a T1D, CDE, and a RDN. It\\'s a bit of work to review and report, but I hope this information is helpful to you.*',\n",

       " 'Social aspects of t1d- and insurance info!Hello all! I am a fellow autoimmune disease sufferer, in my case, my autoimmune disease attacks my cartilage and tendons, and it can cause me severe pain and fatigue. I also take biologic meds for my illness, and I realize that people like myself have diabetics to thank for the development of biologic medications which are now used for lots of different illnesses, including autoimmune conditions as well as cancer. \\n\\nI’ve known a few folks over the years who have type 1 diabetes, and aside from seeing them occasionally administer their insulin or talk about how a special pump type device helps them manage their diabetes, the illness doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on the person’s daily life, and their overall ability to function and work a normal job. \\n\\nI’ve recently seen in the news some tragic horror stories, where diabetics have to run Go Fund Me’s in order to cover the costs of insulin, or having to resort to “Walmart insulin” (that sounds atrocious) when they don’t have insurance, and there was a story about a 27 year old guy with type 1 who died as a result of not having insurance. \\n\\nNO ONE should die needlessly from a medical condition that is as easily treated as type 1 diabetes. Our current healthcare climate got me thinking about some things, and I was wondering how these sorts of issues would affect someone with t1d. \\n\\nWhat are your options where you live, in the event that you don’t have health insurance? How would you access insulin if your insurance wasn’t available? \\n\\nSome states offer Medicaid, and among the states that offer Medicaid, some offer a program called “Medicaid buyin” where people with qualifying conditions can purchase Medicaid insurance for far less than the regular insurance market. Have you had to make the choice between keeping your income below a certain threshold in order to qualify for Medicaid, or face the potential of losing your insurance if you make more than the maximum that qualifies people for Medicaid?\\n\\nRegarding employment, how difficult is it to find a job that offers full time employment with good health insurance, as opposed to the numerous companies that only hire part time employees so that they don’t have to cover health insurance? \\n\\nIf you do have a job that offers you health insurance, have you faced poor working conditions or unpleasant issues at your job due to the fact that your employer realizes that your ability to stay alive relies on the fact that you need health insurance? The idea of an employer realizing that you need to keep your job or face losing access to a medication that you need to stay alive could potentially create some extremely unpleasant power dynamics in a work environment. I don’t feel like an employer should have any say whatsoever in a person’s ability to access a life-sustaining medication, this should only be a discussion between a person and their doctor, that’s it. \\n\\nI realize that people with t1d need insulin to stay alive, but are generally able-bodied and have the ability to work a normal job with normal physical demands. This would also include working long hours, as well as overtime. Someone like myself wouldn’t be able to do many of these things thanks to the numerous issues my autoimmune disease causes. Do you feel that your condition is sometimes overlooked or minimized, compared to people like myself who deal with limitations to my physical abilities? My condition wouldn’t endanger my life directly if I were to go without my meds, but my quality of life would be so horrible without meds that I wouldn’t want to remain in that state for any length of time. \\n\\nAnd, lastly, how does your illness impact things for you socially? Are there social situations, job situations, or interpersonal situations with relationships where your need to administer insulin has provoked a negative, judgmental or condescending reaction from the people around you? How have strangers reacted? How have friends and/or significant others reacted?\\n\\nI live in Colorado, where we have the option for Medicaid buyin for people with qualifying conditions. Here are the links for that, as well as the listing of adult conditions that qualify for our state. Your state may have a similar buyin program, I wanted to let people know that they may have more insurance options than they may have realized. \\n\\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/hcpf/medicaid-buy-program-working-adults-disabilities\\n\\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm\\n\\nAlso- feel free to ask me any questions about my autoimmune disease!

And as I've explained to friends who have asked how they can help, only people with T1D can really understand the problems that come with it. I honestly don't think anyone who doesn't live with this in some capacity can understand constantly maintaining blood sugar levels, calculating insulin doses, giving yourself constant injections, etc. I know what it's like to think about T1D and just have your mood drop. I know what it's like to cry, and to just feel anger, and sadness, and a tidal wave of emotion hit you during a routine diabetic activity, whatever it may be. And I'm trying to say that it's okay. It's okay to hurt. It's okay to be angry, to be sad, to freak out, to cry, to express whatever you might feel. Just remember that you're stronger than this and that you can fight it.

She told me that she never had to diagnose anyone with diabetes before, this was her first time. She prescribed me insulin and all of the supplies that I would need and that was it. I wasn't given instruction on how to use the needles, how to do it safe and sterile, how any of it works, how easy it is to take 2 units too much and hypo.

Given that I have always, and intend to continue, eating a fairly low carb diet (normally 50-75g carb a day), I’m struggling to get a sensible value for a correction factor / insulin sensitivity. Honeymoon very much still in operation which I know complicates things but I take very small doses of insulin (6 basal and yesterday 7 rapid). The article online suggests taking 1700/TDI (total daily fast-acting insulin) to establish corrective but this yields a figure of 1 unit to 243 mg/dL (or as us Brits would say 13.5 mmol/L). This is FAR too high. I’m at 5.8 right now and I know if I injected a unit I would go hypo but I wouldn’t drop THAT far. \\n\\nIt seems to me that this is an inevitable problem with a lower carb diet. I don’t take much rapid insulin because I do not consume very many carbs that need balancing. This in itself doesn’t mean I am insulin sensitive (although I appreciate that I am). I could just go high, wait until there is no insulin in the system and then give myself a unit to determine a correction factor experimentally but it strikes me that this is likely to yield a poor precision if I were to do it again on another day... \\n\\nHow can we distinguish an individual with a moderate insulin sensitivity and low carb diet from a higher carb diet individual with high insulin sensitivity?? \\n\\n\\nThe deets; \\n- 31 yr old male\\n- diagnosis 3 months ago\\n- freestyle libre with novorapid and basarglar. \\n\\nThanks!',\n",

Not sure if that has to do with the loss of background lantus, but I’m wondering if you all have any tips or have noticed that?

       " 'Very Important Question. If anybody could help with what they know, an answer, I’d greatly appreciate it very much.Hi, I’m Kaylynn. My husband is a severe type 1 diabetic. He was diagnosed a lot later in life as an adult. My husband takes 2 different insulin’s 1 of them is long acting Lantus &amp; the other is fast acting Humalog. \\nUnfortunately &amp; absolutely devastating my husband is in our County Jail, he has been they’re since 9-27-19 - presently. We had talked to somebody who works there, who answered questions we had, I had brought up my husband’s diabetes &amp; the difficulties he faces with his diabetes, this woman “assured” me that they had 3 different licensed nurses who rotate shifts she also assured me they were very experienced and “knew what they were doing” They’re is also a licensed doctor who works a bit different, when my husband first went in it took 2-3 weeks for the doctor to talk with him, learn about his medical conditions/medications all that stuff. He made a sheet with the instructions to be followed by nurses daily and those instructions are @ 7am he gets both Lantus &amp; Humalog as well as his morning medications they approved of, @ 4pm the same things just a bit different he gets both insulin’s then the night medications that were approved. Also at those times 7am they check his sugar and also check it at 4pm. That’s it. \\nOkay, now onto the absolute bs that in rages me so much, please tell me your honest thoughts on absolutely everything I’m saying, is there anything I can try to do about this? Recommendations? I’d very much appreciate it. I’m lost with what I can even do about this. 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️🤦🏻\\u200d♀️🙏🏻😔 I know this is really long, please bare with me, I’m new here &amp; trying my best to explain everything in the best way I can for others to understand. Okay here we go. \\nSo, this is what started first then so on, so on \\nI received a call from the county jail from a nurse who asked me to bring in insulin because he out and also said exactly “he doesn’t want to wait till 7 to take what insulin they have provided by them I’m guessing the jail because he missed his morning dose because these people knew he was close to needing a new refill but I guess didn’t care. So I got up, got dressed &amp; got what we had at home and took it up there I also had wrote a note saying this insulin I’ve brought to you all today is all that we had at our house. I added the pharmacy we use and said I recommended that they call &amp; explain that you all would need to receive his medications since I did not have anymore at our home, &amp; that since you all are administrating his medications to him, calling in refills, etc all that would be easiest since you all would know when to call in for refills. And I had assumed that would be what I was supposed to do because he was in jail, and we don’t know when or if he’s going to be released. \\nI know this is very long so I’m gonna make bulletin points of the rest important details than explain the last of this because it’s very important. \\n• I had received a call later that evening from my husband and I was informed that the nurse who read my note informed him that they were not going to do that “contact the pharmacy” because that’s not they’re responsibility. And that whoever basically is his other half, emergency contact, on his HIPPA paperwork which would obviously be me who would be responsible basically to make sure he gets his medications. \\n•So what I’ve been dealing with lately is when he calls (not every call) but have to ask if he knows how much of his meds he has left. If he can find out how much he has left because obviously you have to call when you start running low that way you won’t really have to wait for them to be ready you can go ahead pick them up &amp; then I could get them to the jail so he can stay some what on a routine. \\n•These nurses have already upped both of his insulin dose when he repeatedly told them that could kill him, that what they were wanting to do would not “help him at all” they forced him to take it and he nearly OD. So then they put him back on his original dose\\nThere’s been so much damn more. This is already long as hell. \\nSo lastly they told him today they are planning to completely take him off his 2 original insulin’s and put him only on Novolog 70/30 and he said no he wouldn’t take it and they told him he would have to would basically force him. \\n•He has filled out multiple grievances etc etc nobody cares and those nurses insist that my husband doesn’t know what he’s talking about having to do with his insulin, but 100% without a doubt think they know what they’re doing!! \\nThey’re wrong af, changing it to novolog can hurt him it is not interchangeable. There so bad to where they think the perfect dose of Humalog would be 20-30units when his sugars to high?!?! That would kill him!!! \\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP PLEASE PLEASE DO!! I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.',\n",
